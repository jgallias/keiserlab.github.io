Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to get a complete clinical and mycological picture of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in respiratory medicine ICU of a tertiary care hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;From the cohort of 235 patients only one had proven IA. Based on AspICU algorithm, 21 had putative IA (8.9%), 12 were colonised (5.1%).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Adjusting the confounding factors, significant risk factors for IA were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), temperature of ≥38°C, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The best predictor of IA was AspICU algorithm (AUC, 1) followed by serum galactomannan antigen (GM) cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.822). For 37% of patients, IA diagnoses was made earlier with serum GM than radiology. There were 70/235 (29.8%) deaths within 30 days of enrolment in the study. &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; culture positivity (34/235, 14.5%) was associated with very high mortality (27/34, 79.4%), (p&amp;lt;0.05). The best predictor of mortality was GM cut-off (≥1.24) calculated based on AspICU algorithm (AUC, 0.835).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study imparts the focus on relatively underestimated &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; infections prevalent in ICUs.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chromogranin A (CgA) is a plasma biomarker widely used in the follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). However, its accuracy as a tumor biomarker is relatively low because plasma CgA can increase also in patients with other diseases or in subjects treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), a class of widely-used drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the attempt to identify a more reliable biomarker for NENs, we investigated, by ELISA, the circulating levels of full-length CgA (CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt;) and of various CgA-derived fragments in 17 patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs, 10 healthy controls, and 21 healthy volunteers before and after treatment with PPIs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients with ileal or pancreatic NENs showed increased plasma levels of total-CgA and CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-76&lt;/sub&gt; fragment (vasostatin-1, VS-1) compared to controls [median (25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-percentiles); total-CgA: 1.85 nM (1.01–4.28) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.75 nM (0.52–0.89), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004; VS-1: 2.76 nM (1.09–7.10) &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; 0.29 nM (0.26–0.32), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively], but not of CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-439&lt;/sub&gt; or CgA&lt;sub&gt;1-373&lt;/sub&gt; fragment.

The ability of astrocytes to rapidly clear synaptic glutamate and purposefully release the excitatory transmitter is critical in the functioning of synapses and neuronal circuits. Dysfunctions of these homeostatic functions have been implicated in the pathology of brain disorders such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the reasons for these dysfunctions are not clear from experimental data and computational models have been developed to provide further understanding of the implications of glutamate clearance from the extracellular space, as a result of EAAT2 downregulation: although they only partially account for the glutamate clearance process. In this work, we develop an explicit model of the astrocytic glutamate transporters, providing a more complete description of the glutamate chemical potential across the astrocytic membrane and its contribution to glutamate transporter driving force based on thermodynamic principles and experimental data. Analysis of our model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate content due to glutamine synthetase downregulation also results in increased postsynaptic quantal size due to gliotransmission. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate could prolong the time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and enhances astrocyte-induced slow inward currents, causing a disruption to the clarity of synaptic signalling and the occurrence of intervals of higher frequency postsynaptic firing. Overall, our work distilled the necessity of a low astrocytic glutamate concentration for reliable synaptic transmission of information and the possible implications of enhanced glutamate levels as in epilepsy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cj--aAPMpfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006040</link><fingerprint>b1bfb7b8</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Bronac Flanagan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bronac Flanagan, Liam McDaid, John Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the histopathological changes in the patellofemoral joint using a rat model of osteoarthritis that was induced using monosodium iodoacetate, and to establish a novel model of patellofemoral osteoarthritis in a rat model using histopathological analysis. Sixty male rats were used. Osteoarthritis was induced through a single intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate in both knee joints. Animals were equally divided into two experimental groups based on the monosodium iodoacetate dose: 0.2 mg and 1.0 mg. Histopathological changes in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint and the infrapatellar fat pad were examined at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the monosodium iodoacetate injection. In the 1.0-mg group, the representative histopathological findings of osteoarthritis were observed in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint over time. Additionally, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International scores of the patellofemoral joint increased over time. The synovitis scores of the infrapatellar fat pad in both groups were highest at 3 days, and then the values decreased over time. The fibrosis score of the infrapatellar fat pad in the 1.0-mg group increased with time, whereas the fibrosis score in the 0.2-mg group remained low. Representative histopathological findings of osteoarthritis were observed in the articular cartilage of the patellofemoral joint in a rat model of osteoarthritis induced using monosodium iodoacetate. With appropriate selection, this model may be regarded as an ideal patellofemoral osteoarthritis model.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196625</link><fingerprint>e55f8084</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Ikufumi Takahashi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ikufumi Takahashi, Taro Matsuzaki, Hiroshi Kuroki, Masahiro Hoso&lt;/p&gt;

We applied our proposed method on Behcet&apos;s disease (BD) GWAS dataset from Japanese population. Antigen Processing and Presentation pathway is ranked first with 16 highly affected paths. Th17 cell differentiation, Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Jak-STAT signaling, and Circadian rhythm pathways are also found to be containing highly affected paths.

Mitochondrial function affects many aspects of cellular physiology, and, most recently, its role in epigenetics has been reported. Mechanistically, how mitochondrial function alters DNA methylation patterns in the nucleus remains ill defined. Using a cell culture model of induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, in this study we show that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an early transcriptional and metabolic program centered on the metabolism of various amino acids, including those involved in the methionine cycle. We find that this program also increases DNA methylation, which occurs primarily in the genes that are differentially expressed. Maintenance of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) oxidation in the context of mtDNA loss rescues methionine salvage and polyamine synthesis and prevents changes in DNA methylation and gene expression but does not affect serine/folate metabolism or transsulfuration. This work provides a novel mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and epigenetic regulation of gene expression that involves polyamine and methionine metabolism responding to changes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Given the implications of these findings, future studies across different physiological contexts and in vivo are warranted.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wIS7B5HAgw8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005707</link><fingerprint>589911b1</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Oswaldo A.

Currently, information on nearshore reef-associated fisheries is frequently disparate or incomplete, creating a challenge for effective management. This study utilized an existing non-commercial fishery dataset from Hawaiʻi, covering the period 2004–13, to estimate a variety of fundamental fishery parameters, including participation, effort, gear use, and catch per unit effort. We then used those data to reconstruct total catches per island. Non-commercial fisheries in this case comprise recreational, subsistence, and cultural harvest, which may be exchanged, but are not sold. By combining those data with reported commercial catch data, we estimated annual catch of nearshore reef-associated fisheries in the main Hawaiian Islands over the study period to be 1,167,758 ± 43,059 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (mean ± standard error). Average annual commercial reef fish catch over the same time period—184,911 kg year&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—was 16% of the total catch, but that proportion varied greatly among islands, ranging from 23% on Oʻahu to 5% on Molokaʻi. These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</link><fingerprint>7ed2156e</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Kaylyn S.

These results emphasize the importance of reef fishing in Hawaiʻi for reasons beyond commerce, such as food security and cultural practice, and highlight the large differences in fishing practices across the Hawaiian Islands.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae5:9f3b30f2</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</originId><title>Estimating nearshore coral reef-associated fisheries production from the main Hawaiian Islands</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195840</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 Levels are Associated with an Increased Risk of Anemia Development in Patients with Nondialysis Chronic Kidney Disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 Levels are Associated with an Increased Risk of Anemia Development in Patients with Nondialysis Chronic Kidney Disease, Published online: 08 May 2018;

A universal turnaround has been detected in many countries of the World from shrinking to expanding forests. The forest area of western Europe expanded already in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Such early trends of forest resources cannot be associated with the rapid rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide nor with the anthropogenic climate change, which have taken place since the mid 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. Modern, most recent spatial patterns of forest expansions and contractions do not correlate with the geography of climate trends nor with dry versus moist areas. Instead, the forest resources trends of nations correlate positively with UNDP Human Development Index. This indicates that forest resources of nations have improved along with progress in human well-being. Highly developed countries apply modern agricultural methods on good farmlands and abandon marginal lands, which become available for forest expansion. Developed countries invest in sustainable programs of forest management and nature protection. Our findings are significant for predicting the future of the terrestrial carbon sink. They suggest that the large sink of carbon recently observed in forests of the World will persist, if the well-being of people continues to improve. However, despite the positive trends in domestic forests, developed nations increasingly outsource their biomass needs abroad through international trade, and all nations rely on unsustainable energy use and wasteful patterns of material consumption.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196248</link><fingerprint>d54a7e1</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Pekka E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Polypharmacy is common in older patients but relationships between polypharmacy and common co-morbid conditions have not been elucidated. Our goal was to determine relationships between daily oral medication use and common co-morbid disease dyads and triads using comprehensive medication and diagnostic data from a national sample of nursing homes (NH).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Retrospective, cross-sectional study.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of U.S. Nursing Homes.&lt;/p&gt; Participants &lt;p&gt;Nationally representative sample of long-term stay residents (n = 11734, 75% women) aged 65 years or older.&lt;/p&gt; Measurements &lt;p&gt;Diagnosis and medication data were analyzed. Proportion of daily oral medication intake attributed to treatment of common two-(dyads) and three-disease (triad) combinations and “health maintenance” agents (vitamins, dietary supplements, stool softeners without related diagnoses) was determined.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Older NH residents received slightly &gt;8 oral medications/day with the number related to number of medical diagnoses (p &amp;lt; .0001). One third of chronic oral medication intake/day (excluding health maintenance agents) could be attributed to dyad combinations and about half to triad combinations despite an average of 5 other diagnoses. Triads were comprised of hypertension +/- arthritis +/- vascular disease, +/-depression, +/- osteoporosis +/- gastroesophageal reflux disease and +/- diabetes. Health maintenance agents accounted for 15–17% of daily oral medication intake (1.4 medications) such that almost two-thirds of daily oral medications were attributable to disease triads plus health maintenance. Fewer medications were prescribed for NH residents over age 85 (decreased ACE inhibitor and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor USE (p &amp;lt; .001)) while use of Alzheimer medications was higher (p &amp;lt; .01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large fraction of daily oral medications were attributed to management of common co-morbid disease dyads and triads.

Efforts to reduce polypharmacy and unwanted medication interactions could focus on regimens for common co-morbid dyads and triads in varying populations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb96:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196109</originId><title>Medication burden attributable to chronic co-morbid conditions in the very old and vulnerable</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196109</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196109</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524807007000</published><fingerprint>a1b62520</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Shuo Feng</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5ef:fc1f8953</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</originId><title>Entropic elasticity based coarse-grained model of lipid membranes</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</href></item></alternate><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023562?af=R</link></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524721518000</published><fingerprint>85a4a84f</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Lorenzo Duso</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><crawled>1524900763427</crawled><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 16, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1630b2b1723:100d5e9:fc1f8953</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021242?af=R</originId><title>Selected-node stochastic simulation algorithm</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021242?af=R</href></item></alternate><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021242?af=R</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;78,000-year-old record of Middle and Later stone age innovation in an East African tropical forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;78,000-year-old record of Middle and Later stone age innovation in an East African tropical forest, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04057-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04057-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Most of the archaeological record of the Middle to Later Stone Age transition comes from southern Africa.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><published>1525813200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</link><fingerprint>8f86ac9c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rebecca L.

The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been decreasing globally, but the growing effects of HCV-related morbidity and mortality remain of concern. Advances in curative medicine, involving direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), have led many countries to aim to eradicate HCV. Information on epidemiology and disease burden is essential for national policy development. Thus, this study aimed to determine the HCV-related hepatic disease burden in areas of Thailand with high and average HCV prevalence in order to extrapolate the viral burden across Thailand. Patients previously diagnosed as positive for anti-HCV antibodies were recruited to assess chronic HCV infection (CHC) status, liver function, HCV-RNA level and hepatic fibrosis. The number of patients eligible for Universal Health Coverage (UC) scheme and the approximately required expenditure on interferon (IFN)-based treatment were estimated. In areas of both high (12%) and average (2%) HCV viremic prevalence, over half of the patients (52.2% to 62.5%) had advanced liver fibrosis (F3 and F4). A striking percentage of patients with F4 (38.9%) were found in the high-prevalence area, while comparable proportions of advanced liver fibrosis presented in the two areas and disease burden peaked at 50–59 years. Under the current UC program treatment scenario, 78–83% of CHC patients with stage F2–F4 fibrosis were eligible for treatment. The estimated expenditure required for overall CHC treatment across the whole country was 1,240 million USD at this current status, but the declining cost of generic DAA-based therapy may reduce the requirement to &amp;lt;90 million USD. This study provides information on the estimated number of CHC patients, liver disease burden and expenditure requirements for Thailand. To eliminate HCV by 2030, proactive government strategies raising public health to minimize transmission and emphasizing targeted screen-and-treatment programs, novel therapeutic guideline development for decentralizing treatment, and effective budget allocation are urgently needed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><published>1524603600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196301</link><fingerprint>f2997682</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rujipat Wasitthankasem</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rujipat Wasitthankasem, Preeyaporn Vichaiwattana, Nipaporn Siripon, Nawarat Posuwan, Chompoonut Auphimai, Sirapa Klinfueng, Napha Thanetkongtong, Viboonsak Vuthitanachot, Supapith Saiyatha, Chaiwat Thongmai, Saowakon Sochoo, Natnada Pongsuwan, Kittiyod Poovorawan, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Yong Poovorawan&lt;/p&gt;

During this regenerative window, cardiac energy metabolism shifts from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation, and recent evidence suggests that metabolism may participate in controlling cardiomyocyte cell cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating the loss of postnatal cardiac regeneration are not fully understood. Objective: This study aims at providing an integrated resource of mRNA, protein and metabolite changes in the neonatal heart to identify metabolism-related mechanisms associated with the postnatal loss of regenerative capacity. Methods and Results: Mouse ventricular tissue samples taken on postnatal days 1, 4, 9 and 23 (P01, P04, P09 and P23, respectively) were analyzed with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and global proteomics and metabolomics. Differential expression was observed for 8547 mRNAs and for 1199 of the 2285 quantified proteins. Furthermore, 151 metabolites with significant changes were identified. Gene ontology analysis, KEGG pathway analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering were used to identify biological processes and metabolic pathways either up- or downregulated on all three levels. Among these were branched chain amino acid degradation (upregulated at P23) and production of free saturated and monounsaturated medium- to long-chain fatty acids (upregulated at P04 and P09; downregulated at P23). Moreover, the HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS)-mediated mevalonate pathway and ketogenesis were transiently activated. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGCS in primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes reduced the percentage of BrdU+ cardiomyocytes, providing evidence that the mevalonate and ketogenesis routes may participate in regulating cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Conclusions: This is the first systems-level resource combining data from genome-wide transcriptomics with global quantitative proteomics and untargeted metabolomics analyses of the mouse heart throughout the early postnatal period. This integrated multi-level data of molecular changes associated with the loss of cardiac regeneration may open up new possibilities for the development of regenerative therapies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/302802v1?rss=1</link><published>1524466800000</published><fingerprint>bbce4775</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Talman, V.</name></author><description>Rationale: Mammals lose the ability to regenerate their hearts within one week after birth.

This research identifies which shots types in goalball are most likely to lead to a goal and herby provides background information for improving training and competition. Therefore, we observed 117 elite level matches including 20,541 shots played in the regular situation (3 vs. 3) using notational analysis. We characterized the shots by using their target sector (A-E), technique (traditional, rotation), trajectory (flat, bounce), angle (straight, diagonal and outcome (goal, violation, out, blocked). In our data, a χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-test showed a significantly higher goal rate for men (3.9%) compared to women (3.0%). For men, we found a significantly higher goal rate in the intersection sectors between players C (5.6%), D (4.9%), and in the outer sector A. In sector A, goal rate was higher only for straight shots (6.6%). Technique and trajectory did not affect goal rate for men, but flat shots showed a higher violation rate (3.2%) compared to bounce shouts (2.0%). In women&apos;s goalball, goal rate was higher only on sector D (4.4%). Bounce-rotation shots were the most successful (5.5%). We conclude that men should focus on shots to sectors C and D (called pocket) and straight shots to sector A, as long as there are no other tactical considerations. Women should shoot primarily towards the pocket. It might also be worth playing more bounce-rotation shots and practicing them in training.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196679</link><fingerprint>aefefdd4</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Daniel Link</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Link, Christoph Weber&lt;/p&gt;

Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an essential exonuclease in mammalian cells, and numerous in vivo and in vitro data evidenced its participation in immunity regulation and in genotoxicity remediation. In these very complicated cellular functions, the molecular mechanisms by which duplex DNA substrates are processed are mostly elusive because of the lack of structure information. Here, we report multiple crystal structures of TREX1 complexed with various substrates to provide the structure basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes. The substrates were designed to mimic the intermediate structural DNAs involved in various repair pathways. The results showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 served to cap the nonscissile 5′-end of the DNA for precise removal of the short 3′-overhang in L- and Y-structural DNA or to wedge into the double-stranded region for further digestion along the duplex. Biochemical assays were also conducted to demonstrate that TREX1 can indeed degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a full extent. Overall, this study provided unprecedented knowledge at the molecular level on the enzymatic substrate processing involved in prevention of immune activation and in responses to genotoxic stresses. For example, Arg128, whose mutation in TREX1 was linked to a disease state, were shown to exhibit consistent interaction patterns with the nonscissile strand in all of the structures we solved. Such structure basis is expected to play an indispensable role in elucidating the functional activities of TREX1 at the cellular level and in vivo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nbs4P4qHduo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005653</link><fingerprint>ca2cb6f6</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Kuan-Wei Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Wei Huang, Tung-Chang Liu, Ruei-Yue Liang, Lee-Ya Chu, Hiu-Lo Cheng, Jhih-Wei Chu, Yu-Yuan Hsiao&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction is thought to be an early indicator of risk for cardiovascular disease and has been associated with both stress and depression in adults and adolescents. Less is known of these relationships in younger populations, where the origins of CVD is thought to manifest. This study examined the effects of questionnaire derived psychosocial stress and depressive symptoms on endothelial function among children, following them through to adolescence.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Participants were 203 grade 2 children (111 girls; M age = 7.6 ± 0.3 years) from the LOOK longitudinal study, who were followed through to adolescence (16 years). Self-reported psychosocial stress and depression were assessed using the validated Children’s Stress Questionnaire and a modified and validated version of the Children’s Depression Inventory respectively; endothelial function was assessed using EndoPAT 2000 system at follow-up only; and adjustments were made for fitness, pubertal development and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Although all relationships occurred in the hypothesised direction, no cross-sectional or prospective evidence of early symptoms of psychological stress or depression being associated with endothelial dysfunction was found among our asymptomatic cohort of adolescents (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; .05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In contrast to previous findings in adolescents, our data provided little evidence of any relationship between current or previous psychosocial stress or depression and endothelial function in 16-year-old boys and girls. However, our data need to be interpreted alongside the potential limitations in the sensitivity associated with self-report methods for detecting psychological distress of children.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196137</link><fingerprint>72ce4212</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Lisa S.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility.

The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable performance indicators for the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms’ export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><published>1525467600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196804</link><fingerprint>5e9f7efc</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Mónica Clavel San Emeterio</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica Clavel San Emeterio, Rubén Fernández-Ortiz, Jesús Arteaga-Ortiz, Pablo Dorta-González&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstetric complications and maternal deaths can be prevented through safe delivery process. Facility based delivery significantly reduces maternal mortality by increasing women’s access to skilled personnel attendance. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, most deliveries take place without skilled attendants and outside health facilities. Utilization of facility-based delivery is affected by socio-cultural norms and several other factors including cost, long distance, accessibility and availability of quality services. This study examined country-level variations of the self-reported causes of not choosing to deliver at a health facility.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional data on 37,086 community dwelling women aged between 15–49 years were collected from DHS surveys in Ethiopia (n = 13,053) and Nigeria (n = 24,033). Outcome variables were the self-reported causes of not delivering at health facilities which were regressed against selected sociodemographic and community level determinants. In total eight items complaints were identified for non-use of facility delivery: 1) Cost too much 2) Facility not open, 3) Too far/no transport, 4) don’t trust facility/poor service, 5) No female provider, 6) Husband/family didn’t allow, 7) Not necessary, 8) Not customary. Multivariable regression methods were used for measuring the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both countries a large proportion of the women mentioned facility delivery as not necessary, 54.9% (52.3–57.9) in Nigeria and 45.4% (42.0–47.5) in Ethiopia. Significant urban-rural variations were observed in the prevalence of the self-reported causes of non-utilisation. Women in the rural areas are more likely to report delivering at health facility as not customary/not necessary and healthy facility too far/no transport. However, urban women were more likely to complain that husband/family did not allow and that the costs were too high.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Women in the rural were more likely to regard facility delivery as unnecessary and complain about transportation and financial difficulties. In order to achieving the maternal mortality related targets, addressing regional disparities in accessing maternal healthcare services should be regarded as a priority of health promotion programs in Nigeria and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</link><fingerprint>84b954f9</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Sanni Yaya</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

A pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-specific receptor, PAC1R, is coupled with multiple signal transduction pathways including stimulation of adenylate cyclase, phospholipase C and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2. PAC1R has been shown to exert its long-lasting and potent signals via β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2. However, the precise roles of the two β-arrestin isoforms in PACAP-PAC1R signaling remain unclear. Here we examined the interaction between the two β-arrestin isoforms and PAC1R, β-arrestin-dependent PAC1R subcellular localization and ERK1/2 activation. Upon PACAP stimulation, although PAC1R similarly interacted with β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 in HEK293T cells, the complex of PAC1R and β-arrestin2 was translocated from the cell surface into cytosol, but that of β-arrestin1 remained in the cell surface regions in HeLa cells and mouse primary cultured neurons. Silencing of β-arrestin2 blocked PACAP-induced PAC1R internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but silencing of β-arrestin1 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</link><fingerprint>baacc1f2</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yusuke Shintani</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yusuke Shintani, Atsuko Hayata-Takano, Keita Moriguchi, Takanobu Nakazawa, Yukio Ago, Atsushi Kasai, Kaoru Seiriki, Norihito Shintani, Hitoshi Hashimoto&lt;/p&gt;

These results show that β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2 exert differential actions on PAC1R internalization and PAC1R-dependent ERK1/2 activation, and suggest that the two β-arrestin isoforms may be involved in fine and precise tuning of the PAC1R signaling pathways.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42260:5785ab88</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</originId><title>β-Arrestin1 and 2 differentially regulate PACAP-induced PAC1 receptor signaling and trafficking</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196946</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;
Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</link><fingerprint>3962f85c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Xiaopeng Mu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt;, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt; for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHxJ8eSA7PU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006135</link><fingerprint>9d588526</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Aaron T.

Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395ac:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/768?rss=1</originId><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/768?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Materials Science, Physics</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/768.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/16&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 16&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524465276000</published><fingerprint>801c93de</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>H.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</link><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Chunhua Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;While there is strong evidence showing the survival advantage of elite athletes, much less is known about those engaged in mind sports such as chess. This study aimed to examine the overall as well as regional survival of International Chess Grandmasters (GMs) with a reference to the general population, and compare relative survival (RS) of GMs with that of Olympic medallists (OMs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Information on 1,208 GMs and 15,157 OMs, respectively, from 28 countries were extracted from the publicly available data sources. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival rates of the GMs. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to adjust the survival for region, year at risk, age at risk and sex, and to estimate the life expectancy of the GMs. The RS rate was computed by matching each GM or OM by year at risk, age at risk and sex to the life table of the country the individual represented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survival rates of GMs at 30 and 60 years since GM title achievement were 87% and 15%, respectively. The life expectancy of GMs at the age of 30 years (which is near the average age when they attained a GM title) was 53.6 ([95% CI]: 47.7–58.5) years, which is significantly greater than the overall weighted mean life expectancy of 45.9 years for the general population. Compared to Eastern Europe, GMs in North America (HR [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.29–0.88]) and Western Europe (HR [95% CI]: 0.53 [0.34–0.83]) had a longer lifespan. The RS analysis showed that both GMs and OMs had a significant survival advantage over the general population, and there was no statistically significant difference in the RS of GMs (RS [95% CI]: 1.14 [1.08–1.20]) compared to OMs: (RS [95% CI]: 1.09 [1.07–1.11]) at 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Elite chess players live longer than the general population and have a similar survival advantage to elite competitors in physical sports.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196938</link><fingerprint>a6f5d3b0</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>An Tran-Duy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by An Tran-Duy, David C.

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</link><fingerprint>12e415bb</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Shade T.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples).

That was after the Merck/Incyte failure of a combination of Keytruda and Incyte’s IDO (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/24/6795&quot;&gt;indole 2,3-dioxygenase&lt;/a&gt;) inhibitor. That mechanism was supposed to increase T-cell activity, but the trial showed it to have no effect on Keytruda’s efficacy at all. Earlier IDO trials had not gone well for other companies, but there had been hopes for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there were hopes for another inhibitor that Bristol-Myers Squibb had bought from Flexus (which is quite a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;tangled tale&lt;/a&gt; in itself). I wondered at the end of that last post if the Merck/Incyte failure meant that the BMS/Flexus effort was doomed as well – everyone who follows this area was wondering the same thing – but as some readers pointed out, the Flexus inhibitor did have a somewhat different mechanism of action, so there was at least a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch that. Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndyBiotech/status/990975230322585605&quot;&gt;Andy Biotech&lt;/a&gt; noticed (and posted on Twitter) that the two Phase III trials had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2018/04/30/bristol-myers-latest-to-drop-ido-studies-in-wake-of-incyte-failure/&quot;&gt;quietly been scrapped&lt;/a&gt; on clinicaltrials.gov. So I think we can say that (at least as currently configured) the excursion into IDO inhibitors has been a costly mistake. And remember, as is almost always the case in these things, that it didn’t look like it was going to be any such thing. IDO inhibition made sense in terms of what we knew about its biochemical pathway and the workings of T-cells, which is why you saw several companies taking a whack at it (Pfizer was in the area as well, and there are others whose preclinical programs you never even heard about). All in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a great big central problem of drug discovery for you: how do we go into the clinic (but avoid spending Phase III levels of money) to find these things out? Better yet, how do we avoid developing such things in the first place, if they’re going to do this to us? Billions of dollars, literal billions, are stacked up waiting for anyone who can start to begin to do such things. Just to pick on a recent hyped-up press release, could BenevolentAI’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/23/benevolentai-worth-two-billion&quot;&gt;machine brain&lt;/a&gt;” have warned people off? Would anyone have believed them if they had? (I doubt that very much, for both questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the problem is that we’re doing things that no one has tried to do before, and we’re doing them on what is clearly incomplete information. And the only way to make it more complete is to. . .go ahead and do those things,apparently, and at great cost. Could you have warned everyone, in convincing fashion, not to chase IDO inhibitors? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/11/06/cb1_obesity_drugs_farewell_to_the_whole_lot&quot;&gt;CB1 antagonists&lt;/a&gt; for obesity? Cathepsin K &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/30/cathepsin-k-a-promising-target-fades-out&quot;&gt;inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;? Anti-amyloid &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/05/09/there-are-failures-you-know&quot;&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;? Mixed &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/07/11/the_last_ppar_compound&quot;&gt;PPAR ligands&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/27/hold-on-mercks-cetp-inhibitor-actually-works&quot;&gt;CETP&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2005/08/25/the_painful_history_of_substance_p&quot;&gt;Substance P&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors? Gamma-secretase &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/03/09/gammasecretase_inhibitors_the_wrong_way_around&quot;&gt;inhibitors&lt;/a&gt;? And I’m just picking ones off the top of my head that had multiple large research organizations working on them – there are plenty more where that came from, especially if you just bring in the targets that were disastrous for just one or two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these looked like worthwhile ideas at one point, and uncounted sums of money were spent on them (money from sales of other drugs to other customers and directly from investors). All of it could have been put to better use, but could you have done better? Sent people into areas that were less likely to fail, or found out that these mechanisms had something wrong with them without all the time, effort, and money? &lt;em&gt;Come on down and try it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13502</link><published>1525177507000</published><fingerprint>2d229e54</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>We have the answer to a question posed here earlier this month.

State-of-the-art light-sheet and confocal microscopes allow recording of entire embryos in 3D and over time (3D+t) for many hours. Fluorescently labeled structures can be segmented and tracked automatically in these terabyte-scale 3D+t images, resulting in thousands of cell migration trajectories that provide detailed insights to large-scale tissue reorganization at the cellular level. Here we present EmbryoMiner, a new interactive open-source framework suitable for in-depth analyses and comparisons of entire embryos, including an extensive set of trajectory features. Starting at the whole-embryo level, the framework can be used to iteratively focus on a region of interest within the embryo, to investigate and test specific trajectory-based hypotheses and to extract quantitative features from the isolated trajectories. Thus, the new framework provides a valuable new way to quantitatively compare corresponding anatomical regions in different embryos that were manually selected based on biological prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 3D+t light-sheet microscopy images of zebrafish embryos, showcasing potential user applications that can be performed using the new framework.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fPwmNSZz3xw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><published>1524171600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006128</link><fingerprint>458589a7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Benjamin Schott</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Schott, Manuel Traub, Cornelia Schlagenhauf, Masanari Takamiya, Thomas Antritter, Andreas Bartschat, Katharina Löffler, Denis Blessing, Jens C.

The forces driving the accumulation and removal of non-coding DNA and ultimately the evolution of genome size in complex organisms are intimately linked to genome structure and organisation. Our analysis provides a novel method for capturing the regional variation of lineage-specific DNA gain and loss events in their respective genomic contexts. To further understand this connection we used comparative genomics to identify genome-wide individual DNA gain and loss events in the human and mouse genomes. Focusing on the distribution of DNA gains and losses, relationships to important structural features and potential impact on biological processes, we found that in autosomes, DNA gains and losses both followed separate lineage-specific accumulation patterns. However, in both species chromosome X was particularly enriched for DNA gain, consistent with its high L1 retrotransposon content required for X inactivation. We found that DNA loss was associated with gene-rich open chromatin regions and DNA gain events with gene-poor closed chromatin regions. Additionally, we found that DNA loss events tended to be smaller than DNA gain events suggesting that they were able to accumulate in gene-rich open chromatin regions due to their reduced capacity to interrupt gene regulatory architecture. GO term enrichment showed that mouse loss hotspots were strongly enriched for terms related to developmental processes. However, these genes were also located in regions with a high density of conserved elements, suggesting that despite high levels of DNA loss, gene regulatory architecture remained conserved. This is consistent with a model in which DNA gain and loss results in turnover or “churning” in regulatory element dense regions of open chromatin, where interruption of regulatory elements is selected against.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1rMm4y09CQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006091</link><fingerprint>e975cac8</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Reuben M.

Because stability is far from assured for any individual hit list, GOTrack can lead to more informed and cautious application of GO to genomics research.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><crawled>1526270827971</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635cd49dc3:2d68bc3:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320861v1?rss=1</originId><title>Monitoring changes in the Gene Ontology and their impact on genomic data analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>1</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/320861v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/13/320861</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &amp;lt;i&gt;Brassica&amp;lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25585-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/99PqeoEiT_c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><fingerprint>168e2efd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Chang-Kug Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &amp;lt;i&gt;Brassica&amp;lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25585-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Re-exploration of U’s Triangle &lt;i&gt;Brassica&lt;/i&gt; Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/99PqeoEiT_c&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><crawled>1525857424276</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16344309394:9a540d:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4</href></item></canonical><title>Re-exploration of U’s Triangle Brassica Species Based on Chloroplast Genomes and 45S nrDNA Sequences</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/99PqeoEiT_c/s41598-018-25585-4</href></item></alternate><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25585-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25585_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>337</height></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25585-4</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;
We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196593</link><fingerprint>ddcc047</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Tomasz Raducha</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPCs) are one potential stem cell source to generate functional hepatocytes or β-cells. However, human MAPCs have less plasticity than pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), as their ability to generate endodermal cells is not robust. Here we studied the role of 14 transcription factors (TFs) in reprogramming MAPCs to induced endodermal progenitor cells (iENDO cells), defined as cells that can be long-term expanded and differentiated to both hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. We demonstrated that 14 TF-iENDO cells can be expanded for at least 20 passages, differentiate spontaneously to hepatocyte-, endocrine pancreatic-, gut tube-like cells as well as endodermal tumor formation when grafted in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, iENDO cells can be differentiated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into hepatocyte- and endocrine pancreatic-like cells. However, the pluripotency TF &lt;i&gt;OCT4&lt;/i&gt;, which is not silenced in iENDO cells, may contribute to the incomplete differentiation to mature cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and to endodermal tumor formation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Nevertheless, the studies presented here provide evidence that reprogramming of adult stem cells to an endodermal intermediate progenitor, which can be expanded and differentiate to multiple endodermal cell types, might be a valid alternative for the use of PSCs for creation of endodermal cell types.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197046</link><fingerprint>f5bc41f2</fingerprint><engagementRate>159.0</engagementRate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rangarajan Sambathkumar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarajan Sambathkumar, Renate Akkerman, Sumitava Dastidar, Philip Roelandt, Manoj Kumar, Manmohan Bajaj, Ana Rita Mestre Rosa, Nicky Helsen, Veerle Vanslembrouck, Eric Kalo, Satish Khurana, Jos Laureys, Conny Gysemans, Marijke M.

&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O104:H4, a hybrid pathotype reported in a large 2011 foodborne outbreak in Germany, has not been detected in cattle feces. However, cattle harbor and shed in the feces other O104 serotypes, particularly O104:H7, which has been associated with sporadic cases of diarrhea in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the virulence potential of Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) O104:H7 isolated from feces of feedlot cattle using DNA microarray. Six strains of STEC O104:H7 isolated from cattle feces were analyzed using FDA-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; Identification (ECID) DNA microarray to determine their virulence profiles and compare them to the human strains (clinical) of O104:H7, STEC O104:H4 (German outbreak strain), and O104:H21 (milk-associated Montana outbreak strain). Scatter plots were generated from the array data to visualize the gene-level differences between bovine and human O104 strains, and Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were determined. Splits tree was generated to analyze relatedness between the strains. All O104:H7 strains, both bovine and human, similar to O104:H4 and O104:H21 outbreak strains were negative for intimin (&lt;i&gt;eae&lt;/i&gt;). The bovine strains were positive for Shiga toxin 1 subtype c (&lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;1c), enterohemolysin (&lt;i&gt;ehxA&lt;/i&gt;), tellurite resistance gene (&lt;i&gt;terD&lt;/i&gt;), IrgA homolog protein (&lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;), type 1 fimbriae (&lt;i&gt;fimH&lt;/i&gt;), and negative for genes that code for effector proteins of type III secretory system. The six cattle O104 strains were closely related (r = 0.86–0.98) to each other, except for a few differences in phage related and non-annotated genes. One of the human clinical O104:H7 strains (2011C-3665) was more closely related to the bovine O104:H7 strains (r = 0.81–0.85) than the other four human clinical O104:H7 strains (r = 0.75–0.79). Montana outbreak strain (O104:H21) was more closely related to four of the human clinical O104:H7 strains than the bovine O104:H7 strains. None of the bovine &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O104 strains carried genes characteristic of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O104:H4 German outbreak strain and unlike other human strains were also negative for Shiga toxin 2. Because cattle &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O104:H7 strains possess &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;1c and genes that code for enterohemolysin and a variety of adhesins, the serotype has the potential to be a diarrheagenic foodborne pathogen in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196490</link><fingerprint>7fc7b3fd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Pragathi B.

This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family.

This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children’s health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58–7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07–6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0–8 years old.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7af:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197274</originId><title>Pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children in Tianjin area, China</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197274</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197274</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to save the high seas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to save the high seas, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05079-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05079-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As the United Nations prepares a historic treaty to protect the oceans, scientists highlight what’s needed for success.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525849200000</published><fingerprint>4d3c1d52</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Olive Heffernan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to save the high seas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to save the high seas, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05079-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05079-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As the United Nations prepares a historic treaty to protect the oceans, scientists highlight what’s needed for success.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><crawled>1525864343590</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163449a2826:a97bd0:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05079-z</originId><title>How to save the high seas</title><engagement>376</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05079-z</href></item></alternate><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05079-z/d41586-018-05079-z_15735980.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05079-z</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Emerging two-dimensional ferromagnetism in silicene materials&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging two-dimensional ferromagnetism in silicene materials, Published online: 26 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04012-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04012-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Exploring the magnetism in 2D materials paves the way to low-dimensional spintronics.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</link><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yu Lan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical stability is a key feature in the regulation of structural scaffolding proteins and their functions. Despite the abundance of α-helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease, the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood. Talin and α-catenin are two key molecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. In this study, we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, polyprotein engineering, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM) to investigate unfolding of these proteins. SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α-helix bundles as well as α-catenin α-helix domains unfold through stable 3-helix intermediates. While the 5-helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable, a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3-helix state was revealed. Mechanically weaker 4-helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3-helix conformation. The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations. The disulfide clamp mutants, designed to protect the stable state, support the 3-helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups. As a result, multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α-catenin unfolding pathway were discovered. Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α-helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z2y475sR2a8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006126</link><fingerprint>91825fd0</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Vasyl V.

This study aimed to investigate whether there was any difference in eating pattern, abnormal eating behaviour, obesity and the number of food addiction symptoms according to food addiction presence. A total sample of 851 healthy subjects living in Ankara (n = 360 male, n = 491 female) aged 19–65 years were included in this cross-sectional survey. Data on demographic information, 24-hour dietary recalls, Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), and anthropometric measurements were collected through face-to-face interviews. Overall, 11.4% of participants were identified as “food addicted” (F: 13.0%; M: 9.2%). Subjects meeting criteria for ‘food addiction&apos; had higher body mass index (35.1% were obese and 3.1% were underweight), compared to subjects without food addiction (13.1% were obese and 10.2% were underweight) (p&amp;lt;0.05). Abnormal eating attitudes estimated with EAT-26 were determined as 45.5% in males, 37.5% in females and 40.2% in total, among subjects with food addiction. Daily energy, protein and fat intakes were significantly higher in food addicted females, compared to non-addicted females (p&amp;lt;0.05). Participants with food addiction reported significantly more problems with foods, which contain high amounts of fat and sugar, compared to the participants without food addiction. Food addiction behaviour should be considered as a part of efforts towards reducing food related problems involving obesity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195541</link><fingerprint>4c9f91ef</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Aylin Ayaz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aylin Ayaz, Reyhan Nergiz-Unal, Damla Dedebayraktar, Asli Akyol, A.

Data on demographic information, 24-hour dietary recalls, Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), and anthropometric measurements were collected through face-to-face interviews. Overall, 11.4% of participants were identified as “food addicted” (F: 13.0%; M: 9.2%). Subjects meeting criteria for ‘food addiction&apos; had higher body mass index (35.1% were obese and 3.1% were underweight), compared to subjects without food addiction (13.1% were obese and 10.2% were underweight) (p&amp;lt;0.05). Abnormal eating attitudes estimated with EAT-26 were determined as 45.5% in males, 37.5% in females and 40.2% in total, among subjects with food addiction. Daily energy, protein and fat intakes were significantly higher in food addicted females, compared to non-addicted females (p&amp;lt;0.05). Participants with food addiction reported significantly more problems with foods, which contain high amounts of fat and sugar, compared to the participants without food addiction. Food addiction behaviour should be considered as a part of efforts towards reducing food related problems involving obesity.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f5:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195541</originId><title>How does food addiction influence dietary intake profile?</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195541</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195541</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Itziar Irurzun-Arana, Alvaro Janda, Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano, Iñaki F.

Numerous problems encountered in computational biology can be formulated as optimization problems. In this context, optimization of drug release characteristics or dosing schedules for anticancer agents has become a prominent area not only for the development of new drugs, but also for established drugs. However, in complex systems, optimization of drug exposure is not a trivial task and cannot be efficiently addressed through trial-error simulation exercises. Finding a solution to those problems is a challenging task which requires more advanced strategies like optimal control theory. In this work, we perform an optimal control analysis on a previously developed computational model for the testosterone effects of triptorelin in prostate cancer patients with the goal of finding optimal drug-release characteristics. We demonstrate how numerical control optimization of non-linear models can be used to find better therapeutic approaches in order to improve the final outcome of the patients.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8wx1FdaORT0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524171600000</updated><published>1524171600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006087</link><fingerprint>7f8ff863</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Itziar Irurzun-Arana</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Itziar Irurzun-Arana, Alvaro Janda, Sergio Ardanza-Trevijano, Iñaki F.

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study is aimed to evaluate the physiochemical properties and cytotoxicity of mercury-based formulation for the development of anticancer therapeuticals.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological features of the formulation were characterized by FE-SEM, XPS and EDS. The described formulation was evaluated for its cytotoxicity on Hek293 and MCF7 cell lines using MTT assay to study the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity was also studied on zebrafish embryos and the lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated as per the OECD regulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of mercuric compounds. The particles were spherical and stable with the size ranges between 20 and 80nm. Although the PK formulation contains mercurials it was very effective only to cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293). The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of developmental toxicity on zebrafish embryo confirmed the safer dosage of 100μg/ml. However, a higher dosage of 1mg/ml led to the malformation of embryos such as pericardial, tail and yolk sac edema.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The physiochemical characterization of PK formulation confirmed the presence of HgS. The results of both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that the formulation is less toxic. Although the test sample contains mercurials it was very effective against cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293).&lt;/p&gt; Future studies &lt;p&gt;Further studies on effectiveness of the formulation along with inflammatory response in mice models are to be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195800</link><fingerprint>302da19</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Kannan N</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kannan N, Shanmuga Sundar S, Balaji S, Arul Amuthan, Anil Kumar NV, Balasubramanian N&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

The psychometric properties of the ten-item Kessler Psychological Distress scale (K10) have been extensively explored in civilian populations. However, documentation of its psychometric properties in military populations is limited, and there is no universally accepted cut-off score on the K10 to distinguish clinical vs. sub-clinical levels of distress. The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the K10 in Canadian Armed Forces personnel. Data on 6700 Regular Forces personnel were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey. The internal consistency and factor structure of the K10 (range, 0–40) were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach’s alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05–0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196562</link><fingerprint>c1e8930f</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Hugues Sampasa-Kanyinga</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hugues Sampasa-Kanyinga, Mark A.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select optimal cut-offs for the K10, using the presence/absence of any of four past-month disorders as the outcome (posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder). Cronbach’s alpha (0.88) indicated a high level of internal consistency of the K10. Results from CFA indicated that a single-factor 10-item construct had an acceptable overall fit: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05; 90% confidence interval (CI):0.05–0.06, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.99, Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) = 0.99, weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) = 2.06. K10 scores were strongly associated with both the presence and recency of all four measured disorders. The area under the ROC curve was 0.92, demonstrating excellent predictive value for past-30-day disorders. A K10 score of 10 or greater was optimal for screening purposes (sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 83%), while a score of 17 or greater (sensitivity = 53%; specificity = 97%) was optimal for prevalence estimation of clinically significant psychological distress, in that it resulted in equal numbers of false positives and false negatives. Our results suggest that K10 scale has satisfactory psychometric properties for use as a measure of non-specific psychological distress in the military population.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7b:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196562</originId><title>The psychometric properties of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) in Canadian military personnel</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196562</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196562</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Pyridoxine dipharmacophore derivatives as potent glucokinase activators for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Pyridoxine dipharmacophore derivatives as potent glucokinase activators for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Published online: 19 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24838-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24838-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Pyridoxine dipharmacophore derivatives as potent glucokinase activators for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/WzTW-P_xiLc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524121200000</published><fingerprint>e45c6ab7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Mikhail S.

GABA is a robust regulator of both developing and mature neural networks. It exerts many of its effects through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, which are heteropentamers assembled from a large array of subunits encoded by distinct genes. In mammals, there are 19 different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit types, which are divided into the α, β, γ, δ, ε, π, θ and ρ subfamilies. The immense diversity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors is not fully understood. However, it is known that specific isoforms, with their distinct biophysical properties and expression profiles, tune responses to GABA. Although larval zebrafish are well-established as a model system for neural circuit analysis, little is known about GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diversity and expression in this system. Here, using database analysis, we show that the zebrafish genome contains at least 23 subunits. All but the mammalian θ and ε subunits have at least one zebrafish ortholog, while five mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunits have two zebrafish orthologs. Zebrafish contain one subunit, β4, which does not have a clear mammalian ortholog. Similar to mammalian GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the zebrafish α subfamily is the largest and most diverse of the subfamilies. In zebrafish there are eight α subunits, and RNA &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization across early zebrafish development revealed that they demonstrate distinct patterns of expression in the brain, spinal cord, and retina. Some subunits were very broadly distributed, whereas others were restricted to small populations of cells. Subunit-specific expression patterns in zebrafish resembled were those found in frogs and rodents, which suggests that the roles of different GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor isoforms are largely conserved among vertebrates. This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</link><fingerprint>2cea1d92</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Bryan Monesson-Olson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bryan Monesson-Olson, Jon J.

This study provides a platform to examine isoform specific roles of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors within zebrafish neural circuits and it highlights the potential of this system to better understand the remarkable heterogeneity of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73b:fc1f8953</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</originId><title>Expression of the eight GABA&amp;lt;sub&gt;A&amp;lt;/sub&gt; receptor α subunits in the developing zebrafish central nervous system</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196083</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;
Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</link><fingerprint>34d1490d</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Vicente Botella-Soler</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Magnetic seismology of interstellar gas clouds: Unveiling a hidden dimension</title><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d808:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/635?rss=1</originId><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><engagement>12</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/635?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Astronomy, Physics</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/635.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH. Clinicians should pay specific attention and carefully evaluate the possibility of primary SS in patients with PAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><published>1526418000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197297</link><fingerprint>fc27df4</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Tatsuyuki Sato</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuyuki Sato, Masaru Hatano, Yukiko Iwasaki, Hisataka Maki, Akihito Saito, Shun Minatsuki, Toshiro Inaba, Eisuke Amiya, Keishi Fujio, Masafumi Watanabe, Kazuhiko Yamamoto, Issei Komuro&lt;/p&gt;

The vertebrate neuroepithelium is composed of elongated progenitors whose reciprocal attachments ensure the continuity of the ventricular wall. As progenitors commit to differentiation, they translocate their nucleus basally and eventually withdraw their apical endfoot from the ventricular surface. However, the mechanisms allowing this delamination process to take place while preserving the integrity of the neuroepithelial tissue are still unclear. Here, we show that Notch signaling, which is classically associated with an undifferentiated state, remains active in prospective neurons until they delaminate. During this transition period, prospective neurons rapidly reduce their apical surface and only later down-regulate N-Cadherin levels. Upon Notch blockade, nascent neurons disassemble their junctions but fail to reduce their apical surface. This disrupted sequence weakens the junctional network and eventually leads to breaches in the ventricular wall. We also provide evidence that the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) promotes differentiation by reducing Notch signaling through a &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition mechanism. However, during the delamination process, the ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb1 (Mib1) transiently blocks this &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition and sustains Notch activity to defer differentiation. We propose that the fine-tuned balance between Notch &lt;i&gt;Trans&lt;/i&gt;-activation and &lt;i&gt;Cis&lt;/i&gt;-inhibition allows neuroepithelial cells to seamlessly delaminate from the ventricular wall as they commit to differentiation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OBYDT1hFD-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004162</link><fingerprint>f39f2dd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Chooyoung Baek</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chooyoung Baek, Lucy Freem, Rosette Goïame, Helen Sang, Xavier Morin, Samuel Tozer&lt;/p&gt;

The biological properties of essential oils have been demonstrated in the treatment of several diseases and to enhance the bioavailability of other drugs. In natural habitats the essential oils compounds may play important roles in the protection of the plants as antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals, insecticides and also against herbivores by reducing their appetite for such plants or by repelling undesirable others.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation and prognosis of adult and elderly patients with IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) accompanied by nephritis (IgAV-N) have not been investigated in detail.

Both groups had favorable renal survival rates for nine years (93.6% and 91.4% of the adult and elderly patients, respectively). Significantly more elderly than adult patients developed a 50% increase in sCr during a mean observation period of 3.9 years (21.7% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.012), and significantly fewer elderly, than adult patients achieved clinical remission (23.9% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.016).

Now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/abstract/S2211-1247(18)30307-3&quot;&gt;here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of protein fuzziness, and I can’t say that I’d like to take this one on, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcn4&quot;&gt;Gcn4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MED15&quot;&gt;Med15&lt;/a&gt; are important parts of the the transcriptional machinery in yeast, and this system has many similarities to what’s going on in higher organisms. Gcn4 is a transcription activator, found in large protein complexes where genes are being transcribed, and it has two (disordered) activation domains that recruit all sorts of co-activator proteins. As the paper says, this has long been seen as a case of “acidic blobs” (Gcn4 in this case) and “negative noodles” (proteins like Med15, SAGA, Swi/Snf and many others). Those charge interactions make sense, but not much else does, and the big question has been how these complexes form with any specificity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also been clear, though, that you really need a cloud of these things for transcription. No one single activator-coactivator event is enough. The back half of Med15, for example, has at least three binding domains that can interact with Gcn4, and this sort of multivalency is common. That makes it quite hard to unravel what’s going on in the protein complex, of course. What kind of structure do you have in there? Many of the protein binding regions involved are disordered in the absence of a binding partner, but it’s well known that some of these can form up into very well-defined structures when they encounter each other. Is that what’s happening on a larger scale? Or is it like the situation described in that first paragraph link, where two disordered proteins form a tight interaction &lt;em&gt;while both still remaining disordered&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not quite that latter case, but it’s still disconcerting. This new paper shows that the various protein interaction domains all have low affinity individually (as the more reductionist experiments had shown), and they do not really assemble into something concrete:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div title=&quot;Page 3&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our data demonstrate that the presence of multiple binding components leads to a large gain in the affinity of Gcn4-Med15 binding but does not lead to formation of a distinct ordered structure. The functional complex is a dynamic fuzzy ‘‘free-for-all”. . .Our results provide a general model for the mechanism of many activators that functionally bind coactivators with multiple ABDs and demonstrate how multiple weak fuzzy interactions synergize to generate a biologically functional and specific interaction without adopting a unique protein-protein interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh dear. “Dynamic fuzzy free-for-all” is not the kind of environment that I really feel comfortable tossing small molecules into, but I didn’t get any input into this process. Both of the Gcn4 activator domains bind to all of the Med15 activator-binding domains. A lot of fluorescence polarization work, calorimetry, and NMR data establish that Gcn4’s activator domains do indeed take on helical structure when they’re in the presence of a corresponding Med15 domain, but it’s not that this structure is the nailed-down form of the complex. It can, and does, form the exact same sorts of structures with all the others, and there are several ways that the helices (and the proteins in general) can interact. They’re just bumping around in there sampling every possibility, and the sum of those things is (from a distance) a high-affinity, well-defined protein complex. It’s only as you zoom in closer that you realize that it looks more like a live swarm of bees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, not all transcription activators work this way. There are examples known with specific, defined protein-protein interfaces, more the sort of thing we’re used to. But there are also many cases where a single activator seems to pick up a whole list of (seemingly unrelated) partners, and in those cases, this fuzzy combinatorial mechanism could well be the mode of operation. But for a drug discovery guy like me, the next question, behind the scientific curiosity one, is: is there any way we can target or alter these mechanisms to treat disease? Just figuring out which ones you’d want to target is a major job, and figuring out what sort of alteration you’d want is another. But the biggest job of all is at the end: once you’ve found the spot, and you know what you’d like to do, how do you make one of these fuzzballs do what you want? At the moment, I have no idea. But the night is young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses. Our data indicates that restraint stressor can have significant effects on pathogen-induced colonic inflammation and suggest that stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, microbial-produced SCFAs and their receptors may be involved.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196961</link><fingerprint>feeb144f</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Ross M.

The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject’s processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an “alternate answer” strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test’s demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures.

The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) is widely used to evaluate processing speed and executive function in patients with multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and other neurological disorders. In the PASAT, subjects listen to sequences of digits while continuously reporting the sum of the last two digits presented. Four different stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) are usually tested, with difficulty increasing as SOAs are reduced. Ceiling effects are common at long SOAs, while the digit delivery rate often exceeds the subject’s processing capacity at short SOAs, causing some subjects to stop performing altogether. In addition, subjects may adopt an “alternate answer” strategy at short SOAs, which reduces the test’s demands on working-memory and processing speed. Consequently, studies have shown that the number of dyads (consecutive correct answers) is a more sensitive measure of PASAT performance than the overall number of correct sums. Here, we describe a 2.5-minute computerized test, the Dyad-Adaptive PASAT (DA-PASAT), where SOAs are adjusted with a 2:1 staircase, decreasing after each pair of correct responses and increasing after misses. Processing capacity is reflected in the minimum SOA (minSOA) achieved in 54 trials. Experiment 1 gathered normative data in two large populations: 1617 subjects in New Zealand ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, and 214 Californians ranging in age from 18 to 82 years. Minimum SOAs were influenced by age, education, and daily hours of computer-use. Minimum SOA z-scores, calculated after factoring out the influence of these factors, were virtually identical in the two control groups, as were response times (RTs) and dyad ratios (the proportion of hits occurring in dyads). Experiment 2 measured the test-retest reliability of the DA-PASAT in 44 young subjects who underwent three test sessions at weekly intervals. High intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were found for minSOAs (0.87), response times (0.76), and dyad ratios (0.87). Performance improved across test sessions for all measures. Experiment 3 investigated the effects of simulated malingering in 50 subjects: 42% of simulated malingerers produced abnormal (p&amp;lt; 0.05) minSOA z-scores. Simulated malingerers with abnormal scores were distinguished with 87% sensitivity and 69% specificity from control subjects with abnormal scores by excessive differences between training performance and the actual test. Experiment 4 investigated patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI): patients with mild TBI performed within the normal range while patients with severe TBI showed deficits. The DA-PASAT reduces the time and stress of PASAT assessment while gathering sensitive measures of dyad processing that reveal the effects of aging, malingering, and traumatic brain injury on performance.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ea:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0178148</originId><title>The Dyad-Adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (DA-PASAT): Normative data and the effects of repeated testing, simulated malingering, and traumatic brain injury</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0178148</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0178148</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><published>1523998800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</link><fingerprint>1ceb0ce8</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Toru Maekawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

Both studies demonstrated significant reductions of overweight and obesity among children. Members of the steering committees were asked to complete a retrospective social network questionnaire using a roster of other committee members and free recall.

Higher FGF-23 was associated with all-cause mortality in adjusted models (HR 1.6 (1.1–2.2); p = 0.011) with a rIDI of 30% (p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In patients with T2D and microalbuminuria, higher GDF-15 and FGF-23 were independently associated with all-cause mortality and higher GDF-15 improved risk prediction of decline in kidney function and higher FGF-23 of all-cause mortality, beyond traditional risk factors, but not independently of GDF-15.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524765422632</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbf:11c251fd</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196634</originId><title>Growth differentiation factor-15 and fibroblast growth factor-23 are associated with mortality in type 2 diabetes – An observational follow-up study</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196634</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196634</canonicalUrl></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/264?rss=1</link><published>1524159423000</published><fingerprint>503e4ed7</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/264?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>LLorca, J.</name></author><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162df0c1301:449d6c2:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>On the quest for the strongest materials</title><engagement>57</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/264?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/264.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>Understanding the function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) requires detailed knowledge of the structure of its primary protein, apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1).

The stress-induced mutagenesis hypothesis postulates that in response to stress, bacteria increase their genome-wide mutation rate, in turn increasing the chances that a descendant is able to better withstand the stress. This has implications for antibiotic treatment: exposure to subinhibitory doses of antibiotics has been reported to increase bacterial mutation rates and thus probably the rate at which resistance mutations appear and lead to treatment failure. More generally, the hypothesis posits that stress increases evolvability (the ability of a population to generate adaptive genetic diversity) and thus accelerates evolution. Measuring mutation rates under stress, however, is problematic, because existing methods assume there is no death. Yet subinhibitory stress levels may induce a substantial death rate. Death events need to be compensated by extra replication to reach a given population size, thus providing more opportunities to acquire mutations. We show that ignoring death leads to a systematic overestimation of mutation rates under stress. We developed a system based on plasmid segregation that allows us to measure death and division rates simultaneously in bacterial populations. Using this system, we found that a substantial death rate occurs at the tested subinhibitory concentrations previously reported to increase mutation rate. Taking this death rate into account lowers and sometimes removes the signal for stress-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, even when antibiotics increase mutation rate, we show that subinhibitory treatments do not increase genetic diversity and evolvability, again because of effects of the antibiotics on population dynamics. We conclude that antibiotic-induced mutagenesis is overestimated because of death and that understanding evolvability under stress requires accounting for the effects of stress on population dynamics as much as on mutation rate. Our goal here is dual: we show that population dynamics and, in particular, the numbers of cell division are crucial but neglected parameters in the evolvability of a population, and we provide experimental and computational tools and methods to study evolvability under stress, leading to a reassessment of the magnitude and significance of the stress-induced mutagenesis paradigm.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YW43eur48VA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005056</link><fingerprint>bf4c7cd1</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Antoine Frenoy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Frenoy, Sebastian Bonhoeffer&lt;/p&gt;

A two-phase feeding study evaluating performance of rainbow trout and comparing luminal and mucosal gastrointestinal tract (GIT) bacterial community compositions when fed two alternative protein diets in two rearing systems was conducted. Alternative protein diets (animal protein and plant protein diets) balanced with crystalline amino acids: lysine, methionine and threonine or unbalanced, were fed to rainbow trout in two separate water systems (recirculating (RR) and flow-through (FF)) for a period of 16 weeks. The four diets, each contained 38% digestible protein and 20% fats, were fed to rainbow trout with an average weight of 12.02 ± 0.61 g, and sorted at 30 fish/tank and 12 tanks per dietary treatment. Phase 1 lasted for 8 weeks after which fish from each tank were randomly divided, with one-half moved to new tanks of the opposing system (i.e. from RR to FF and vice versa). The remaining halves were retained in their initial tank and system, and fed their original diets for another 8 weeks (phase 2). After the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; week, 3 fish/tank were sampled for each of proximate analysis, body indexes and 16S rRNA analysis of GIT microbiota. Fish weight (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0030, P&amp;lt;0.0010) and body fat (P = 0.0008, P = 0.0041, P = 0.0177) were significantly affected by diet, diet quality (balanced or unbalanced) and system, respectively. Feed intake (P = 0.0008) and body energy (P&amp;lt;0.0010) were altered by system. Body indexes were not affected by dietary treatment and water systems. Compositional dissimilarities existed between samples from the rearing water and GIT locations (ANOSIM: (R = 0.29, P = 0.0010), PERMANOVA: R = 0.39, P = 0.0010), but not in dietary samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.004, P = 0.3140, PERMANOVA: R = 0.008, P = 0.4540). Bacteria were predominantly from the phyla &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;. Their abundance differed with more dissimilarity in the luminal samples (ANOSIM: R = 0.40, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.56, P = 0.0010) than those from the mucosal intestine (ANOSIM: R = 0.37, P = 0.0010, PERMANOVA: R = 0.41, P = 0.0010). Bacteria generally associated with carbohydrate and certain amino acids metabolism were observed in the mucosal intestine while rearing water appeared to serve as the main route of colonization of &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/i&gt; in the rainbow trout.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523998800000</updated><published>1523998800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195967</link><fingerprint>e518f13e</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Omolola C.

Bacteria generally associated with carbohydrate and certain amino acids metabolism were observed in the mucosal intestine while rearing water appeared to serve as the main route of colonization of &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/i&gt; in the rainbow trout.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415d:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195967</originId><title>Water system is a controlling variable modulating bacterial diversity of gastrointestinal tract and performance in rainbow trout</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195967</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195967</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by KiHoon Sung, Young Eun Choi&lt;/p&gt;
Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiotherapy, which delivers an ablative high radiation dose to a target volume for maximum local tumor control, requires a rapid dose fall-off outside the target volume to prevent extensive damage to nearby normal tissue. Currently, there is no tool to comprehensively evaluate the dose gradient near the target volume. We propose the dose gradient curve (DGC) as a new tool to evaluate the quality of a treatment plan with respect to the dose fall-off characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The average distance between two isodose surfaces was represented by the dose gradient index (DGI) estimated by a simple equation using the volume and surface area of isodose levels. The surface area was calculated by mesh generation and surface triangulation. The DGC was defined as a plot of the DGI of each dose interval as a function of the dose. Two types of DGCs, &lt;i&gt;differential&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cumulative&lt;/i&gt;, were generated. The performance of the DGC was evaluated using stereotactic radiosurgery plans for virtual targets.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Over the range of dose distributions, the dose gradient of each dose interval was well-characterized by the DGC in an easily understandable graph format. Significant changes in the DGC were observed reflecting the differences in planning situations and various prescription doses.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The DGC is a rational method for visualizing the dose gradient as the average distance between two isodose surfaces; the shorter the distance, the steeper the dose gradient.

Disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, intracellular reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis and methylation, likely increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, results have been inconsistent. To explore whether this inconsistency could be explained by intertumoral heterogeneity, we evaluated a comprehensive panel of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to the risk of molecular subtypes of CRC defined by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; oncogenes. This nested case-control study included 488 CRC cases and 947 matched controls from two population-based cohorts in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. We analyzed 14 biomarkers and 17 SNPs in prediagnostic blood and determined &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; mutation status in tumor tissue. In a multivariate network analysis, no variable displayed a strong association with the risk of specific CRC subtypes. A non-synonymous SNP in the &lt;i&gt;CTH&lt;/i&gt; gene, rs1021737, had a stronger association compared with other variables. In subsequent univariate analyses, participants with variant rs1021737 genotype had a decreased risk of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.50, 1.05), and an increased risk of &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt;-mutated CRC (OR per allele = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.07, 2.30), with weak evidence for heterogeneity (P&lt;sub&gt;heterogeneity&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01). This subtype-specific SNP association was not replicated in a case-case analysis of 533 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (P = 0.85). In conclusion, we found no support for clear subtype-specific roles of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers and SNPs in CRC development, making differences in CRC molecular subtype distributions an unlikely explanation for the varying results on the role of one-carbon metabolism in CRC development across previous studies.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><published>1526418000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</link><fingerprint>6589785</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yui K.

When core body temperature increases, appetite and food consumption decline. A higher core body temperature can occur during exercise, during exposure to warm environmental temperatures, or during a fever, yet the mechanisms that link relatively warm temperatures to appetite suppression are unknown. A recent study in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates that neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neural population well known to suppress food intake, also express a temperature-sensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Slight increases in body temperature cause a TRPV1-dependent increase in activity in POMC neurons, which suppresses feeding in mice. Taken together, this study suggests a novel mechanism linking body temperature and food-seeking behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1bk6Jjx1vEo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006188</link><fingerprint>601d8830</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Maria A.

To communicate effectively animals need to detect temporal vocalization cues that vary over several orders of magnitude in their amplitude and frequency content. This large range of temporal cues is evident in the power-law scale-invariant relationship between the power of temporal fluctuations in sounds and the sound modulation frequency (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;). Though various forms of scale invariance have been described for natural sounds, the origins and implications of scale invariant phenomenon remain unknown. Using animal vocalization sequences, including continuous human speech, and a stochastic model of temporal amplitude fluctuations we demonstrate that temporal acoustic edges are the primary acoustic cue accounting for the scale invariant phenomenon. The modulation spectrum of vocalization sequences and the model both exhibit a dual regime lowpass structure with a flat region at low modulation frequencies and scale invariant 1/&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; trend for high modulation frequencies. Moreover, we find a time-frequency tradeoff between the average vocalization duration of each vocalization sequence and the cutoff frequency beyond which scale invariant behavior is observed. These results indicate that temporal edges are universal features responsible for scale invariance in vocalized sounds. This is significant since temporal acoustic edges are salient perceptually and the auditory system could exploit such statistical regularities to minimize redundancies and generate compact neural representations of vocalized sounds.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bhrtKDTjYVA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005996</link><fingerprint>de455e9e</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Fatemeh Khatami</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fatemeh Khatami, Markus Wöhr, Heather L.

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006114</link><fingerprint>bc7400d5</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>William Marshall</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

We showcased the versatility of our workflow using different instrument platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological sample types and demonstrated that over 2,000 metabolites could be identified from one experiment.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><crawled>1524512258736</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162f402fab0:615b9f3:34f43e70</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305201v1?rss=1</originId><title>Metabolic Reaction Network-based Recursive Metabolite Identification for Untargeted Metabolomics [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305201v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/23/305201</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physicists in Earth’s remotest corners race to reproduce ‘cosmic dawn’ signal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists in Earth’s remotest corners race to reproduce ‘cosmic dawn’ signal, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04966-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04966-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Teams rush to capture radiation from Universe’s first stars and to explain puzzling observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524812400000</published><fingerprint>d29f9c4e</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Davide Castelvecchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physicists in Earth’s remotest corners race to reproduce ‘cosmic dawn’ signal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists in Earth’s remotest corners race to reproduce ‘cosmic dawn’ signal, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04966-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04966-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Teams rush to capture radiation from Universe’s first stars and to explain puzzling observations.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><crawled>1524825416299</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16306ad626b:8df3a7:4e164c41</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04966-9</originId><title>Physicists in Earth’s remotest corners race to reproduce ‘cosmic dawn’ signal</title><engagement>170</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04966-9</href></item></alternate><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04966-9/d41586-018-04966-9_15717570.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height></visual><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04966-9</link></item><item><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526016255000</published><fingerprint>604d10b7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Pavlos S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status. The HMR program could be an effective strategy to prevent costly diabetes and cardiovascular events, particularly in high risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195794</link><fingerprint>ea771b4c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Linda Gotthelf</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Gotthelf, Ya-Ting Chen, Srinivasan Rajagopalan, Elise Chi-Tao Wu, Ishita Doshi, Carol Addy&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10.&lt;/p&gt; Results and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTD&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.05)). The primary finding in Study 2, however, suggests that introducing NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; repeatedly during a 10-week RT program does not confer any additional benefit to the mechanisms (and subsequent adaptive processes) related to explosive power production.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196677</link><fingerprint>be286cfc</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jason C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) urgently requires effective treatment. Bleomycin-induced lung injury models are characterized by initial inflammation and secondary fibrosis, consistent with the pathological features of IPF. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) exhibit good differentiation potential and paracrine activity and are thus ideal for cell-based clinical therapies. The therapeutic effects of hAECs on lung fibrosis are attributed to many factors. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with hAECs to provide suggestions for their clinical use.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original studies describing hAEC therapy in animal bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. After quality assessments, the number and species of experimental animals, bleomycin dose, hAEC source and dosage, time and route of administration of transplanted cells in animals, and time animals were euthanized in nine controlled preclinical studies were summarized. Ashcroft scores, lung collagen contents, inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantitatively and/or qualitatively analyzed in this review. Publication bias was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the nine preclinical studies have unique characteristics regarding hAEC use. Ashcroft scores and lung collagen contents were decreased following hAEC transplantation in bleomycin-injured mice. Histopathology was also improved in most studies following treatment with hAECs. hAECs modulated macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells and the mRNA or protein levels of cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin) in lung tissues of bleomycin-injured mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;hAECs alleviate and reverse the progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice and may represent a new clinical treatment for IPF. hAECs exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by modulating macrophage, neutrophil, T cell, dendritic cell and related cytokine levels in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

Automatically estimating the number of clusters has been a challenging problem in Machine Learning. Using clustering algorithms together with internal cluster validity indexes have been a popular method of estimating the number of clusters in biomolecular data. We propose a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm, named SilHAC, which can automatically estimate the number of natural clusters and can find the associated clustering solution.

Automatically estimating the number of clusters has been a challenging problem in Machine Learning. Using clustering algorithms together with internal cluster validity indexes have been a popular method of estimating the number of clusters in biomolecular data. We propose a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering algorithm, named SilHAC, which can automatically estimate the number of natural clusters and can find the associated clustering solution. SilHAC is parameterless. We also present two hybrids of SilHAC with Spectral Clustering and K-Means respectively as components. SilHAC and the hybrids could find reasonable estimates for the number of clusters and the associated clustering solution when applied to a collection of cancer gene expression datasets. The proposed methods are better alternatives to the &apos;clustering algorithm - internal cluster validity index&apos; pipelines for estimating the number of natural clusters.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><crawled>1524853353190</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1630857aae6:c3f8e1:11c251fd</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309716v1?rss=1</originId><title>A Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Based on Silhouette Index for Cancer Subtype Discovery from Omics Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309716v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/27/309716</canonicalUrl></item><item><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36649</link><published>1524009600000</published><fingerprint>3567ba79</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>donald.vinh@mcgill.ca (Donald C Vinh)</name></author><description>A mutation in a transcription factor makes people susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Tropheryma whipplei&lt;/i&gt;, the bacterium that causes a rare condition called Whipple&apos;s disease.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><crawled>1524043626628</crawled><summary><content>A mutation in a transcription factor makes people susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Tropheryma whipplei&lt;/i&gt;, the bacterium that causes a rare condition called Whipple&apos;s disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162d8143884:385f777:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36649</originId><title>Back from the brink of obscurity</title><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36649</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Immunology and Inflammation</item><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36649</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concurrent micro- to macro-cardiac electrophysiology in myocyte cultures and human heart slices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concurrent micro- to macro-cardiac electrophysiology in myocyte cultures and human heart slices, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25170-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25170-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Concurrent micro- to macro-cardiac electrophysiology in myocyte cultures and human heart slices&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/HgpFyoWBYfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525244400000</published><fingerprint>6425cae2</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rasheda A.

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13515</link><published>1525699324000</published><fingerprint>7bf5bf9</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>This paper (from two groups at Yale’s chemistry department) addresses several important things that fall into the “important irritants” category in synthesis and molecular biology – or maybe that should be “irritatingly important”.

are more thermally stable than common Al hydride thin film precursors such as
AlH3(NMe3). ALD film growth experiments using TiCl4 and AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2) produced titanium carbonitride films with a high
growth rate of 1.6-2.0 Å/cycle and resistivities around 600 μΩ·cm within a very
wide ALD window of 220-400 °C. Importantly, film growth proceeded via
self-limited surface reactions, which is the hallmark of an ALD process. Root
mean square surface roughness was only 1.3 % of the film thickness at 300 °C by
atomic force microscopy. The films were polycrystalline with low intensity, broad
reflections corresponding to the cubic TiN/TiC phase according to grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction. Film composition by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy was approximately TiC0.8N0.5 at 300 °C with
small amounts of Al (6 at%), Cl (4 at%) and O (4 at%) impurities. Remarkably,
self-limited growth and low Al content was observed in films deposited well
above the solid-state thermal decomposition point of AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NMe2), which is ca. 185 °C. Similar growth rates,
resistivities, and film compositions were observed in ALD film growth trials
using AlH2(tBuNCH2CH2NC4H8).</description><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><crawled>1525356570436</crawled><summary><content>Aluminum dihydride complexes containing amido-amine

This study investigated &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; expression in the &lt;i&gt;pars tuberalis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) of the pituitary and medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH) of sheep, across seasons and reproductive states. It has recently been proposed that season impacts alternative splicing of &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in the PT, which shifts the balance between angiogenic VEGFAxxx and anti-angiogenic VEGFAxxxb isoforms (with xxx the number of amino acids of the mature VEGFA proteins) to modulate seasonal breeding. Here, we used various RT-PCR methodologies and analysis of RNAseq datasets to investigate seasonal variation in expression and splicing of the ovine &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; gene. Collectively, we identify 5 different transcripts for &lt;i&gt;Vegfa&lt;/i&gt; within the ewe PT/MBH, which correspond to splicing events previously described in mouse and human. All identified transcripts encode angiogenic VEGFAxxx isoforms, with no evidence for alternative splicing within exon 8. These findings led us to investigate in detail how “&lt;i&gt;Vegfaxxxb&lt;/i&gt;-like” PCR products could be generated by RT-PCR and misidentified as endogenous transcripts, in sheep and human HEK293 cells.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</link><fingerprint>56e4495e</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Lari Lehtovirta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><published>1524603600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</link><fingerprint>e142d5ce</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Alessandra Bisagni</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;

The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb0:34f43e70</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</originId><title>Higher expression of miR-133b is associated with better efficacy of erlotinib as the second or third line in non-small cell lung cancer patients</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196219</link><fingerprint>6db7e37c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>He-He Cao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196087</link><fingerprint>efe84cda</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Chengcheng Shao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chengcheng Shao, Pik-Mai Hui, Lei Wang, Xinwen Jiang, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer, Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Animal welfare requires the adequate housing of animals to ensure health and well-being. The application of environmental enrichment is a way to improve the well-being of laboratory animals. However, it is important to know whether these enrichment items can be incorporated in experimental mouse husbandry without creating a divide between past and future experimental results. Previous small-scale studies have been inconsistent throughout the literature, and it is not yet completely understood whether and how enrichment might endanger comparability of results of scientific experiments. Here, we measured the effect on means and variability of 164 physiological parameters in 3 conditions: with nesting material with or without a shelter, comparing these 2 conditions to a “barren” regime without any enrichments. We studied a total of 360 mice from each of 2 mouse strains (C57BL/6NTac and DBA/2NCrl) and both sexes for each of the 3 conditions. Our study indicates that enrichment affects the mean values of some of the 164 parameters with no consistent effects on variability. However, the influence of enrichment appears negligible compared to the effects of other influencing factors. Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005019</link><fingerprint>39fd180a</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Viola André</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola André, Christine Gau, Angelika Scheideler, Juan A.

Therefore, nesting material and shelters may be used to improve animal welfare without impairment of experimental outcome or loss of comparability to previous data collected under barren housing conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Dd6wtkaJG8Q&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><crawled>1523899106246</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf7703c6:e8c8c5:76251cdd</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005019</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005019</href></item></canonical><title>Laboratory mouse housing conditions can be improved using common environmental enrichment without compromising data</title><engagement>4</engagement><unread>False</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Dd6wtkaJG8Q/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1523899141771</recrawled></item><item><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/2018/jctcce.2018.14.issue-5/acs.jctc.7b01288/20180502/images/medium/ct-2017-012882_0007.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>277</height></visual><published>1523851200000</published><fingerprint>50954653</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Daniel R.

Distance between rows and plants are essential parameters that affect the final grain yield in row crops. This paper presents the results of research intended to develop a novel method to quantify the distance between maize plants at field scale using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Using this method, we can recognize maize plants as objects and calculate the distance between plants. We initially developed our method by training an algorithm in an indoor facility with plastic corn plants. Then, the method was scaled up and tested in a farmer’s field with maize plant spacing that exhibited natural variation. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to precisely quantify the distance between maize plants. We found that accuracy of the measurement of the distance between maize plants depended on the height above ground level at which UAV imagery was taken. This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195223</link><fingerprint>f0fe591b</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jinshui Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinshui Zhang, Bruno Basso, Richard F.

This study provides an innovative approach to quantify plant-to-plant variability and, thereby final crop yield estimates.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f2:7d6c1c1c</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195223</originId><title>Estimating plant distance in maize using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195223</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195223</canonicalUrl></item><item><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301078%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8389f9bbeaf1a53356b0e1451365fbae</link><published>1525881732000</published><fingerprint>7a2498c6</fingerprint><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301078%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8389f9bbeaf1a53356b0e1451365fbae</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;Available online 9 May 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): John Salamon, Xiaoyan Qian, Mats Nilsson, David John Lynn&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; sequencing methods generate spatially resolved RNA localization and expression data at an almost single-cell resolution.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><published>1525813200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</link><fingerprint>e13f6984</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>María Mercedes Elizalde</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</link><fingerprint>8ebdd4d7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Corey L.

The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42269:5785ab88</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197069</originId><title>Allele and dosage specificity of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Peg3&amp;lt;/i&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation.

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543b:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</originId><title>Growth medium-dependent antimicrobial activity of early stage MEP pathway inhibitors</title><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where colour comes from, the secret lives of fish and growth in democracies: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where colour comes from, the secret lives of fish and growth in democracies: Books in brief, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05008-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05008-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week&apos;s best science picks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525244400000</published><fingerprint>c0c19de7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Barbara Kiser</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where colour comes from, the secret lives of fish and growth in democracies: Books in brief&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where colour comes from, the secret lives of fish and growth in democracies: Books in brief, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05008-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05008-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Barbara Kiser reviews five of the week&apos;s best science picks.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><crawled>1525259218017</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1632088ac61:38a8b0:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05008-0</originId><title>Where colour comes from, the secret lives of fish and growth in democracies: Books in brief</title><engagement>20</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05008-0</href></item></alternate><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05008-0</link></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Clark, Vera Hapiak, Mitchell Oakes, Holly Mills, Richard Komuniecki&lt;/p&gt;
Monoamines and neuropeptides often modulate the same behavior, but monoaminergic-peptidergic crosstalk remains poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the adrenergic-like ligands, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) require distinct subsets of neuropeptides in the two ASI sensory neurons to inhibit nociception. TA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-14&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nlp-18&lt;/i&gt; from either synaptic/perisynaptic regions of ASI axons or the ASI soma, respectively, and OA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-9&lt;/i&gt; asymmetrically, from only the synaptic/perisynaptic region of the right ASI axon. The predicted amino acid preprosequences of genes encoding either TA- or OA-dependent neuropeptides differed markedly. However, these distinct preprosequences were not sufficient to confer monoamine-specificity and additional N-terminal peptide-encoding sequence was required. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TA and OA specifically and differentially modulate the release of distinct subsets of neuropeptides from different subcellular sites within the ASIs, highlighting the complexity of monoaminergic/peptidergic modulation, even in animals with a relatively simple nervous system.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</link><fingerprint>6e03ce43</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Tobias Clark</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Clark, Vera Hapiak, Mitchell Oakes, Holly Mills, Richard Komuniecki&lt;/p&gt;

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</link><fingerprint>ca9bf785</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jing Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock’s biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196483</link><fingerprint>3f6a6fbd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Philipp Neubauer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp Neubauer, James T.

Studies on &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; would benefit from the introduction of new selectable markers to allow more complex types of experiments to be conducted with this model animal. We established a new antibiotic selection marker for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt;). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</link><fingerprint>2f1c4bbd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Hiroyuki Obinata</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Obinata, Asako Sugimoto, Shinsuke Niwa&lt;/p&gt;

Age is a major risk factor for diseases caused by ischemic hypoxia, such as stroke and coronary artery disease. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are the major cells respond to ischemic hypoxia through angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. However, the effect of aging on EPCs and their responses to hypoxia are not well understood. CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and aged by replicative senescence, which was to passage cells until their doubling time was twice as long as the original cells. Young and aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs were exposed to a hypoxic environment (1% oxygen for 48hrs) and their gene expression profiles were evaluated using gene expression array. Gene array results were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and BALB/c female athymic nude mice hindlimb ischemia model. We identified 115 differentially expressed genes in young CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, 54 differentially expressed genes in aged CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs, and 25 common genes between normoxia and hypoxia groups. Among them, the expression of solute carrier family 2 (facilitated glucose transporter), member 1 (SLC2A1) increased the most by hypoxia in young cells. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated the pathways affected by aging and hypoxia most, including genes “response to oxygen levels” in young EPCs and genes involved “chondroitin sulfate metabolic process” in aged cells. Our study results indicate the key factors that contribute to the effects of aging on response to hypoxia in CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; EPCs.

The macaque is widely accepted as a suitable model for preclinical characterization of dengue vaccine candidates. However, the only vaccine for which both preclinical and clinical efficacy results were reported so far showed efficacy levels that were substantially different between macaques and humans. We hypothesized that this model’s predictive capacity may be improved using recent and minimally passaged dengue virus isolates, and by assessing vaccine efficacy by characterizing not only the post-dengue virus challenge viremia/RNAemia but also the associated-cytokine profile. Ten recent and minimally passaged Brazilian clinical isolates from the four dengue virus serotypes were tested for their infectivity in rhesus macaques. For the strains showing robust replication capacity, the associated-changes in soluble mediator levels, and the elicited dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses, were also characterized. Three isolates from dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 4 induced viremia of high magnitude and longer duration relative to previously reported viremia kinetics in this model, and robust dengue virus-neutralizing antibody responses. Consistent with observations in humans, increased MCP-1, IFN-γ and VEGF-A levels, and transiently decreased IL-8 levels were detected after infection with the selected isolates. These results may contribute to establishing a dengue macaque model showing a higher predictability for vaccine efficacy in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196311</link><fingerprint>a848de53</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Maria Beatriz Borges</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Beatriz Borges, Renato Sergio Marchevsky, Ygara S.

Despite prior reports of intramolecular (Conia-ene-type) reactions and confirmation here that Cu(I)-based catalysts are effective, NMR studies indicated that a dual catalytic approach using separate amine and pi-acid catalysts may not be feasible for intermolecular reactions due to undesirable enamine competition with alkynes for metal complexation. Bifunctional precatalysts were designed with tridentate ligands and potentially hemilabile heterocyclic spacers, expected to be suitable for the binding of pi-acidic metals such as copper (I) and silver (I). The structures of the designed catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the relative energies of putative catalytic intermediates were estimated.

Despite prior reports of intramolecular (Conia-ene-type) reactions and confirmation here that Cu(I)-based catalysts are effective, NMR studies indicated that a dual catalytic approach using separate amine and pi-acid catalysts may not be feasible for intermolecular reactions due to undesirable enamine competition with alkynes for metal complexation. Bifunctional precatalysts were designed with tridentate ligands and potentially hemilabile heterocyclic spacers, expected to be suitable for the binding of pi-acidic metals such as copper (I) and silver (I). The structures of the designed catalysts were computed using density functional theory (DFT), and the relative energies of putative catalytic intermediates were estimated.

Background &lt;p&gt;Bedaquiline, an antimycobacterial agent approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis, is metabolized by CYP3A4, an hepatic enzyme strongly induced by rifampin, an essential part of drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment. We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole blood culture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo M tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected whole blood cultures (WBA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of rifabutin plus bedaquiline produces sustained intracellular mycobactericidal activity that is greater than the sum of their individual effects.

Mercury (Hg) is deposited from the atmosphere to remote areas such as forests, but the amount of Hg in trees is not well known. To determine the importance of Hg in trees, we analyzed foliage, bark and bole wood of eight tree species at four sites in the northeastern USA (Huntington Forest, NY; Sleepers River, VT; Hubbard Brook, NH; Bear Brook, ME). Foliar concentrations of Hg averaged 16.3 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; among the hardwood species, which was significantly lower than values in conifers, which averaged 28.6 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Similarly, bark concentrations of Hg were lower (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in hardwoods (7.7 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than conifers (22.5 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For wood, concentrations of Hg were higher in yellow birch (2.1–2.8 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and white pine (2.3 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than in the other species, which averaged 1.4 ng g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Sites differed significantly in Hg concentrations of foliage and bark (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), which are directly exposed to the atmosphere, but the concentration of Hg in wood depended more on species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) than site (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.60). The Hg contents of tree tissues in hardwood stands, estimated from modeled biomass and measured concentrations at each site, were higher in bark (mean of 0.10 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and wood (0.16 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) than in foliage (0.06 g ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).

To date, the RV144 HIV vaccine trial has been the only study to show that immunization can confer protection from HIV infection. While encouraging, the modest 31.2% (P = 0.04) efficacy achieved in this study left significant room for improvement, and created an incentive to optimize the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine immunogens to increase the level of vaccine efficacy. Since the completion of the RV144 trial, our understanding of the antigenic structure of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and of the specificity of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that bind to it, has significantly improved. In particular, we have learned that multiple families of bN-mAbs require specific oligomannose glycans for binding. Both of the monomeric gp120 immunogens (MN- and A244-rgp120) in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial were enriched for glycans containing high levels of sialic acid, and lacked critical N-linked glycosylation sites required for binding by several families of bN-mAbs. The absence of these epitopes may have contributed to the low level of efficacy achieved in this study. In this report, we describe our efforts to improve the antigenic structure of the rgp120 immunogens used in the vaccine by optimizing glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by multiple bN-mAbs. Our results demonstrated that by shifting the location of one PNGS in A244-rgp120, and by adding two PNGS to MN-rgp120, in conjunction with the production of both proteins in a cell line that favors the incorporation of oligomannose glycans, we could significantly improve the binding by three major families of bN-mAbs. The immunogens described here represent a second generation of gp120-based vaccine immunogens that exhibit potential for use in RV144 follow-up studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><published>1524603600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</link><fingerprint>d05a1ba6</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Rachel C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Many vaccines contain multiple components. Licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) contain polysaccharides from 7, 10, or 13 different serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. The main outcomes in randomised trials of pneumococcal vaccines are serotype-specific antibody measures. Comparisons are made between groups for each serotype, resulting in multiple separate comparisons of treatment effects which can be complicated to interpret. We investigated methods for computing the overall difference between vaccine groups across all serotypes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal antibody concentrations were obtained from a randomised controlled trial of ten-valent pneumococcal vaccine, conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal. Infants received either 2 priming doses of vaccine at 6 and 14 weeks of age followed by a booster (2+1), or 3 priming doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age with no booster (3+0). The overall difference between vaccine schedules across all serotypes was computed at each visit using a multivariate linear model with equal weights for each serotype. Alternative weights were derived from invasive pneumococcal disease cases in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and from estimates of the relative invasiveness of each serotype and used in sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;When 10 separate estimates of treatment differences were computed the ratio of antibody responses for each serotype in the 2+1 group compared with the 3+0 group at 10 months of age varied greatly, with serotype-specific GMRs ranging from 2.80 for serotype 14, to 9.14 for serotype 18C. Using equal weights for each serotype, the overall geometric mean ratio (GMR) was 5.02 (95% CI 4.06−6.22) at 10 months of age, and 1.46 (95% CI 1.14−1.88) at 3 years of age. Using weights based on disease incidence gave GMRs ranging from 5.15 to 6.63 at 10 months of age, and 1.47 to 1.78 at 3 years of age. Using weights based on relative invasiveness gave estimates of 6.81 and 1.59, at 10 months and 3 years respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PCV clinical trial data have a multivariate structure with correlated outcomes for different serotypes. When analysing each serotype separately, the multiple estimates of the treatment effect can complicate the interpretation of trial results. Reporting a single overall estimate which accounts for the correlation between outcomes can simplify such interpretation. Treatment effects can be weighted equally or alternative weights derived from independent data can be used.Many modern vaccines have multiple components, such as quadrivalent meningococcal group ACWY vaccine or four-component group B meningococcal vaccine, thus these methods are widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196200</link><fingerprint>a8293a86</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Merryn Voysey</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Merryn Voysey, Andrew J.

Furthermore, the notebook web interface and the companion Docker distribution of logical modelling tools greatly facilitate the production of accessible and reproducible model analysis workflows.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><crawled>1525989409059</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1634c0e8123:16e584b:93d646dc</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319780v1?rss=1</originId><title>Prediction of Mutations to Control Pathways Enabling Tumour Cell Invasion with the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook (Tutorial) [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319780v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/10/319780</canonicalUrl></item><item><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00060/20180504/images/medium/jm-2018-00060e_0014.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>126</height></visual><published>1525406400000</published><fingerprint>26c491ed</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jacek Kwiatkowski, Boping Liu, Doris Hui Ying Tee, Guoying Chen, Nur Huda Binte Ahmad, Yun Xuan Wong, Zhi Ying Poh, Shi Hua Ang, Eldwin Sum Wai Tan, Esther HQ Ong, Nurul Dinie, Anders Poulsen, Vishal Pendharkar, Kanda Sangthongpitag, May Ann Lee, Sugunavathi Sepramaniam, Soo Yei Ho, Joseph Cherian, Jeffrey Hill, Thomas H.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;One of the characteristics of early osteoarthritis (OA) is the loss of fixed charged density (FCD) of glycosaminoglycans in the superficial zone of articular cartilage. However, possible local changes in the FCD content of the pericellular matrix (PCM) are not fully understood. Hence, our aim was to investigate the effect of unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in rabbit knees on estimated FCD in the PCM compared to that in the ECM, and relate these results with cell morphology.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Articular cartilage samples were collected from ACLT, contralateral and intact control knee joints from lateral and medial femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, and from the femoral groove and patella. Histological samples were prepared and stained with Safranin-O to estimate the FCD content around the chondrocytes in the PCM and the ECM with digital densitometry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As a result of ACLT, the greatest decreases in the FCD content of the PCM were observed in the superficial zone of the lateral femoral condyle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), medial tibial plateau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and patellar (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) cartilage. The normalized FCD content of the PCM compared to the surrounding ECM was increased most in the femoral condyles (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and medial tibial plateau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) cartilage. The high normalized FCD content of the PCM in the superficial zone of lateral femoral condyle cartilage was consistent with the round cell morphology in that location.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we suggest that certain sites in the knee joint, particularly the lateral femoral condyle cartilage, experience less FCD loss in the PCM than in the ECM in early post-traumatic OA, which could lead to altered cell shape.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196203</link><fingerprint>ca83b53</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Simo P.

Finally, we identified 54 proteins that caused ligand-independent ERK activation with potential as biomarkers for drug resistance in cells carrying BRAF mutations.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><crawled>1525799861287</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16340c23c27:44ef33:2835af05</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</originId><title>Analysis of the human kinome and phosphatome reveals diseased signaling networks induced by overexpression [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/08/314716</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006111</link><fingerprint>43c026a0</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Michael F.

A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</link><fingerprint>ead87314</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jared Adolf-Bryfogle</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6–8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;mRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 ± 0.42 vs. 0.81 ± 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524862800000</updated><published>1524862800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196739</link><fingerprint>8c9682ae</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Moritz Messner</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Moritz Messner, Santhosh Kumar Ghadge, Valentina Goetsch, Andreas Wimmer, Jakob Dörler, Gerhard Pölzl, Marc-Michael Zaruba&lt;/p&gt;

The molecular mechanisms through which dendritic cells (DCs) prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses, including those elicited by parasitic helminths, remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that soluble egg antigen (SEA) from &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, which is well known to drive potent Th2 responses, triggers DCs to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which subsequently—in an autocrine manner—induces OX40 ligand (OX40L) expression to license these DCs to drive Th2 responses. Mechanistically, SEA was found to promote PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, and via a downstream signaling cascade involving spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). In addition, this pathway was activated independently of the actions of omega-1 (ω-1), a previously described Th2-priming glycoprotein present in SEA. These findings were supported by in vivo murine data showing that ω-1–independent Th2 priming by SEA was mediated by Dectin-2 and Syk signaling in DCs. Finally, we found that Dectin-2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and to a lesser extent Dectin-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, displayed impaired Th2 responses and reduced egg-driven granuloma formation following &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; infection, highlighting the physiological importance of this pathway in Th2 polarization during a helminth infection. In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><published>1524085200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005504</link><fingerprint>4fb82e6d</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Maria M.

In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><crawled>1524074766525</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb316f:76251cdd</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005504</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005504</href></item></canonical><title>Dectin-1/2–induced autocrine PGE&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; signaling licenses dendritic cells to prime Th2 responses</title><engagement>2</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/JxCwEstI3Wg/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1524078544053</recrawled></item><item><content><content>The collection of immunoglobulin genes in an individual&apos;s germline, which gives rise to B cell receptors via recombination, is known to vary significantly across individuals.

We previously demonstrated that transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 5 (TRPV5) expression was decreased in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with that in normal kidney tissues, a finding that was correlated with vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression, but further investigations is warranted. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether VDR could regulate the expression of TRPV5 and affect proliferation and metastasis in RCC. In this study, we used lentivirus to conduct the model of VDR overexpression and knockdown caki-1 and 786-O RCC cell lines &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The results demonstrated that VDR overexpression significantly inhibited RCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis by the MTT, transwell cell migration/invasion and flow cytometry assays, respectively. However, VDR knockdown in RCC cells had the opposite effect. The RNA-sequence assay, which was assessed in caki-1 cells after VDR overexpression and knockdown, also indicated that significantly differentially expressed genes were associated with cell apoptotic, differentiation, proliferation and migration. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that VDR knockdown increased TRPV5 expression and VDR overexpression decreased TRPV5 expression in caki-1 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of TRPV5 expression suppressed the VDR knockdown-induced change in the proliferation, migration and invasion in caki-1 cells. Taken together, these findings confirmed that VDR functions as a tumour suppressor in RCC cells and suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of RCC through regulating the expression of TRPV5.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195844</link><fingerprint>21cb99ee</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>YongMing Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by YongMing Chen, XinYu Liu, FaBiao Zhang, ShanFan Liao, XiYuan He, DeXiang Zhuo, HuaiBin Huang, YongYang Wu&lt;/p&gt;

In ultracold ensembles of neutral atoms, nonclassical states have been generated with mutual entanglement among thousands of particles.

Enniatins are common contaminants of food and feed and belong to the group of the “emerging” mycotoxins, which are produced by various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species. Although a wide range of toxic effects, like antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal and cytotoxic properties, have been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, so far, no cases of mycotoxicosis connected to enniatins &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are reported. Among this group of mycotoxins, enniatin B and enniatin B1 are the most prevalent compounds and therefore are present in the human diet. Enniatins can reach systemic circulation, thus, the investigation of possible neurotoxic effects is of importance. Different cerebral cells were used to address effects on cell death having an impact on the blood-brain barrier. The influence of enniatin B and enniatin B1 on cellular viability was examined via Cell Counting kit-8 assay (CCK-8) in three different cell types of the blood-brain barrier: porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (PBCEC), human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and human astrocytoma cells (CCF-STTG1). CCF-STTG1 cells were more sensitive to enniatin B (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.9 μM) and enniatin B1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.4 μM) than both endothelial cell types. In CCF-STTG1 cells, caspase-3 activation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were evaluated. Both compounds did not induce any LDH release and only enniatin B increased caspase-3 activity as a marker for apoptosis. The transport kinetics of enniatin B and enniatin B1 across the blood-brain barrier &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated using PBCEC, cultivated on Transwell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; filter inserts. Analysis of the apical and the basolateral compartment by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed high influx rates for enniatin B and enniatin B1.

&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic protist possessing a limited set of proteins involved in the autophagy pathway, a self-degradative machinery for protein and organelle recycling. This distant eukaryote has even repurposed part of this machinery, centered on protein ATG8, for a non-degradative function related to the maintenance of the apicoplast, a parasite-specific organelle. However, some evidence also suggest &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; is able to generate autophagic vesicles upon stress, and that some autophagy-related proteins, such as ATG9, might be involved solely in the canonical autophagy function. Here, we have characterised TgPROP1 and TgPROP2, two &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; proteins containing WD-40 repeat that can bind lipids for their recruitment to vesicular structures upon stress. They belong to the PROPPIN family and are homologues to ATG18/WIPI, which are known to be important for the autophagic process. We conducted a functional analysis of these two &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; PROPPINs. One of them is dispensable for normal &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth, although it may play a role for parasite survival in specific stress conditions or for parasite fitness in the host, through a canonical autophagy-related function. The other, however, seems important for parasite viability in normal growth conditions and could be primarily involved in a non-canonical function.

The technological revolution in molecular biology has led to the identification of numerous genes implicated in the regulation of diverse temporal biological processes.

The technological revolution in molecular biology has led to the identification of numerous genes implicated in the regulation of diverse temporal biological processes. However, it is natural to question whether there is an underlying regulatory network governing multiple timescales simultaneously. Results: Using queries of relevant databases and literature searches, a single dense multiscale temporal regulatory network was identified involving core sets of genes that regulate circadian, cell cycle, and aging processes.

Combining a deep neural network with fuzzy theory, this paper proposes an advertising click-through rate (CTR) prediction approach based on a fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN). In this approach, fuzzy Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (FGBRBM) is first applied to input raw data from advertising datasets. Next, fuzzy restricted Boltzmann machine (FRBM) is used to construct the fuzzy deep belief network (FDBN) with the unsupervised method layer by layer. Finally, fuzzy logistic regression (FLR) is utilized for modeling the CTR.

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><published>1526331600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</link><fingerprint>29931a48</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Mathias F.

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196158</link><fingerprint>4cb79259</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Enid Schatz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;
South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so.

Citrinin (CIT) is a hepato-nephrotoxic fungal metabolite produced by the genera &lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Monascu&lt;/i&gt;. There is an increasing demand for rapid and economical methods for detection CIT residues in fruit. In this study, we developed an immunochromatographic strip (ICS) for detection of citrinin (CIT) residues in fruit for the first time. Anti-CIT monoclonal antibody (McAb) 2B9 was prepared, with a binding affinity of 9.39 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; L/moL. Conjugates CIT-BSA and McAb 2B9 were used to develop the ICS which could be completed in 5 min, with the detection limit of 50 ng/mL and no cross reactivity with other mycotoxins. Analysis of CIT in 64 fruit samples revealed that data obtained from the ICS test were in good agreement with indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ic-ELISAs) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Understanding the impact of ILs on living organisms, especially from the aquatic ecosystem, is urgent, since on one side large amounts of these substances are widely employed as solvents in industrial chemical processes, and on the other side evidences of toxic effects of ILs on microorganisms and single cells have been observed. To date, the toxicity of ILs have been investigated by means of macroscopic assays aimed at characterizing the effective concentrations (like the EC50) that cause the dead of a significant fraction of the population of microorganisms and cells. These studies allowed to identify the cell membrane as the first target of the IL interaction, whose effectiveness was correlated to the lipophilicity of the cation, i.e. to the length of the lateral alkyl chain. Our study aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of the toxicity of ILs. To this purpose, we carried out a combined topographic and mechanical analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy of living breast metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) upon interaction with imidazolium-based ILs. We showed that ILs are able to induce modifications of the overall rigidity (effective Young modulus) and morphology of the cells.

Understanding the impact of ILs on living organisms, especially from the aquatic ecosystem, is urgent, since on one side large amounts of these substances are widely employed as solvents in industrial chemical processes, and on the other side evidences of toxic effects of ILs on microorganisms and single cells have been observed. To date, the toxicity of ILs have been investigated by means of macroscopic assays aimed at characterizing the effective concentrations (like the EC50) that cause the dead of a significant fraction of the population of microorganisms and cells. These studies allowed to identify the cell membrane as the first target of the IL interaction, whose effectiveness was correlated to the lipophilicity of the cation, i.e. to the length of the lateral alkyl chain. Our study aimed at characterizing the molecular mechanisms of the toxicity of ILs. To this purpose, we carried out a combined topographic and mechanical analysis by Atomic Force Microscopy of living breast metastatic cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) upon interaction with imidazolium-based ILs. We showed that ILs are able to induce modifications of the overall rigidity (effective Young modulus) and morphology of the cells. Our results demonstrate that ILs act on the physical properties of the cell membrane, and possibly induce cytoskeletal reorganization, already at concentrations below the EC50. These potentially toxic effects are stronger at higher IL concentrations, as well as with longer lateral chains in the cation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16326a8c50f:d46347:3dd877af</id><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Imidazolium-Based_Ionic_Liquids_Affect_Morphology_and_Rigidity_of_Living_Cells_an_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Study/6216383</originId><title>Imidazolium-Based Ionic Liquids Affect Morphology and Rigidity of Living Cells: an Atomic Force Microscopy Study</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Imidazolium-Based_Ionic_Liquids_Affect_Morphology_and_Rigidity_of_Living_Cells_an_Atomic_Force_Microscopy_Study/6216383</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses, Published online: 14 May 2018;

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005439</link><fingerprint>1cb6484f</fingerprint><engagementRate>0.08</engagementRate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Robert Lanfear</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

If a density functional theory (DFT) method is able to yield accurate dipole moments, it should first provide an accurate geometry and then predict a reliable charge distribution for that geometry. In this respect, recent literatures have revealed that most DFT approximations work considerably better for single‐reference molecules with respect to multi‐reference ones, as may be expected from this fact that DFT utilizes a single configuration state function as reference function to represent the density.

If a density functional theory (DFT) method is able to yield accurate dipole moments, it should first provide an accurate geometry and then predict a reliable charge distribution for that geometry. In this respect, recent literatures have revealed that most DFT approximations work considerably better for single‐reference molecules with respect to multi‐reference ones, as may be expected from this fact that DFT utilizes a single configuration state function as reference function to represent the density.

Here we investigate the mechanism and implications of G2 arrest in progenitors of the adult thoracic tracheal epithelium (tracheoblasts). We report that tracheoblasts pause in G2 for ~48-56 h and grow in size over this period. Surprisingly, tracheoblasts arrested in G2 express drivers of G2-M like Cdc25/String (Stg). We find that mechanisms that prevent G2-M are also in place in this interval. Tracheoblasts activate Checkpoint Kinase 1/Grapes (Chk1/Grp) in an ATR/mei-41-dependent manner. Loss of ATR/Chk1 led to precocious mitotic entry ~24-32 h earlier. These divisions were apparently normal as there was no evidence of increased DNA damage or cell death.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) proceeds through a series of morphological changes of the plasma membrane induced by a number of protein components. Although the spatiotemporal assembly of these proteins has been elucidated by fluorescence-based techniques, the protein-induced morphological changes of the plasma membrane have not been fully clarified in living cells. Here, we visualize membrane morphology together with protein localizations during CME by utilizing high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) combined with a confocal laser scanning unit. The plasma membrane starts to invaginate approximately 30 s after clathrin starts to assemble, and the aperture diameter increases as clathrin accumulates. Actin rapidly accumulates around the pit and induces a small membrane swelling, which, within 30 s, rapidly covers the pit irreversibly. Inhibition of actin turnover abolishes the swelling and induces a reversible open–close motion of the pit, indicating that actin dynamics are necessary for efficient and irreversible pit closure at the end of CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_c4txNHahJg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525381200000</updated><published>1525381200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004786</link><fingerprint>9bf22316</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Aiko Yoshida</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aiko Yoshida, Nobuaki Sakai, Yoshitsugu Uekusa, Yuka Imaoka, Yoshitsuna Itagaki, Yuki Suzuki, Shige H.

Flavonoids, a class of natural compounds with variable phenolic structures, have been found to possess anti-cancer activities by modulating different enzymes and receptors like CDK6. To understand the binding behavior of flavonoids that inhibit the active CDK6, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on six inhibitors, chrysin (M01), fisetin (M03), galangin (M04), genistein (M05), quercetin (M06) and kaempferol (M07), complexed with CDK6/cyclin D. For all six flavonoids, the 3’-OH and 4’-OH of B-ring were found to be favorable for hydrogen bond formation, but the 3-OH on the C-ring and 5-OH on the A-ring were unfavorable, which were confirmed by the MD simulation results of the test molecule, 3’, 4’, 7-trihydroxyflavone (M15). The binding efficiencies of flavonoids against the CDK6/cyclin D complex were mainly through the electrostatic (especially the H-bond force) and vdW interactions with residues ILE19, VAL27, ALA41, GLU61, PHE98, GLN103, ASP163 and LEU152. The order of binding affinities of these flavonoids toward the CDK6/cyclin D was M03 &gt; M01 &gt; M07 &gt; M15 &gt; M06 &gt; M05 &gt; M04. It is anticipated that the binding features of flavonoid inhibitors studied in the present work may provide valuable insights for the development of CDK6 inhibitors.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525208400000</updated><published>1525208400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196651</link><fingerprint>a013a5ac</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Jingxiao Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jingxiao Zhang, Lilei Zhang, Yangcheng Xu, Shanshan Jiang, Yueyue Shao&lt;/p&gt;

They are involved in receptor-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling and have been proposed to act as store-operated channels (SOC). Their malfunction is related to cardiomyopathies and their modulation by small molecules has been shown to be effective against renal cancer cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the complex activation and regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of zebrafish TRPC4 in its unliganded (apo), closed state at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the cation conducting pore, including the selectivity filter and lower gate. The cytoplasmic domain contains two key hubs that have been shown to interact with modulating proteins. Structural comparisons with other TRP channels give novel insights into the general architecture and domain organization of this superfamily of channels and help to understand their function and pharmacology.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><crawled>1525262602260</crawled><summary><content>Canonical transient receptor channels (TRPC) are non-selective cation channels.

Their malfunction is related to cardiomyopathies and their modulation by small molecules has been shown to be effective against renal cancer cells. The molecular mechanism underlying the complex activation and regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report the electron cryo-microscopy structure of zebrafish TRPC4 in its unliganded (apo), closed state at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. The structure reveals the molecular architecture of the cation conducting pore, including the selectivity filter and lower gate. The cytoplasmic domain contains two key hubs that have been shown to interact with modulating proteins. Structural comparisons with other TRP channels give novel insights into the general architecture and domain organization of this superfamily of channels and help to understand their function and pharmacology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16320bc5014:418b29:5785ab88</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36615</originId><title>Electron cryo-microscopy structure of the canonical TRPC4 ion channel</title><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36615</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36615</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Graham-Clarke, Alison Rushton, Timothy Noblet, John Marriott&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42). Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: non-medical prescriber, human factors, and organisational aspects. Each theme consisted of several sub-themes; the four most highly mentioned were ‘medical professionals’, ‘area of competence’, ‘impact on time’ and ‘service’. Sub-themes were frequently interdependent on each other, having the potential to act as a barrier or facilitator depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Addressing the identified themes and subthemes enables strategies to be developed to support and optimise non-medical prescribing. Further research is required to identify if similar themes are encountered by other non-medical prescribing groups than nurses and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525122000000</updated><published>1525122000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</link><fingerprint>a188ce10</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Emma Graham-Clarke</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Graham-Clarke, Alison Rushton, Timothy Noblet, John Marriott&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are regarded as the cornerstone of conventional treatment for AS. However little is known about concomitant NSAID use during treatment (with TNF-α inhibitors) in daily clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Consecutive patients from the GLAS cohort were included. NSAID use and ASAS-NSAID index were evaluated at group level and at individual patient level during 52 weeks of follow-up. Analyses were stratified for treatment regimen. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to evaluate NSAID use in relation to assessments of disease activity over time. In patients starting TNF-α inhibitors (n = 254), 79% used NSAIDs at baseline and this proportion decreased significantly to 38% at 52 weeks. ASAS-NSAID index also decreased significantly from median 65 to 0. In patients on conventional treatment (n = 139), 74% used NSAIDs at baseline with median ASAS-NSAID index of 50 and this remained stable during follow-up. At each follow-up visit, approximately half of the patients changed their type or dose of NSAIDs. GEE analysis over time showed that NSAID use was associated with AS disease activity score (p&amp;lt;0.05). This relation was more pronounced in patients treated with TNF-α inhibitors compared to conventional treatment (B = 0.825 vs. B = 0.250).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort of established AS patients, there was no difference in baseline NSAID use between patients with and without indication for TNF-α inhibitors.

Despite the existence of the prophylactic Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, infection by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (Mtb) remains a major public health issue causing up to 1.8 million annual deaths worldwide. Increasing prevalence of Mtb strains resistant to antibiotics represents an urgent threat for global health that has prompted a search for alternative treatment regimens not subject to development of resistance. Immunotherapy constitutes a promising approach to improving current antibiotic treatments through engagement of the host’s immune system. We designed a multi-antigenic and multiphasic vaccine, based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus, denoted MVATG18598, which expresses ten antigens classically described as representative of each of different phases of Mtb infection. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis coupled with multiple-passage evaluation demonstrated that this vaccine is genetically stable, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. fit for manufacturing. Using different mouse strains, we show that MVATG18598 vaccination results in both Th1-associated T-cell responses and cytolytic activity, targeting all 10 vaccine-expressed Mtb antigens. In chronic post-exposure mouse models, MVATG18598 vaccination in combination with an antibiotic regimen decreases the bacterial burden in the lungs of infected mice, compared with chemotherapy alone, and is associated with long-lasting antigen-specific Th1-type T cell and antibody responses. In one model, co-treatment with MVATG18598 prevented relapse of the disease after treatment completion, an important clinical goal. Overall, results demonstrate the capacity of the therapeutic MVATG18598 vaccine to improve efficacy of chemotherapy against TB. These data support further development of this novel immunotherapeutic in the treatment of Mtb infections.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196815</link><fingerprint>5d9ad576</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Stéphane Leung-Theung-Long</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stéphane Leung-Theung-Long, Charles-Antoine Coupet, Marie Gouanvic, Doris Schmitt, Aurélie Ray, Chantal Hoffmann, Huguette Schultz, Sandeep Tyagi, Heena Soni, Paul J.

The refined or &lt;i&gt;data-assimilated&lt;/i&gt; MSM reproduces the FRET data and features hairpin one in the transition-state ensemble, consistent with mutation experiments. The folding pathway in the data-assimilated MSM suggests interplay between hydrophobic contacts and turn formation. Our method provides a general framework for investigating conformational transitions in other proteins.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16326ed6c20:db8bbd:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32668</originId><title>Linking time-series of single-molecule experiments with molecular dynamics simulations by machine learning</title><engagement>3</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32668</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32668</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Rancher-reported efficacy of lethal and non-lethal livestock predation mitigation strategies for a suite of carnivores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Rancher-reported efficacy of lethal and non-lethal livestock predation mitigation strategies for a suite of carnivores, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26270-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26270-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Rancher-reported efficacy of lethal and non-lethal livestock predation mitigation strategies for a suite of carnivores&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/UQ5qOGuK59M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>676c9bac</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</link><fingerprint>681245ca</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Emine Yaylali</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT).

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</link><fingerprint>2fd88f31</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Alison M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The participation of general practitioners (GPs) in primary care research is variable and often poor. We aimed to develop a substantive and empirical theoretical framework to explain GPs’ decision-making process to participate in research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used the grounded theory approach to construct a substantive theory to explain the decision-making process of GPs to participate in research activities. Five in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted among 21 GPs. Purposeful sampling followed by theoretical sampling were used to attempt saturation of the core category. Data were collected using semi-structured open-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked prior to analysis. Open line-by-line coding followed by focus coding were used to arrive at a substantive theory. Memoing was used to help bring concepts to higher abstract levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The GPs’ decision to participate in research was attributed to their inner drive and appreciation for primary care research and their confidence in managing their social and research environments. The drive and appreciation for research motivated the GPs to undergo research training to enhance their research knowledge, skills and confidence. However, the critical step in the GPs’ decision to participate in research was their ability to align their research agenda with priorities in their social environment, which included personal life goals, clinical practice and organisational culture. Perceived support for research, such as funding and technical expertise, facilitated the GPs’ participation in research. In addition, prior experiences participating in research also influenced the GPs’ confidence in taking part in future research.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The key to GPs deciding to participate in research is whether the research agenda aligns with the priorities in their social environment.

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs.

However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd9:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</originId><title>An assessment of false positive rates for malaria rapid diagnostic tests caused by non-&amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&amp;lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>We propose a novel variational auto-encoder-based method for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

The white-backed planthopper, &lt;i&gt;Sogatella furcifera&lt;/i&gt;, is a phloem sap feeder that secretes watery and gelling saliva during feeding. In this study, we identified the major proteins in watery saliva of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; by shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis combined with transcriptomic analysis. A total of 161 proteins were identified, which were divided into 8 function categories, including enzymes, transporter, calcium ion binding protein, salivary sheath protein, cytoskeleton protein, DNA-, RNA-, and protein-binding or regulating proteins, other non-enzyme proteins and unknown proteins. Gene expression pattern of 11 secretory proteins were analyzed by real time quantitative-PCR. We detected the mucin-like protein, which had a unique expression level in salivary gland, most likely to be a candidate effector involved in regulation of plant defense. This study identified the watery saliva component of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; and it provided a list of proteins which may play a role in interaction between &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;furcifera&lt;/i&gt; and rice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525467600000</updated><published>1525467600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193831</link><fingerprint>5877f71c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yu-Tong Miao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Tong Miao, Yao Deng, Hao-Kang Jia, Yu-Di Liu, Mao-Lin Hou&lt;/p&gt;

Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their three dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus, next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

Few attempts have been made to increase our understanding of the relationship between urbanization and disease dynamics, although...</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><crawled>1525205300057</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c6d:fc1f8953</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4707.short?rss=1</originId><title>Urbanization prolongs hantavirus epidemics in cities [Environmental Sciences]</title><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4707.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/18/4707/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>288</height></visual><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4707</canonicalUrl></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</link><published>1526578752000</published><fingerprint>196ae3a3</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Poulin, P.</name></author><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395d4:3dd877af</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>How to achieve a successful biaxial marriage</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</href></item></alternate><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/712.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lightwave valleytronics in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lightwave valleytronics in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0013-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0013-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A strong lightwave in a monolayer of tungsten diselenide drives changes in the valley pseudospin, making valley pseudospin an information carrier that is switchable faster than a single light cycle.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525244400000</published><fingerprint>d8d4a13a</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>F.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525813200000</updated><published>1525813200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Matthew E.

Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be a significant problem. Furthermore, the precise pathogenesis of this neurodegeneration is still unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and neuronal injury in the rhesus macaque using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; sampling techniques. The effect of SIV infection in 23 adult rhesus macaques was investigated using an accelerated NeuroAIDS model. Disease progression was modulated either with combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART, 4 animals) or minocycline (7 animals). Twelve animals remained untreated. Viral loads were monitored in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, as were levels of activated monocytes in the blood. Neuronal injury was monitored &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Viral RNA was quantified in brain tissue of each animal &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and neuronal injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Without treatment, viral RNA in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain tissue appears to reach a plateau. Neuronal injury was highly correlated both to plasma viral levels and a subset of infected/activated monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which are known to traffic the virus into the brain. Treatment with either cART or minocycline decreased brain viral levels and partially reversed alterations in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and immunohistochemical markers for neuronal injury. These findings suggest there is significant turnover of replicating virus within the brain and the severity of neuronal injury is directly related to the brain viral load.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><published>1526072400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196949</link><fingerprint>8c5b4e29</fingerprint><engagementRate>1.0</engagementRate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>R.

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and “clean” adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>8f44eb7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Akram El Kateb</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197061</link><fingerprint>defe3df3</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Miguel D.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). Our findings demonstrate that TIMP1 delays photoreceptor cell death.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). Our findings demonstrate that TIMP1 delays photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into how TIMP1 works in the mouse animal model of RP.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3beea:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</originId><title>Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 enhances rod survival in the &amp;lt;i&gt;rd1&amp;lt;/i&gt; mouse retina</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathanial R.

The cutaneous silent period is an inhibitory evoked response that demonstrates a wide variety of responses in muscles of the human upper limb. Classically, the cutaneous silent period results in a characteristic muscle pattern of extensor inhibition and flexor facilitation within the upper limb, in the presence of nociceptive input. The aims of the current study were: 1) to primarily investigate the presence and characteristics of the cutaneous silent period response across multiple extensor and flexor muscles of the upper limb, and 2) to secondarily investigate the influence of stimulation site on this nociceptive reflex response. It was hypothesized that the cutaneous silent period would be present in all muscles, regardless of role (flexion/extension) or the stimulation site. Twenty-two healthy, university-age adults (14 males; 8 females; 23 ± 5 yrs) participated in the study. Testing consisted of three different stimulation sites (Digit II, V, and II+III nociceptive stimulation) during a low intensity, sustained muscle contraction, in which, 7 upper limb muscles were monitored via surface EMG recording electrodes. Distal muscles of the upper limb presented with the earliest reflex onset times, longest reflex duration, and lowest level of EMG suppression when compared to the more proximal muscles, regardless of extensor/flexor role. Additionally, the greatest overall inhibitory influence was expressed within the distal muscles. In conclusion, the present study provides a new level of refinement within the current understanding of the spinal organization associated with nociceptive input processing and the associated motor control of the upper limb. Subsequently, these results have further implications on the impact of nociception on supraspinal processing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196129</link><fingerprint>e7139302</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Nathanial R.

Digital image processing is widely used in the non-destructive diagnosis of plant nutrition. Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific “dynamic features.” According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524603600000</updated><published>1524603600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</link><fingerprint>7bc6fc75</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yuanyuan Sun</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914c:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</originId><title>Survey of potential receptivity to robotic-assisted exercise coaching in a diverse sample of smokers and nonsmokers</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>Faithful inheritance of genetic information through sexual reproduction relies on the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, which, in turn, relies on the formation and repair of numerous double-strand breaks (DSBs).

The current research developed and validated a Korean-translated version of the Personal Relative Deprivation Scale (PRDS). The PRDS measures individual differences in people’s tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have. Across 2 studies, Exploratory Factor Analyses revealed that the two reverse-worded items from the original PRDS did not load onto the primary factor for the Korean-translated PRDS. A reduced 3-item Korean PRDS, however, showed good convergent validity. Replicating previous findings using Western samples, greater tendencies to make social comparisons of abilities (but not opinions) were associated with higher PRDS (Studies 1 and 2), and participants scoring higher on the 3-item Korean PRDS were more materialistic (Studies 1 and 2), reported worse physical health (Study 1), had lower self-esteem (Study 2) and experienced higher stress (Study 2).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><published>1525986000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197279</link><fingerprint>f85971fd</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Hyunji Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunji Kim, Eunbee Kim, Eunkook M.

Furthermore we see a difference in the response to infrequent dissonant stimuli in consonant standard stimuli compared to the opposite, rare consonant stimuli in dissonant standard stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67b6:91749e5b</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196176</originId><title>Mismatch negativity reflects asymmetric pre-attentive harmonic interval discrimination</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196176</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196176</canonicalUrl></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</link><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>e278b830</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d2:93d646dc</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Knowing how to prevent induced earthquakes</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.17.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health threat and cause of death worldwide.

Treatment with lysine deacetylase inhibitors (KDACi) for haematological malignancies, is accompanied by haematological side effects including thrombocytopenia, suggesting that modulation of protein acetylation affects normal myeloid development, and specifically megakaryocyte development. In the current study, utilising ex-&lt;i&gt;vivo&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of human CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells, we investigated the effects of two functionally distinct KDACi, valproic acid (VPA), and nicotinamide (NAM), on megakaryocyte differentiation, and lineage choice decisions. Treatment with VPA increased the number of megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEP), accompanied by inhibition of megakaryocyte differentiation, whereas treatment with NAM accelerated megakaryocyte development, and stimulated polyploidisation. Treatment with both KDACi resulted in no significant effects on erythrocyte differentiation, suggesting that the effects of KDACi primarily affect megakaryocyte lineage development. H3K27Ac ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed that genes involved in myeloid development, as well as megakaryocyte/erythroid (ME)-lineage differentiation are uniquely modulated by specific KDACi treatment.

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bézier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><published>1523912400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006123</link><fingerprint>19a254ec</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Stephanie A.

The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by β-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt;. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524517200000</updated><published>1524517200000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196054</link><fingerprint>fea54681</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Claudio Lamilla</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Lamilla, Douglas Braga, Rui Castro, Carolina Guimarães, Livia V.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><published>1526504400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197266</link><fingerprint>2cbc35d8</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Da Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505b:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</originId><title>Different chromatin and DNA sequence characteristics define glucocorticoid receptor binding sites that are blocked or not blocked by coregulator Hic-5</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</canonicalUrl></item><item><content><content>The structure and function of alpine grassland ecosystems, including their extensive soil carbon stocks, are largely shaped by temperature.

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min.

Background &lt;p&gt;A major feature of acute lung injury (ALI) is excessive inflammation in the lung. Vitexin is an active component from medicinal plants which has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Oxidative stress and inflammation play important roles in the pathophysiological processes in ALI. In the current study, we investigate the effect and potential mechanisms of Vitexin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;ALI was induced by LPS intratracheal instillation in C57BL/6 wild-type mice and Nrf2 gene knocked down (Nrf2-/-) mice. One hour before LPS challenge, Vitexin or vehicle intraperitoneal injection was performed. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues were examined for lung inflammation and injury at 24 h after LPS challenge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our animal study’s results showed that LPS-induced recruitment of neutrophils and elevation of proinflammatory cytokine levels were attenuated by Vitexin treatment. Vitexin decreased lung edema and alveolar protein content. Moreover, Vitexin activated nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and increased the activity of its target gene heme oxygenase (HO)-1. The LPS-induced reactive oxygen species were inhibited by Vitexin. In addition, the activation of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat PYD-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was suppressed by Vitexin. However, these effects of Vitexin were abolished in the Nrf2-/- mice. Our cell studies showed that Vitexin enhanced the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 activity. Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-1β productions were reduced in Vitexin-treated cells. However, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA in RAW cells reversed the benefit of Vitexin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Vitexin suppresses LPS-induced ALI by controlling Nrf2 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196405</link><fingerprint>9e09bae7</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Ying Lu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying Lu, Ting Yu, Jingyao Liu, Lina Gu&lt;/p&gt;

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</link><fingerprint>bf09ec4d</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Paul G.

A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee8:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</originId><title>A novel soft tissue prediction methodology for orthognathic surgery based on probabilistic finite element modelling</title><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</href></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</canonicalUrl></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-e?rss=1</link><published>1525974002000</published><fingerprint>333dc240</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-e?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Smith, K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several investigations suggest the presence of deterioration of executive function in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The study quantified executive functions in patients with FMS. A wide array of functions was assessed, including updating, shifting and inhibition, as well as decision making and mental planning. Moreover, clinical variables were investigated as possible mediators of executive dysfunction, including pain severity, psychiatric comorbidity, medication and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifty-two FMS patients and 32 healthy controls completed a battery of 14 neuropsychological tests. Clinical interviews were conducted and the McGill Pain Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Fatigue Severity Scale and Oviedo Quality of Sleep Questionnaire were presented.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patients performed poorer than controls on the Letter Number Sequencing, Arithmetic and Similarities subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Spatial Span subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, an N-back task, a verbal fluency task, the Ruff Figural Fluency Test, the Inhibition score of the Stroop Test, the Inhibition and Shifting scores of the Five Digits Test, the Key Search Test and the Zoo Map Task. Moreover, patients exhibited less steep learning curves on the Iowa Gambling Task. Among clinical variables, BMI and pain severity explained the largest proportion of performance variance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated impairments in executive functions of updating, shifting inhibition, decision making and planning in FMS. While the mediating role of pain in cognitive impairments in FMS had been previously established, the influence of BMI is a novel finding. Overweight and obesity should be considered by FMS researchers, and in the treatment of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524690000000</updated><published>1524690000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196329</link><fingerprint>2fff399b</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Cristina Muñoz Ladrón de Guevara</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Muñoz Ladrón de Guevara, María José Fernández-Serrano, Gustavo A.

Soil salinity is a common and serious environmental problem worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered as bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. However, few studies have addressed the possible benefits of AMF inoculation for medicinal plants under saline conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of colonization with two AMF, &lt;i&gt;Funneliformis mosseae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diversispora versiformis&lt;/i&gt;, alone and in combination, on the growth and nutrient uptake of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt; (Hangbaiju) in a greenhouse salt stress experiment. After 6 weeks of a non-saline pretreatment, Hangbaiju plants with and without AMF were grown for five months under salinity levels that were achieved using 0, 50 and 200 mM NaCl. Root length, shoot and root dry weight, total dry weight, and root N concentration were higher in the mycorrhizal plants than in the non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of moderate salinity, especially with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; colonization. As salinity increased, mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal dependence decreased. The enhancement of root N uptake is probably the main mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. These results suggest that the symbiotic associations between the fungus &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;morifolium&lt;/i&gt; plants may be useful in biotechnological practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196408</link><fingerprint>cf3c4c7c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Yanhong Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanhong Wang, Minqiang Wang, Yan Li, Aiping Wu, Juying Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Little is known about people’s ability to detect subclinical psychopathy from others’ quotidian social behavior, or about the correlates of variation in this ability. This study sought to address these questions using a thin slice personality judgment paradigm. We presented 108 undergraduate judges (70.4% female) with 1.5 minute video thin slices of zero-acquaintance triadic conversations among other undergraduates (targets: n = 105, 57.1% female). Judges completed self-report measures of general trust, caution, and empathy. Target individuals had completed the Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy (LSRP) scale. Judges viewed the videos in one of three conditions: complete audio, silent, or audio from which semantic content had been removed using low-pass filtering. Using a novel other-rating version of the LSRP, judges’ ratings of targets’ primary psychopathy levels were significantly positively associated with targets’ self-reports, but only in the complete audio condition. Judge general trust and target LSRP interacted, such that judges higher in general trust made less accurate judgments with respect to targets higher in primary and total psychopathy. Results are consistent with a scenario in which psychopathic traits are maintained in human populations by negative frequency dependent selection operating through the costs of detecting psychopathy in others.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525294800000</updated><published>1525294800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196729</link><fingerprint>fc0b7ccc</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Joseph H.

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524258000000</updated><published>1524258000000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</link><fingerprint>b26b5f5c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Massimo S.

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><published>1525899600000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</link><fingerprint>cd2857f3</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Caglar Senaras</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

Bacterial spot caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas arboricola&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;pruni&lt;/i&gt; (Xap) is a major threat to &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species worldwide. The molecular mechanisms of peach resistance to Xap during early leaf infection were investigated by RNA-Seq analysis of two &lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt; cultivars, ‘Redkist’ (resistant), and ‘JH Hale’ (susceptible) at 30 minutes, 1 and 3 hours-post-infection (hpi). Both cultivars exhibited extensive modulation of gene expression at 30 mpi, which reduced significantly at 1 hpi, increasing again at 3 hpi. Overall, 714 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in ‘Redkist’ (12% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 88% at 3 hpi). In ‘JH Hale’, 821 DEGs were identified (47% at 30 mpi and 1 hpi and 53% at 3 hpi). Highly up-regulated genes (fold change &gt; 100) at 3 hpi exhibited higher fold change values in ‘Redkist’ than in ‘JH Hale’. RNA-Seq bioinformatics analyses were validated by RT-qPCR. In both cultivars, DEGs included genes with putative roles in perception, signal transduction, secondary metabolism, and transcription regulation, and there were defense responses in both cultivars, with enrichment for the gene ontology terms, ‘immune system process’, ‘defense response’, and ‘cell death’. There were particular differences between the cultivars in the intensity and kinetics of modulation of expression of genes with putative roles in transcriptional activity, secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, and receptor and signaling processes. Analysis of differential exon usage (DEU) revealed that both cultivars initiated remodeling their transcriptomes at 30 mpi; however, ‘Redkist’ exhibited alternative exon usage for a greater number of genes at every time point compared with ‘JH Hale’. Candidate resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;WRKY&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;CRK&lt;/i&gt;-like, &lt;i&gt;Copper amine oxidase&lt;/i&gt;-like, and &lt;i&gt;TIR-NBS-LRR&lt;/i&gt;-like) are of interest for further functional characterization with the aim of elucidating their role in &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; spp. resistance to Xap.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1524776400000</updated><published>1524776400000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196590</link><fingerprint>d96f538c</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Fabio Gervasi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Gervasi, Patrizia Ferrante, Maria Teresa Dettori, Marco Scortichini, Ignazio Verde&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Developing more effective strategies to prevent relapse remains one of the major challenges of treating substance dependence. Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><published>1525726800000</published><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196860</link><fingerprint>a03916f1</fingerprint><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><author><name>Junkai Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junkai Wang, Yunli Fan, Yue Dong, Mengying Ma, Yuru Dong, Yajuan Niu, Yin Jiang, Hong Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Liuzhen Wu, Hongqiang Sun, Cailian Cui&lt;/p&gt;
