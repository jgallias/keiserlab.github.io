Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e28:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer L.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2335:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yong-Ju Huang, Georgia K.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ef:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Melatonin is a molecule that can enhance the resistance of plants to abiotic stress. It can alleviate the damage of heavy metal ions, and other chemical substances, changes in temperature and humidity, oxidative stress in higher plants, and enhance resistance of plants to abiotic stress. The transformation of N-Acetyl-5-hydroxy tryptamin into melatonin requires the involvement of methyltransferase. In this study, a methyltransferase gene &lt;i&gt;ZjOMT&lt;/i&gt; has been cloned from &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;. The gene was induced by aluminum (Al) stress in the leaves and roots of &lt;i&gt;Zoysia japonica&lt;/i&gt;, and was up-regulated by 20.86- and 31.18-folds, respectively. The expression of ZjOMT in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; increased the content of melatonin by about 8-fold in the recombinant strain compared with that of the empty vector strain. Al resistance test showed that the resistance of recombinant strain BL21-pET32-ZjOMT to Al was significantly higher than that of the empty vector strain BL21-pET32. The survival rate of the recombinant strain expressing ZjOMT was about 100-fold higher than that of the empty vector strain when treated with 0.35 mM Al. These findings suggest that the heterologous expression of ZjOMT improved the resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; to Al by increasing the content of melatonin.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42262:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongsong Luo, Chunyan He, Liebao Han&lt;/p&gt;

By extracting and extending this information (using the overlaps of the reads), the haplotypes of an individual can be obtained.

During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636f3e460d:51f32:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) were used to evaluate trophic niche overlap between two filter-feeding fishes (known together as bigheaded carp) native to China, silver carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&lt;/i&gt;) and bighead carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys nobilis&lt;/i&gt;), and three native filter-feeding fish including bigmouth buffalo (&lt;i&gt;Ictiobus cyprinellus&lt;/i&gt;), gizzard shad (&lt;i&gt;Dorosoma cepedianum&lt;/i&gt;) and paddlefish (&lt;i&gt;Polyodon spathula&lt;/i&gt;) in the lower Missouri River, USA, using the Bayesian Stable Isotope in R statistics. Results indicate that except for bigmouth buffalo, all species displayed similar trophic niche size and trophic diversity. Bigmouth buffalo occupied a small trophic niche and had the greatest trophic overlap with silver carp (93.6%) and bighead carp (94.1%) followed by gizzard shad (91.0%). Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish. Average niche overlap between silver carp and native species was as high as 71%, greater than niche overlap between bighead carp and native fish (64%). Our findings indicate that bigheaded carps are a potential threat to a diverse and stable native fish community.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761231:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianzhu Wang, Duane Chapman, Jun Xu, Yang Wang, Binhe Gu&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs. Over the course of evolution, many new miRNAs are known to have emerged and added to the existing miRNA repertoires of drosophilids and vertebrates. Despite the large number of miRNAs in existence, the complementary pairing of only ~7 bases between miRNAs and mRNAs is sufficient to induce repression. Thus, miRNA targeting is so widespread that genes coexpressed with a miRNA have evolved to avoid sites that are targeted by the miRNA. Besides this avoidance, little is known about the preferential modes of miRNA targeting. Therefore, to elucidate miRNA targeting preference and avoidance, we evaluated the bias of the number of miRNA targeting occurrences in relation to expression intensities of miRNAs and their coexpressed target mRNAs by surveying transcriptome data from human organs. We found that miRNAs preferentially target genes with intermediate levels of expression, while avoiding highly expressed ones, and that older miRNAs have greater targeting specificity, suggesting that specificity increases during the course of evolution.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ec:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hisakazu Iwama, Kiyohito Kato, Hitomi Imachi, Koji Murao, Tsutomu Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we report a detailed experimental, binding free energy calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation investigation of the interactions of carboxylic-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-f-MWCNTs) with porcine trypsin (pTry). The enzyme exhibits decreased thermostability at 330K in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. Furthermore, the activity of pTry also decreases in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. The restricted diffusion of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme was observed in the experiment. The MD simulation analysis suggested that this could be because of the blocking of the S1 pocket of pTry, which plays a vital role in the substrate selectivity. The intrinsic fluorescence of pTry is quenched with increase in the COOH-f-MWCNTs concentration. Circular dichroism (CD) and UV–visible absorption spectroscopies indicate the ability of COOH-f-MWCNTs to experience conformational change in the native structure of the enzyme. The binding free energy calculations also show that electrostatics, π-cation, and π-π stacking interactions play important roles in the binding of the carboxylated CNTs with pTry. The MD simulation results demonstrated that the carboxylated CNTs adsorb to the enzyme stronger than the CNT without the–COOH groups. Our observations can provide an example of the nanoscale toxicity of COOH-f-MWCNTs for proteins, which is a critical issue for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; application of COOH-f-MWCNTs.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf9:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Noordadi, Faramarz Mehrnejad, Reza H.

Tether proteins attach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other cellular membranes, thereby creating contact sites that are proposed to form platforms for regulating lipid homeostasis and facilitating non-vesicular lipid exchange. Sterols are synthesized in the ER and transported by non-vesicular mechanisms to the plasma membrane (PM), where they represent almost half of all PM lipids and contribute critically to the barrier function of the PM. To determine whether contact sites are important for both sterol exchange between the ER and PM and intermembrane regulation of lipid metabolism, we generated Δ-super-tether (Δ-s-tether) yeast cells that lack six previously identified tethering proteins (yeast extended synatotagmin [E-Syt], vesicle-associated membrane protein [VAMP]-associated protein [VAP], and TMEM16-anoctamin homologues) as well as the presumptive tether Ice2. Despite the lack of ER-PM contacts in these cells, ER-PM sterol exchange is robust, indicating that the sterol transport machinery is either absent from or not uniquely located at contact sites. Unexpectedly, we found that the transport of exogenously supplied sterol to the ER occurs more slowly in Δ-s-tether cells than in wild-type (WT) cells. We pinpointed this defect to changes in sterol organization and transbilayer movement within the PM bilayer caused by phospholipid dysregulation, evinced by changes in the abundance and organization of PM lipids. Indeed, deletion of either &lt;i&gt;OSH4&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sterol/phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) exchange protein, or &lt;i&gt;SAC1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a PI4P phosphatase, caused synthetic lethality in Δ-s-tether cells due to disruptions in redundant PI4P and phospholipid regulatory pathways. The growth defect of Δ-s-tether cells was rescued with an artificial &amp;quot;ER-PM staple,&amp;quot; a tether assembled from unrelated non-yeast protein domains, indicating that endogenous tether proteins have nonspecific bridging functions. Finally, we discovered that sterols play a role in regulating ER-PM contact site formation. In sterol-depleted cells, levels of the yeast E-Syt tether Tcb3 were induced and ER-PM contact increased dramatically. These results support a model in which ER-PM contact sites provide a nexus for coordinating the complex interrelationship between sterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids that maintain PM composition and integrity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OHq9avpWuLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16383d04459:d57e0:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Evan Quon, Yves Y.

Unexpectedly, we found that the transport of exogenously supplied sterol to the ER occurs more slowly in Δ-s-tether cells than in wild-type (WT) cells. We pinpointed this defect to changes in sterol organization and transbilayer movement within the PM bilayer caused by phospholipid dysregulation, evinced by changes in the abundance and organization of PM lipids. Indeed, deletion of either &lt;i&gt;OSH4&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sterol/phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) exchange protein, or &lt;i&gt;SAC1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a PI4P phosphatase, caused synthetic lethality in Δ-s-tether cells due to disruptions in redundant PI4P and phospholipid regulatory pathways. The growth defect of Δ-s-tether cells was rescued with an artificial &amp;quot;ER-PM staple,&amp;quot; a tether assembled from unrelated non-yeast protein domains, indicating that endogenous tether proteins have nonspecific bridging functions. Finally, we discovered that sterols play a role in regulating ER-PM contact site formation. In sterol-depleted cells, levels of the yeast E-Syt tether Tcb3 were induced and ER-PM contact increased dramatically. These results support a model in which ER-PM contact sites provide a nexus for coordinating the complex interrelationship between sterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids that maintain PM composition and integrity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OHq9avpWuLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34815</link><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34815</originId><author><name>andreas.winkler@tugraz.at (Andreas Winkler)</name></author><crawled>1528199470226</crawled><description>Organisms adapt to environmental cues using diverse signaling networks.

Enzastaurin is a Protein Kinase C-β selective inhibitor that was developed to treat cancers. Protein Kinase C-β is an important enzyme for a variety of neuronal functions; in particular, previous rodent studies have reported deficits in spatial and fear-conditioned learning and memory with lower levels of Protein Kinase C-β. Due to Enzastaurin’s mechanism of action, the present study investigated the consequences of Enzastaurin exposure on learning and memory in 12-month-old Fischer-344 male rats. Rats were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or Enzastaurin, and behaviorally tested using the spatial reference memory Morris Water Maze. Rats treated with Enzastaurin exhibited decreased overnight retention and poorer performance on the latter testing day, indicating a mild, but significant, memory impairment. There were no differences during the probe trial indicating that all animals were able to spatially localize the platform to the proper quadrant by the end of testing. RNA isolated from the hippocampus was analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina). No statistically significant transcriptional differences were noted. Our findings suggest that acute Enzastaurin treatment can impair hippocampal-based learning and memory performance, with no effects on transcription in the hippocampus. We propose that care should be taken in future clinical trials that utilize Protein Kinase C-ß inhibitors, to monitor for possible cognitive effects, future research should examine if these effects are fully reversible.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc6:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mari N.

In precision medicine, especially in clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as well as disease ontologies like the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are often used for deep phenotyping of patients and coding of clinical diagnoses. However, the process of assigning ontology classes (annotating) to patient descriptions is often disconnected from the process of writing patient reports or manuscripts in word processing software such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. To improve this situation, we present Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a well-established, actively developed citation management software to generate a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within clinical reports or manuscripts at the time of writing. We expect this approach to decrease the additional workload to a minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. Standardised collection of phenotypic information at the time of describing the patient allows for streamlining of clinic workflow, efficient data entry, and will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis, remove ambiguousness from manuscripts, and allow sharing of anonymised patient phenotype data with ultimate goal of a better understanding of the disease. Thus, we hope that our integrated approach will further promote the usage of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the clinical setting and in the biomedical domain.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636aa4cde4:440c8e7:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Controlled vocabularies and ontologies have become a valuable resource for knowledge representation, data integration, and downstream analyses in the biomedical domain. In precision medicine, especially in clinical genetics, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) as well as disease ontologies like the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are often used for deep phenotyping of patients and coding of clinical diagnoses. However, the process of assigning ontology classes (annotating) to patient descriptions is often disconnected from the process of writing patient reports or manuscripts in word processing software such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice. This additional workload and the requirement to install dedicated software may discourage usage of ontologies for parts of the target audience. To improve this situation, we present Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a well-established, actively developed citation management software to generate a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within clinical reports or manuscripts at the time of writing. We expect this approach to decrease the additional workload to a minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. Standardised collection of phenotypic information at the time of describing the patient allows for streamlining of clinic workflow, efficient data entry, and will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis, remove ambiguousness from manuscripts, and allow sharing of anonymised patient phenotype data with ultimate goal of a better understanding of the disease. Thus, we hope that our integrated approach will further promote the usage of ontologies and controlled vocabularies in the clinical setting and in the biomedical domain.</content></content></item><item><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13571</link><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13571</originId><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><crawled>1527686477007</crawled><description>If you get your biomedical breaking news from the British press, you will have heard all about a very promising vaccine treatment for glioblastoma.

That would be good news, because that’s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/20/glioblastoma-is-bad-news-period&quot;&gt;terrible diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; with very little in the way of effective treatment. But if you get your breaking biomedical news from the British press, then I am very sorry for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because this is DCVax, from Northwest Biotherapeutics. And this vaccine has been twisting and turning through the clinic for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/brain-cancer-vaccine-tessa-jowell-tumour-patients-clinical-trial-a8374886.html&quot;&gt;ten years now&lt;/a&gt;, under circumstances more suited for a soap opera than for a biotech company. I’m not sure I can summarize it all – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/special-report/7-northwest-biotherapeutics&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/14072951/1/northwest-bio-executive-pleads-ignorance-about-clinical-trial-halt-stock-collapse.html&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; reprising the story as of last year, so start there. (If you’re a Stat Plus subscriber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/15/northwest-bio-clinical-trial/&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;). There have been financial troubles, allegations and investigations, clinical holds, claims and counterclaims – and through it all, the one constant has been the NWBO has &lt;em&gt;never been able to explain to anyone&lt;/em&gt; quite what is going on. That even goes for questions like “Why did regulatory agencies put a hold on your trial?”, “Why haven’t you enrolled the number of patients you said you would?”, and “When will you have actual data to present?” Minor stuff. At one point, the company actually attempted to explain a delay by saying that members of its management team had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/09/29/the_case_of_northwest_biotherapeutics&quot;&gt;last wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the company in 2014, during yet another bizarre development. That was when a Washington Post columnist went after Adam Feuerstein (then with TheStreet.com) for being part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-a-washington-post-columnist-takes-aim-at-shortsellers-but-misfires-20140929-column.html&quot;&gt;conspiracy of evil short-sellers&lt;/a&gt; trying to harm this innocent little company. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestreet.com/story/12929412/1/washington-posts-pearlstein-didnt-intend-to-disparage-thestreets-integrity.html&quot;&gt;letter of apology&lt;/a&gt; was eventually produced, albeit a carefully worded and rather lawyerly one, and I would submit that the subsequent history of NWBO illustrates that no evil conspiracy has been required. They were delisted from the NASDAQ, for example, and have been trading as a penny stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-018-1507-6&quot;&gt;has now published&lt;/a&gt; some analysis of the interim data, but as that Stat Plus piece makes clear, this is not really a satisfactory way of handling things. The company itself says that it has not reached the number of overall-survival cases that it needs to declare the trial finished, so the data are supposed to still be completely blinded. Because of the trial’s crossover design (patients getting standard of care could later on receive DCvax if the glioblastoma recurred, which it almost always does), about 90% of the trial’s participants have ended up getting the vaccine. That sounds like it’s going to make the workup of the data rather complicated, and it could also make the actual comparison to standard of care tricky as well. The current paper doesn’t address these questions, because it can’t, other than to say that since the great majority of the patients got the vaccine anyway, hey, let’s just look at the still-blinded data and run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They expect to hit their overall number later this summer, and at that point they’ll start working through the data. The company has already warned investors that this could take many months, so it’s anyone’s guess when we’ll see the actual results. No celebrations should take place until that occurs. The entire dendritic-cell-vaccine idea that the company is working on has been kicking around for at least twenty years now, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendreon&quot;&gt;little success&lt;/a&gt;, and DCVax itself first entered the clinic in 2002. The company has also worked on a prostate cancer vaccine using the same methods, but although a Phase II trial completed about ten years ago, they have never been able to partner it with anyone to go into Phase III. Couple this with the extremely aggressive and constantly changing nature of glioblastoma itself, and it’s hard to be optimistic. Unless you read the British papers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00218</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00218</originId><author><name>Bryan H.

We show that dendritic cells (DCs) from patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from patients without CD but bearing a high-risk allele (rs11564258) at this locus as heterozygotes exhibited increased LRRK2 expression in vitro. To investigate the immunological consequences of this increased LRRK2 expression, we conducted studies in transgenic mice overexpressing &lt;i&gt;Lrrk2&lt;/i&gt; and showed that these mice exhibited more severe colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) than did littermate control animals. This increase in colitis severity was associated with lamina propria DCs that showed increased Dectin-1–induced NF-B activation and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Colitis severity was driven by LRRK2 activation of NF-B pathway components including the TAK1 complex and TRAF6. Next, we found that membrane-associated LRRK2 (in association with TAB2) caused inactivation of Beclin-1 and inhibition of autophagy. HCT116 colon epithelial cells lacking Beclin-1 exhibited increased LRRK2 expression compared to wild-type cells, suggesting that inhibition of autophagy potentially could augment LRRK2 proinflammatory signaling. We then showed that LRRK2 inhibitors decreased Dectin-1–induced TNF-α production by mouse DCs and ameliorated DSS-induced colitis, both in control and &lt;i&gt;Lrrk2&lt;/i&gt; transgenic animals. Finally, we demonstrated that LRRK2 inhibitors blocked TNF-α production by cultured DCs from patients with CD.

Here we leveraged systems biology approaches to assess the target tissues, molecular pathways, and gene regulatory networks associated with prenatal exposure to the model EDC Bisphenol A (BPA). Prenatal BPA exposure led to scores of transcriptomic and methylomic alterations in the adipose, hypothalamus, and liver tissues in mouse offspring, with cross-tissue perturbations in lipid metabolism as well as tissue-specific alterations in histone subunits, glucose metabolism and extracellular matrix. Network modeling prioritized main molecular targets of BPA, including Pparg, Hnf4a, Esr1, and Fasn. Lastly, integrative analyses identified the association of BPA molecular signatures with cardiometabolic phenotypes in mouse and human. Our multi-tissue, multi-omics investigation provides strong evidence that BPA perturbs diverse molecular networks in central and peripheral tissues, and offers insights into the molecular targets that link BPA to human cardiometabolic disorders.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163c75839cf:47c6bb0:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The health impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) remain debated and their tissue and molecular targets are poorly understood.

Our multi-tissue, multi-omics investigation provides strong evidence that BPA perturbs diverse molecular networks in central and peripheral tissues, and offers insights into the molecular targets that link BPA to human cardiometabolic disorders.</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338319v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338319v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Wen, X.</name></author><crawled>1528154613113</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338319v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>301d8218</fingerprint><published>1528095600000</published><title>Efficient inference of single cell expression profiles with overlapping pooling and compressed sensing [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/04/338319</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Plate-based single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) methods can detect a comprehensive profile for gene expression but suffers from high library cost of each single cell.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the human porphyrias, arises from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with PCT. While these observations implicate HCV infection as a risk factor for PCT pathogenesis, the mechanism of interaction between the virus and porphyrin metabolism is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of HCV core protein on intracellular porphyrin metabolism to elucidate the link between HCV infection and PCT. The accumulation and excretion of porphyrins after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a porphyrin precursor, were compared between cells stably expressing HCV core protein and controls. Cells expressing HCV core protein had lower amounts of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and heme and had higher amounts of excreted coproporphyrin III, the oxidized form of coproporphyrinogen III, compared with controls. These observations suggest that HCV core protein affects porphyrin metabolism and facilitates the export of excess coproporphyrinogen III and/or coproporphyrin III, possibly via porphyrin transporters. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the presence of HCV core protein increased the mRNA expression of porphyrin exporters ABCG2 and FLVCR1. Western blot analysis showed a higher expression level of FLVCR1, but not ABCG2, as well as a higher expression level of mature ALAS1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, in HCV core protein-expressing cells compared with controls. The data indicate that HCV core protein induced abnormal intracellular porphyrin metabolism, with an over-excretion of coproporphyrin III. These findings may partially account for the susceptibility of HCV-infected individuals to PCT development.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84548:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takafumi Nakano, Kyoji Moriya, Kazuhiko Koike, Toshiharu Horie&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil. WT mice showed compensatory hyperproliferation as a sign of regeneration in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide rescued the body weight of the Tg mice and led to a hyperproliferation in the small intestine, whereas single treatment was less effective.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The ablation of L-cells leads to severe mucositis and insufficient intestinal healing, shown by severe body weight loss and lack of compensatory hyperproliferation in the recovery phase. Co-treatment with exendin-4 and teduglutide could prevent this.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Mucositis is a side effect of chemotherapy seen in the digestive tract, with symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, inflammation and ulcerations. Our aim was to investigate whether endogenous glucagon-like peptide -1 and -2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are implicated in intestinal healing after chemotherapy-induced mucositis.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We used a transgenic mouse model Tg(GCG.DTR)(Tg) expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor in the proglucagon-producing cells. Injections with diphtheria toxin ablated the GLP-1 and GLP-2 producing L-cells in Tg mice with no effect in wild-type (WT) mice. Mice were injected with 5-fluorouracil or saline and received vehicle, exendin-4, teduglutide (gly2-GLP-2), or exendin-4/teduglutide in combination. The endpoints were body weight change, small intestinal weight, morphology, histological scoring of mucositis and myeloperoxidase levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ablation of L-cells led to impaired GLP-2 secretion; increased loss of body weight; lower small intestinal weight; lower crypt depth, villus height and mucosal area; and increased the mucositis severity score in mice given 5-fluorouracil.

The S1 prime and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though.

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance).

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85435:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

The ability of a wide range of psychological and actuarial measures to characterize crimes in the prison population has not yet been compared in a single study. Our main objective was to determine if the discriminant capacity of psychological measures (PM) and actuarial data (AD) varies according to the crime. An Ecuadorian sample of 576 men convicted of Robbery, Murder, Rape and Drug Possession crimes was evaluated through an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire, prison files and the Spanish adaptation of the Personality Assessment Inventory. Discriminant analysis was used to establish, for each crime, the discriminant capacity and the classification accuracy of a model composed of AD (socio-demographic and judicial measures) and a second model incorporating PM. The AD showed a superior discriminant capacity, whilst the contribution of both types of measures varied according to the crime. The PM generated some increase in the correct classification percentages for Murder, Rape and Drug Possession, but their contribution was zero for the crime of Robbery. Specific profiles of each crime were obtained from the strongest significant correlations between the value of each explanatory variable and the probability of belonging to the crime. The AD model is more robust when these four crimes are characterized. The contribution of AD and PM depends on the crime, and the inclusion of PM in actuarial models moderately optimizes the classification accuracy of Murder, Rape, and Drug Possession crimes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4e:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Burneo-Garcés, Manuel Fernández-Alcántara, Agar Marín-Morales, Miguel Pérez-García&lt;/p&gt;

An early prediction of complex disorders can have a significant impact on increasing the effectiveness of interventions and treatments in improving the prognosis and, in many cases, enhancing the quality of life in the affected patients. Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders in subset of affected samples. We provide a novel formulation for the Ultra-Accurate Disorder Prediction (UADP) problem and develop a combinatorial framework for solving this problem. The primary goal of this framework, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), is to make prediction for a subset of affected cases while having very low false positive rate prediction for unaffected samples. Note that in the Odin framework we will take advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8\% of autism cases without a sever variant in a known recurrent mutated genes with a less than 1% false positive rate. Furthermore, Odin predicted a set of 391 genes that severe variants in these genes can cause autism or other developmental delay disorders.

Considering the genetic heritability of neurodevelopmental disorders, we are proposing a novel framework for utilizing rare coding variation for early prediction of these disorders in subset of affected samples. We provide a novel formulation for the Ultra-Accurate Disorder Prediction (UADP) problem and develop a combinatorial framework for solving this problem. The primary goal of this framework, denoted as Odin (Oracle for DIsorder predictioN), is to make prediction for a subset of affected cases while having very low false positive rate prediction for unaffected samples. Note that in the Odin framework we will take advantage of the available functional information (e.g., pairwise coexpression of genes during brain development) to increase the prediction power beyond genes with recurrent variants. Application of our method accurately recovers an additional 8\% of autism cases without a sever variant in a known recurrent mutated genes with a less than 1% false positive rate. Furthermore, Odin predicted a set of 391 genes that severe variants in these genes can cause autism or other developmental delay disorders.

In this study, we elaborated a novel deep neural networks (DNN) model for predicting stable or unstable structural states of mRNA in vivo by fitting six quantifiable features of mRNA structure: ribosome density, minimum free energy, GC content, mRNA abundance, ribosomal initial density and structural relative position. By mutations simulation and well-trained, high-precision models prediction, we discovered the unique effects of these six mRNA structural features on the structural stability of mRNA in vivo. It was worthwhile to point out that we have found a double-sided effect of ribosomal density on the structural stability of mRNA, and it may be speculated that, more stable mRNA structure leaded to higher ribosome density in the region of low ribosomal density and higher ribosomal density resulted in more unstable mRNA structure in the region of high ribosome density.Additionally, the trend and extent of these six features affecting mRNA structural stability in vivo could also be accurately predicted by the DNN model. This is the first time to use DNN method to decipher the difference of mRNA structure in vivo and in vitro, and a good prediction results have been acquired, revealing a &amp;quot;personally&amp;quot; impact of different mRNA structural features on its stability quantitatively.

In this study, we elaborated a novel deep neural networks (DNN) model for predicting stable or unstable structural states of mRNA in vivo by fitting six quantifiable features of mRNA structure: ribosome density, minimum free energy, GC content, mRNA abundance, ribosomal initial density and structural relative position. By mutations simulation and well-trained, high-precision models prediction, we discovered the unique effects of these six mRNA structural features on the structural stability of mRNA in vivo.

Background &lt;p&gt;Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a high throughput technique that measures absorbance of specific wavelengths of light by biological samples and uses this information to classify the age of lab-reared mosquitoes as younger or older than seven days with an average accuracy greater than 80%. For NIRS to estimate ages of wild mosquitoes, a sample of wild mosquitoes with known age in days would be required to train and test the model. Mark-release-recapture is the most reliable method to produce wild-caught mosquitoes of known age in days. However, it is logistically demanding, time inefficient, subject to low recapture rates, and raises ethical issues due to the release of mosquitoes. Using labels from Detinova dissection results in a mathematical model with poor accuracy. Alternatively, a model trained on spectra from laboratory-reared mosquitoes where age in days is known can be applied to estimate the age of wild mosquitoes, but this would be appropriate only if spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes are similar.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 2) cluster analysis on a mixture of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild &lt;i&gt;Anopheles arabiensis&lt;/i&gt; to determine if there is any significant difference between these two groups. While controlling the numbers of mosquitoes included in the model at each age, we found two clusters with no significant difference in distribution of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild mosquitoes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.25). We repeated the analysis using hierarchical clustering, and similarly, no significant difference was observed (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.13).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We find no difference between spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes of the same age and species.

Moreover, the phenotypic associations of these driver genes are poorly understood. This report aims to reveal the phenotypic impacts of a group of consensus driver genes in HCC. We used MutSigCV and OncodriveFM modules implemented in the IntOGen pipeline to identify consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts comprising 1,494 samples in total. To access their global impacts, we used TCGA mutations and copy number variations to predict the transcriptomics data, under generalized linear models. We further investigated the associations of the consensus driver genes to patient survival, age, gender, race and risk factors. We identify 10 consensus driver genes across six HCC cohorts in total. Integrative analysis of driver mutations, copy number variations and transcriptomic data reveals that these consensus driver mutations and their copy number variations are associated with majority (62.5%) of the mRNA transcriptome, but only a small fraction (8.9%) of miRNAs. Genes associated with TP53, CTNNB1, and ARID1A mutations contribute to the tripod of most densely connected pathway clusters. These driver genes are significantly associated with patients&apos; overall survival. Some driver genes are significantly linked to HCC gender (CTNNB1, ALB, TP53 and AXIN1), race (TP53 and CDKN2A), and age (RB1) disparities. This study prioritizes a group of consensus drivers in HCC, which collectively show vast impacts on the phenotypes.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity.

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, as a model spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium, has been extensively used for spore germination research. Within this field, nutrient-dependent germination with specific germinant receptors (GerA, responding to L-alanine or L-valine; GerB and GerK, acting together to start spore germination process in response to AGFK) has been the most studied. There are three different variants of the GerAA subunit (299T/302S, 299A/302P, 299A/302S) of the GerA germination receptor present in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; subs. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; laboratory strains. According to our research, the 299A/302P one, unlike the others, interferes with the spore’s ability to germinate in L-alanine as assessed by the measurement of DPA release upon stimulation with the germinant. Multiple genetic manipulations described in this work followed by spore germination tests, together with secondary structure predictions led us to the following conclusions. First, position 302 of GerAA protein is crucial in terms of GerA germination receptor functionality; a proline residue at this position renders the GerA receptor non-functional, most probably due to a change in the protein secondary structure. Second, the 302P GerAA variant has most probably an impaired affinity to other components of GerA receptor. Together, these may explain the loss of GerA receptor’s function. Analysis of the GerAA protein should get us closer to understanding the mechanism of GerA receptor function.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bfa:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Grela, Inga Jamrożek, Marta Hubisz, Adam Iwanicki, Krzysztof Hinc, Rajmund Kaźmierkiewicz, Michał Obuchowski&lt;/p&gt;

4′-cyano-2′-deoxyinosine (SK14-061a), a novel nucleoside analog based on inosine, has antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that has the ability to acquire resistance against many types of reverse transcriptase inhibitors based on nucleosides. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics studies after its oral administration to rats. For this purpose, we first developed and validated an analytical method for quantitatively determining SK14-061a levels in biological samples by a UPLC system interfaced with a TOF-MS system. A rapid, simple and selective method for the quantification of SK14-061a in biological samples was established using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with solid phase extraction. The pharmacokinetic properties of SK14-061a in rats after oral administration were then evaluated using this LC-MS method. SK14-061a was found to be relatively highly bioavailable, is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract, and is then mainly distributed to the liver and then ultimately excreted via the urine in an unchanged form. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of SK14-061a with the nucleoside analog, entecavir, led to a significant alteration in the pharmacokinetics of SK14-061a. These results suggest that the SK14-061a has favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a high bioavailability with the potential for use in oral pharmaceutical formulations, but drug-drug interactions should also be considered.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f56:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Hashimoto, Kazuaki Taguchi, Takako Ishiguro, Satoru Kohgo, Shuhei Imoto, Keishi Yamasaki, Hiroaki Mitsuya, Masaki Otagiri&lt;/p&gt;

Division of labor and task specialization explain the success of human and insect societies. Social insect colonies are characterized by division of labor, with workers specializing in brood care early and foraging later in life. Theory posits that this task switching requires shifts in responsiveness to task-related cues, yet experimental evidence is weak. Here, we show that a &lt;i&gt;Vitellogenin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt;) ortholog identified in an RNAseq study on the ant &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longispinosus&lt;/i&gt; is involved in this process: using phylogenetic analyses of &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vg-like&lt;/i&gt; genes, we firstly show that this candidate gene does not cluster with the intensively studied honey bee &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; but falls into a separate &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; cluster. Secondly, an experimental knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; in the fat body caused a reduction in brood care and an increase in nestmate care in young ant workers. Nestmate care is normally exhibited by older workers. We demonstrate experimentally that this task switch is at least partly based on &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt;–associated shifts in responsiveness from brood to worker cues. We thus reveal a novel mechanism leading to early behavioral maturation via changes in social cue responsiveness mediated by &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; and associated pathways, which proximately play a role in regulating division of labor.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J7jiux0QQSI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163d63278a7:1af177:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philip Kohlmeier, Barbara Feldmeyer, Susanne Foitzik&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we show that a &lt;i&gt;Vitellogenin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt;) ortholog identified in an RNAseq study on the ant &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longispinosus&lt;/i&gt; is involved in this process: using phylogenetic analyses of &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vg-like&lt;/i&gt; genes, we firstly show that this candidate gene does not cluster with the intensively studied honey bee &lt;i&gt;Vg&lt;/i&gt; but falls into a separate &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; cluster. Secondly, an experimental knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; in the fat body caused a reduction in brood care and an increase in nestmate care in young ant workers. Nestmate care is normally exhibited by older workers. We demonstrate experimentally that this task switch is at least partly based on &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt;–associated shifts in responsiveness from brood to worker cues. We thus reveal a novel mechanism leading to early behavioral maturation via changes in social cue responsiveness mediated by &lt;i&gt;Vg-like A&lt;/i&gt; and associated pathways, which proximately play a role in regulating division of labor.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J7jiux0QQSI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5</originId><author><name>Patrick M.

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4225f:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Duong H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Chinese parents have access to domestic and foreign vaccines for their children. Their vaccine preferences are unclear, especially given recent pharmaceutical quality scandals and widely held beliefs deriving from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This study characterized parental beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of Chinese and foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, caregivers of young children at public immunization clinics in Shanghai, China, responded to a survey on vaccine perceptions. The two outcomes (differential belief in the effectiveness and safety of foreign vs domestic vaccines) were separately regressed onto demographic predictors in multinomial logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 618 caregivers, 56% thought the effectiveness of domestic and foreign vaccines were comparable; 33% thought domestic were more effective and 11% foreign. Two-thirds thought foreign and domestic vaccines had similar safety; 11% thought domestic were safer and 21% thought foreign were safer. Compared to college graduates, those with a high school education or less had greater odds of believing domestic vaccines were more effective, and also had greater odds of believing imported vaccines were safer. Greater trust in TCM was not associated with differential beliefs in the effectiveness or safety of domestic vs foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that foreign and domestic vaccines differ in either effectiveness or safety, less educated caregivers in China (but not those with greater trust in TCM) appear to believe such differences exist.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate methods and processes for timely, efficient and good quality peer review of research funding proposals in health.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A two-stage evidence synthesis: (1) a systematic map to describe the key characteristics of the evidence base, followed by (2) a systematic review of the studies stakeholders prioritised as relevant from the map on the effectiveness and efficiency of peer review ‘innovations’. Standard processes included literature searching, duplicate inclusion criteria screening, study keyword coding, data extraction, critical appraisal and study synthesis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 83 studies from 15 countries were included in the systematic map. The evidence base is diverse, investigating many aspects of the systems for, and processes of, peer review. The systematic review included eight studies from Australia, Canada, and the USA, evaluating a broad range of peer review innovations. These studies showed that simplifying the process by shortening proposal forms, using smaller reviewer panels, or expediting processes can speed up the review process and reduce costs, but this might come at the expense of peer review quality, a key aspect that has not been assessed. Virtual peer review using videoconferencing or teleconferencing appears promising for reducing costs by avoiding the need for reviewers to travel, but again any consequences for quality have not been adequately assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is increasing international research activity into the peer review of health research funding. The studies reviewed had methodological limitations and variable generalisability to research funders. Given these limitations it is not currently possible to recommend immediate implementation of these innovations. However, many appear promising based on existing evidence, and could be adapted as necessary by funders and evaluated. Where feasible, experimental evaluation, including randomised controlled trials, should be conducted, evaluating impact on effectiveness, efficiency and quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Shepherd, Geoff K.

Given these limitations it is not currently possible to recommend immediate implementation of these innovations. However, many appear promising based on existing evidence, and could be adapted as necessary by funders and evaluated. Where feasible, experimental evaluation, including randomised controlled trials, should be conducted, evaluating impact on effectiveness, efficiency and quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</originId><author><name>Akram El Kateb</name></author><updated>1526590800000</updated><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8f44eb7</fingerprint><published>1526590800000</published><title>Impact of industrial phosphate waste discharge on the marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia)</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and “clean” adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85440:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d25:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;A number of video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the most crucial finding of subsequent aspiration pneumonia has not been validated fully. We conducted a retrospective and case-control study to determine the clinically significant VFSS findings in this population, and to propose a practical scale for predicting aspiration pneumonia in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled 184 PD patients who underwent VFSS because of suspected dysphagia. The patients who developed aspiration pneumonia within six months of the VFSS were assigned as cases and the patients without aspiration pneumonia at six months were designated as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the prognostic VFSS features based on the data of swallowing 3 mL of jelly, which were used to make a PD VFSS scale (PDVFS). The validity of the new PDVFS was evaluated by ROC analysis. Additionally, we used the survival time analysis to compare time to death between groups, stratified by the PDVFS score.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five patients developed aspiration pneumonia. Among the previously-proposed VFSS features, mastication, lingual motility prior to transfer, aspiration, and total swallow time were identified as significant prognostic factors. We combined these factors to form the PDVFS. The PDVFS score ranges from 0 to 12, with 12 being the worst. ROC analysis revealed 92% sensitivity and 82% specificity at a cutoff point of 3. The higher PDVFS group showed shorter time-to-death than the lower PDVFS group (log rank P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our newly developed VFSS severity scale (based on jelly swallowing) for patients with PD was easy to rate and could predict subsequent aspiration pneumonia and poor prognosis in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f3f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Satoshi Tomita, Tomoko Oeda, Atsushi Umemura, Masayuki Kohsaka, Kwiyoung Park, Kenji Yamamoto, Hiroshi Sugiyama, Hideyuki Sawada&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFβ-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFβ-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFβ-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFβ-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFβ-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties. RT can impact opposite ends of the patella tendon force-elongation relationship in each sex.

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by inter-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163846dad2c:e40dc:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506d:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

By using the domain-specific ontology in addition to word embeddings and WordNet, BO-LSTM improved both the F1-score of the detection and classification of drug-drug interactions, particularly in a document set with a limited number of annotations.

White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-β receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd74:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mike Jager, Mi-Jeong Lee, Chendi Li, Stephen R.

Background &lt;p&gt;The weekend effect describes a phenomenon whereby patients admitted to hospitals on weekends are at higher risk of complications compared to those admitted during weekdays.

Background &lt;p&gt;Recent studies showed that increased fresh fruit consumption is significantly associated with lower risks of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); other studies suggested that albuminuria is associated with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD. Therefore, we hypothesized that lower fresh fruit consumption is associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria among Chinese adults in rural areas, where fresh fruit consumption level is very low and prevalence of albuminuria is high.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis in a village-based cohort study of 3574 participants aged ≥ 30 years from the Handan Eye Study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 35.4% of the participants never or rarely consumed fresh fruits, and 33.9, 21.6, and 9.1% consumed fresh fruits 1–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week, and ≥ 3 times/week, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, albuminuria developed in 17.6% (n = 629) of the participants. Compared with participants who consumed fresh fruits ≥ 3 times/week, the multivariable adjustment odds ratios (ORs) for incident albuminuria associated with fruit consumption 1–2 times/week, 1–3 times/month, and no or rare consumption were 1.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.05–2.40), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17–2.58), and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.20–2.64), respectively.

Background &lt;p&gt;Recent studies showed that increased fresh fruit consumption is significantly associated with lower risks of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD); other studies suggested that albuminuria is associated with diabetes, hypertension, and CVD. Therefore, we hypothesized that lower fresh fruit consumption is associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria among Chinese adults in rural areas, where fresh fruit consumption level is very low and prevalence of albuminuria is high.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We tested the hypothesis in a village-based cohort study of 3574 participants aged ≥ 30 years from the Handan Eye Study conducted from 2006 to 2013. Albuminuria was defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 35.4% of the participants never or rarely consumed fresh fruits, and 33.9, 21.6, and 9.1% consumed fresh fruits 1–3 times/month, 1–2 times/week, and ≥ 3 times/week, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 5.6 years, albuminuria developed in 17.6% (n = 629) of the participants. Compared with participants who consumed fresh fruits ≥ 3 times/week, the multivariable adjustment odds ratios (ORs) for incident albuminuria associated with fruit consumption 1–2 times/week, 1–3 times/month, and no or rare consumption were 1.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.05–2.40), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17–2.58), and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.20–2.64), respectively. After excluding participants with diabetes, the association remained significant.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Lower fresh fruit consumption was significantly associated with higher risk of incident albuminuria, and fresh fruit consumption frequency could be an essential intervention target to prevent albuminuria in rural China.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</originId><recrawled>1526676128418</recrawled><author><name>Jagannath Mondal</name></author><updated>1526677200000</updated><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/v22HP1dNVjw/article</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>43541b1d</fingerprint><published>1526677200000</published><title>Atomic resolution mechanism of ligand binding to a solvent inaccessible cavity in T4 lysozyme</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:1321:910a81bb</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

&lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; head blight (FHB) mainly caused by &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt;, always brings serious damage to wheat production worldwide. In this study, we found that strain LM2303 had strong antagonist activity against &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; and significantly reduced disease severity of FHB with the control efficiency of 72.3% under field conditions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;velezensis&lt;/i&gt; clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control.

Results suggest that multiple independent evolutionary occurrences of increased behavioral complexity in mammals may at least partly be explained by selection on a common neural system, the cerebellum, which may have been subject to multiple independent neurodevelopmental remodeling events during mammalian evolution.</content></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abee1173:1ed5eca:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05259-x</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05259-x</originId><author><name>Carrie Arnold</name></author><crawled>1527675868013</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05259-x</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>390c286</fingerprint><published>1527663600000</published><title>Money for nothing: the truth about universal basic income</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>256</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money for nothing: the truth about universal basic income&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money for nothing: the truth about universal basic income, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05259-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05259-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Several projects are testing the idea of doling out funds that people can use however they want.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05259-x/d41586-018-05259-x_15792232.jpg</url></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b093d36d:26614c4:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Money for nothing: the truth about universal basic income&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money for nothing: the truth about universal basic income, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05259-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05259-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Several projects are testing the idea of doling out funds that people can use however they want.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198091</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198091</originId><author><name>Edgar Kigozi</name></author><updated>1527714000000</updated><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198091</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>2897af0d</fingerprint><published>1527714000000</published><title>Prevalence and patterns of rifampicin and isoniazid resistance conferring mutations in &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; isolates from Uganda</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198091</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edgar Kigozi, George W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially by using rapid molecular assays, can reduce transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis in communities. However, the frequency of resistance conferring mutations varies with geographic location of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, and this affects the efficiency of rapid molecular assays in detecting resistance. This has created need for characterizing drug resistant isolates from different settings to investigate frequencies of resistance conferring mutations. Here, we describe the prevalence and patterns of rifampicin- and isoniazid- resistance conferring mutations in isolates from Uganda, which could be useful in the management of MDR-TB patients in Uganda and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ninety seven &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates were characterized, of which 38 were MDR, seven rifampicin-resistant, 12 isoniazid-mono-resistant, and 40 susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid. Sequence analysis of the &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt; rifampicin-resistance determining region (&lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR) revealed mutations in six codons: 588, 531, 526, 516, 513, and 511, of which Ser531Leu was the most frequent (40%, 18/45). Overall, the three mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) frequently associated with rifampicin-resistance occurred in 76% of the rifampicin resistant isolates while 18% (8/45) of the rifampicin-resistant isolates lacked mutations in &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter revealed mainly the Ser315Thr (76%, 38/50) and C(-15)T (8%, 4/50) mutations, respectively. These two mutations combined, which are frequently associated with isoniazid-resistance, occurred in 88% of the isoniazid resistant isolates. However, 20% (10/50) of the isoniazid-resistant isolates lacked mutations both in &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter. The sensitivity of sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR for rifampicin-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) was 81%, while it was 77% for analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter to detect isoniazid-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser315Thr, C(-15)T, T(-8)C). Furthermore, considering the circulating TB genotypes in Uganda, the isoniazid-resistance conferring mutations were more frequent in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lineage 4/sub-lineage Uganda, perhaps explaining why this genotype is weakly associated with MDR-TB.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR, &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter is useful in detecting rifampicin/isoniazid resistant &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates in Uganda however, about ≤20% of the resistant isolates lack known resistance-conferring mutations hence rapid molecular assays may not detect them as resistant.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb91f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Edgar Kigozi, George W.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to reveal the factors associated with virologic failure in sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV)-treated patients, and identify baseline NS5A or NS5B resistance-associated substitutions (RASs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Four hundred ninety-three patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection were treated with SOF/LDV; 31 had a history of interferon (IFN)-free treatment with daclatasvir and asunaprevir. The effect of baseline RASs on the response to SOF/LDV therapy was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) was achieved in 476 patients (96.6%). The SVR12 rates in the patients with IFN-free treatment-naïve and retreatment were 97.6% and 80.6%, respectively. HCV elimination was not achieved in 17 patients, 11 (including 5 with IFN-free retreatment) of whom had virologic failure. Eight patients had coexisting NS5A RASs of Q24, L28 and/or R30, L31, or Y93 and one patient had coexisting NS5A RASs of P32L and A92K. Interestingly, 10 and 8 patients had NS5B A218S and C316N RAS respectively. According to a multivariate analysis, coexisting NS5A RASs, NS5A P32 RAS, NS5B A218 and/or C316 RASs, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase were associated with virologic failure. In the naïve patients, all patients without NS5B A218 and/or C316 RAS achieved an SVR12. Notably, the SVR12 rates of patients with coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were significantly lower (83.3%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although SOF/LDV therapy resulted in a high SVR12 rate, coexisting NS5A and NS5B RASs were associated with virologic failure.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ee:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

These RNA-binding proteins account for only ~10% of all known RNA-binding proteins annotated in Gene Ontology, indicating that most are still unexplored using high-throughput sequencing. This negative information provides a great pool of candidate RNA-binding proteins for biologists to conduct future experimental studies. In addition, we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RNA-binding proteins in RBPMetaDB, suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of exercise training with modest or greater weight loss (≥3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) on insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein concentrations, and lipoprotein particle size in overweight and obese participants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Adults (N = 163, body mass index: 25–37 [kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]) participated in 8 months of exercise training. Insulin sensitivity, lipid concentrations, lipid particle size and other cardiometabolic variables were measured at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized by whether they achieved at least modest weight loss (≥ 3%) or not (&amp;lt;3%) following the intervention.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A greater improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in adults performing exercise training with at least modest weight loss (2.2 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 1.5 to 2.8) compared to those who did not (0.8 mU·l&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; ·min &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, CI: 0.5 to 1.2). Similar results were observed for acute insulin response, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol concentration, low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size and high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle size (p&amp;lt;0.05), when all exercise groups were combined. No significant results across weight loss categories were observed for LDL, HDL, glucose, or insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study suggests that aerobic exercise combined with at least modest weight loss leads to greater improvements in insulin sensitivity, triglycerides as well as other non-traditional lipid risk factors (non-HDL cholesterol, HDL/LDL particle size).

This paper presents a robust 3D point cloud registration algorithm based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). Comparing with traditional registration algorithm based on the mean square error (MSE), using the MCC is superior in dealing with complex registration problem with non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Since the MCC is considered as a probability measure which weights the corresponding points for registration, the noisy points are penalized. Moreover, we propose to use bidirectional measures which can maximum the overlapping parts and avoid the registration result being trapped into a local minimum. Both of these strategies can better apply the information theory method to the point cloud registration problem, making the algorithm more robust. In the process of implementation, we integrate the fixed-point optimization technique based on the iterative closest point algorithm, resulting in the correspondence and transformation parameters that are solved iteratively. The comparison experiments under noisy conditions with related algorithms have demonstrated good performance of the proposed algorithm.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6e:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xuetao Zhang, Libo Jian, Meifeng Xu&lt;/p&gt;

We report that brief exposure to TCS, at relatively low doses, causes low-grade colonic inflammation, increases colitis, and exacerbates colitis-associated colon cancer in mice. Exposure to TCS alters gut microbiota in mice, and its proinflammatory effect is attenuated in germ-free mice.

We report that brief exposure to TCS, at relatively low doses, causes low-grade colonic inflammation, increases colitis, and exacerbates colitis-associated colon cancer in mice. Exposure to TCS alters gut microbiota in mice, and its proinflammatory effect is attenuated in germ-free mice. In addition, TCS treatment increases activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in vivo and fails to promote colitis in &lt;i&gt;Tlr4&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice.

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy. Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635157c215:1f2da93:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</content></content></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/444/eaau0465?rss=1</link><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/444/eaau0465?rss=1</originId><author><name>Au, S.

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna C.

This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain–computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI–user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface—application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging—with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSdFB8wknvs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1634b2bb83a:4d2b0:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Serafeim Perdikis, Luca Tonin, Sareh Saeedi, Christoph Schneider, José del R.

As compared with type I ligands, binding of a type II compound often achieves longer residence time. We developed a novel virtual drug screening package which takes advantage of two energy evaluation methods: Superposition and Single-Point Energy Evaluation, and VM2 free energy calculation, and applied it to the discovery of new CDK8 type II ligands. In this research we analyzed binding thermodynamics of 11 published CDK8 type II ligands, and extracted the key binding information to assist virtual drug screening for new ligands. The free energy and MD calculations on the reference CDK8-ligand complexes revealed the important factors in the binding. The urea moiety was found to be the critical structural contributor of the reference ligands. Starting with the urea moiety we implemented virtual drug screening and singled out three compounds for bio-assay testing. The ranking from the experimental result for the three compounds is completely consistent with the predicted rankings by both energy evaluation methods. A potent drug-like compound was discovered to have a Kd value of 42.5 nM with CDK8, which is comparable to the most potent reference ligands and provided a good starting point to design and synthesize a series of highly selective and potent CDK8 ligands. Therefore, our novel virtual drug screening package is accurate and efficient enough to be used in drug design projects. We believe this work has significant impact to the field of drug discovery.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635f1b0a82:2fccb78:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Selective inhibition of CDK8 could be a promising strategy for reducing mitogenic signals in cancer cells with reduced toxic effects on normal cells.

As global political preeminence gradually shifted from the United Kingdom to the United States, so did the capacity to culturally influence the rest of the world. In this work, we analyze how the world-wide varieties of written English are evolving. We study both the spatial and temporal variations of vocabulary and spelling of English using a large corpus of geolocated tweets and the Google Books datasets corresponding to books published in the US and the UK. The advantage of our approach is that we can address both standard written language (Google Books) and the more colloquial forms of microblogging messages (Twitter). We find that American English is the dominant form of English outside the UK and that its influence is felt even within the UK borders. Finally, we analyze how this trend has evolved over time and the impact that some cultural events have had in shaping it.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd72:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Gonçalves, Lucía Loureiro-Porto, José J.

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that is well known for its ability to enhance human health, and products made from this fungus have been highly profitable. The substrate-degrading ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; could be related to its growth. CAZy proteins were more abundant in its genome than in the other white rot fungi models. Among these CAZy proteins, changes in lignocellulolytic enzymes during growth have not been well studied. Using genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic analyses, this study focuses on the lignocellulolytic enzymes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119 to determine which of these degradative enzymes contribute to its growth. From the genome sequencing data, genes belonging to CAZy protein families, especially genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, were investigated. The gene expression, protein abundance and enzymatic activity of lignocellulolytic enzymes in mycelia over a growth cycle were analysed. The overall expression cellulase was higher than that of hemicellulase and lignin-modifying enzymes, particularly during the development of fruiting bodies. The cellulase and hemicellulase abundances and activities increased after the fruiting bodies matured, when basidiospores were produced in massive quantities till the end of the growth cycle. Additionally, the protein abundances of the lignin-modifying enzymes and the expression of their corresponding genes, including laccases and lignin-degrading heme peroxidases, were highest when the mycelia fully spread in the compost bag. Type I cellobiohydrolase was observed to be the most abundant extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme produced by the &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119. The AA2 family haem peroxidases were the dominant lignin-modifying enzyme expressed during the mycelial growth phase, and several laccases might play roles during the formation of the primordium. This study provides insight into the changes in the lignocellulose degradation ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; during its growth and will facilitate the discovery of new approaches to accelerate the growth of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; in culture.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b954:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shuai Zhou, Jingsong Zhang, Fuying Ma, Chuanhong Tang, Qingjiu Tang, Xiaoyu Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7d:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Maria Turcato, Marco Godi, Marica Giardini, Ilaria Arcolin, Antonio Nardone, Andrea Giordano, Marco Schieppati&lt;/p&gt;

We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</originId><author><name>Viktorija Ilieva</name></author><updated>1525813200000</updated><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>47e98465</fingerprint><published>1525813200000</published><title>“Yes, we know!” (Over)confidence in general knowledge among Austrian entrepreneurs</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;
Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329334v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329334v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Singh, R.</name></author><crawled>1527279463664</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329334v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>27a81668</fingerprint><published>1527231600000</published><title>Attend and Predict: Understanding Gene Regulation by Selective Attention on Chromatin [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/329334</canonicalUrl><engagement>3</engagement><description>The past decade has seen a revolution in genomic technologies that enable a flood of genome-wide profiling of chromatin marks.

Target selection is the first and pivotal step in drug discovery. An incorrect choice may not manifest itself for many years after hundreds of millions of research dollars have been spent. We collected a set of 332 targets that succeeded or failed in phase III clinical trials, and explored whether Omic features describing the target genes could predict clinical success. We obtained features from the recently published comprehensive resource: Harmonizome. Nineteen features appeared to be significantly correlated with phase III clinical trial outcomes, but only 4 passed validation schemes that used bootstrapping or modified permutation tests to assess feature robustness and generalizability while accounting for target class selection bias. We also used classifiers to perform multivariate feature selection and found that classifiers with a single feature performed as well in cross-validation as classifiers with more features (AUROC = 0.57 and AUPR = 0.81). The two predominantly selected features were mean mRNA expression across tissues and standard deviation of expression across tissues, where successful targets tended to have lower mean expression and higher expression variance than failed targets. This finding supports the conventional wisdom that it is favorable for a target to be present in the tissue(s) affected by a disease and absent from other tissues. Overall, our results suggest that it is feasible to construct a model integrating interpretable target features to inform target selection. We anticipate deeper insights and better models in the future, as researchers can reuse the data we have provided to improve methods for handling sample biases and learn more informative features.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00204</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00204</originId><author><name>Narendra Nath Dutta, Konrad Patkowski</name></author><crawled>1527712728563</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00204/20180530/images/medium/ct-2018-002044_0014.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00204&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an inflammatory and neuropathic pain disorder characterized by the involvement of the autonomic nervous system with sensory, autonomic, motor, skin, and bone changes. At present, universally accepted consensus criteria for CRPS are not yet established, despite the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Various hypotheses for the pathophysiology of CRPS have been proposed; as a result, current therapeutic modalities are varied. General epidemiological data on CRPS are necessary for effective management. However, recent data on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and other epidemiological features of CRPS in the general population in Korea. In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b784:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyungtae Kim, Cheol-Hyeong Lee, Sung-Hun Kim, Yeon-Dong Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) are primary bacterial niche and immune response cells during &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb)&lt;/i&gt; infection, and human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are a model for investigating &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;-macrophage interactions. Here, we use a targeted RNA-Seq method to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA expression patterns of freshly obtained HAM (used within 6 h) and 6 day cultured MDM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection over time (2, 24 and 72 h), in both uninfected and infected cells from three donors each. The Ion AmpliSeq™ Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (AmpliSeq) uses primers targeting 18,574 mRNAs and 2,228 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for a total of 20,802 transcripts. AmpliSeq&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; yields highly precise and reproducible gene expression profiles (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;0.99). Taking advantage of AmpliSeq’s reproducibility, we establish well-defined quantitative RNA expression patterns of HAM &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; MDM, including significant &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb-&lt;/i&gt;inducible genes, in networks and pathways that differ in part between MDM and HAM. A similar number of expressed genes are detected at all time-points between uninfected MDM and HAM, in common pathways including inflammatory and immune functions, but canonical pathway differences also exist. In particular, at 2 h, multiple genes relevant to the immune response are preferentially expressed in either uninfected HAM or MDM, while the HAM RNA profiles approximate MDM profiles over time in culture, highlighting the unique RNA expression profile of freshly obtained HAM. MDM demonstrate a greater transcriptional response than HAM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection, with 2 to &gt;10 times more genes up- or down-regulated. The results identify key genes involved in cellular responses to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; in two different human macrophage types. Follow-up bioinformatics analysis indicates that approximately 30% of response genes have expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs in GTEx), common DNA variants that can influence host gene expression susceptibility or resistance to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, illustrated with the &lt;i&gt;TREM1&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb925:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Audrey C.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;California’s Workers’ Compensation System (CAWCS) Department of Industrial Relations questioned the adequacy of the current Medi-Cal fee-schedule pricing and requested analysis of alternatives that maximize price availability and maintain budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To compare CAWCS pharmacy-dispensed (PD) drug prices under alternative fee schedules, and identify combinations of alternative benchmarks that have prices available for the largest percentage of PD drugs and that best reach budget neutrality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Claims transaction-level data (2011–2013) from CAWCS were used to estimate total annual PD pharmaceutical payments. Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price. Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd69:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Leslie Wilson, Fatema A.

Fee-schedules may not offer the best price and a formulary approach may provide more flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</originId><author><name>Mi Ri Park</name></author><crawled>1525944150659</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dJ4_7Qwrtr4/s41598-018-25333-8</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>fcda161b</fingerprint><published>1525935600000</published><title>Probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans through a nuclear hormone receptor</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25333-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dJ4_7Qwrtr4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163495bea83:125a9f4:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25333-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25333-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Probiotic &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strain JDFM216 stimulates the longevity and immune response of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; through a nuclear hormone receptor&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dJ4_7Qwrtr4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</originId><author><name>Yuki Yagasaki</name></author><updated>1527714000000</updated><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>1d70d078</fingerprint><published>1527714000000</published><title>Experience-dependent MeCP2 expression in the excitatory cells of mouse visual thalamus</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;
Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb928:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Paddy rice fields are one of the most important sources of anthropogenic methane. Improving the accuracy in the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; budget is fundamental to identify strategies to mitigate climate change. Such improvement requires a mechanistic understanding of the complex interactions between environmental and agronomic factors determining CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and also the characterization of the annual temporal CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions pattern in the whole crop cycle. Hence, both the growing and fallow seasons must be included. However, most of the previous research has been based on single-factor analyses that are focused on the growing season. In order to fill this gap, a study was conducted in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem (Ebre Delta, Catalonia) following a farm-to-farm approach with the purpose of 1) evaluating the cumulative and temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission, and 2) conducting a multi-variate analyses to assess the associative pattern, relative contribution and temporal variation of the main explanatory variables concerning the observed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Measurements of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and agronomic and environmental parameters in 15 commercial rice fields were monitored monthly, during a whole crop field cycle. The temporal pattern of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission followed a bi-modal distribution peaking in August and October. The cumulative annual CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from rice fields amounted 314 kg CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, of which &lt;i&gt;ca&lt;/i&gt;. 70% were emitted during the fallow season. The main controlling factors of the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emission rate in the growing season were positive related to water level and plant cover, while soil redox was negatively related. The main controlling factors in the fallow season were water level (negatively related, conversely to the growing season), as well as straw incorporation and soil temperature (positively related). The results of this study highlight the importance of the often neglected fallow season in the accurate estimation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and, thus, the necessity of measurement programs that cover the whole crop field cycle.

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

Moreover, the reaction is clean as water is generated as the only byproduct.</content></summary><unread>True</unread><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1636415ab0f:3973795:2835af05</id></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</originId><author><name>Efthymia Giosa</name></author><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>d7dac92a</fingerprint><published>1525986000000</published><title>The importance of artificial wetlands for birds: A case study from Cyprus</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;
The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e9:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) and control (0.30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). The final average VWC was 0.11, 0.22, and 0.31 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and significant differences in biomass accumulation were observed between control and drought treatments. Second, 42 diverse sorghum genotypes were subjected to a seven-day dry-down treatment for a final drought stress of 0.15 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; VWC. The final average VWC was 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and plants presented significant differences in photosynthetic rate during the drought period. These results demonstrate that cost-effective automation systems can successfully control substrate water content for each plant, to accurately compare their phenotypic responses to drought, and be scaled up for high-throughput phenotyping studies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd1:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Ortiz, Alexander G.

A critical issue in transgene delivery studies is immune reactivity to the transgene- encoded protein and its impact on sustained gene expression. Here, we test the hypothesis that immunomodulation by rapamycin can decrease immune reactivity after intrathecal AAV9 delivery of a transgene (GFP) in non-human primates, resulting in sustained GFP expression in the CNS. We show that rapamycin treatment clearly reduced the overall immunogenicity of the AAV9/GFP vector by lowering GFP- and AAV9-specific antibody responses, and decreasing T cell responses including cytokine and cytolytic effector responses. Spinal cord GFP protein expression was sustained for twelve weeks, with no toxicity. Immune correlates of robust transgene expression include negligible GFP-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, absence of GFP-specific IFN-γ producing T cells, and absence of GFP-specific cytotoxic T cells, which support the hypothesis that decreased T cell reactivity results in sustained transgene expression. These data strongly support the use of modest doses of rapamycin to modulate immune responses for intrathecal gene therapies, and potentially a much wider range of viral vector-based therapeutics.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arlene I.

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women.

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

Based on this study, we also developed a web bench, CancerUBM, for mining proteomics data, which is freely available at http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/cancerubm/.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</originId><author><name>Hu Zhang</name></author><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/brCdFezzLBI/s41598-018-25542-1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>99aa693f</fingerprint><published>1525762800000</published><title>OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in C. elegans male ray neurons</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25542-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/brCdFezzLBI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><width>656</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25542-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25542_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cbe:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25542-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/brCdFezzLBI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327890v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327890v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Zhang, Q.</name></author><crawled>1527094649904</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327890v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>be9e3fbb</fingerprint><published>1527058800000</published><title>Improved prediction of chronological age from DNA methylation limits it as a biomarker of ageing [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/327890</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><description>DNA methylation is associated with age.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several studies have shown that long-term survival after acute kidney injury (AKI) is reduced even if there is clinical recovery. However, we recently reported that in septic shock patients those that recover from AKI have survival similar to patients without AKI. Here, we studied a cohort with less severe sepsis to examine the effects of AKI on longer-term survival as a function of recovery by discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed patients with community-acquired pneumonia from the Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) cohort. We included patients who developed AKI (KDIGO stages 2–3) and defined renal recovery as alive at hospital discharge with return of SCr to within 150% of baseline without dialysis. Our primary outcome was survival up to 3 years analyzed using Gray’s model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1742 patients who survived to hospital discharge, stage 2–3 AKI occurred in 262 (15%), of which 111 (42.4%) recovered. Compared to recovered patients, patients without recovery were older (75 ±14 vs 69 ±15 years, p&amp;lt;0.001) and were more likely to have at least stage 1 AKI on day 1 (83% vs 52%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Overall, 445 patients (25.5%) died during follow-up, 23.4% (347/1480) for no AKI, 28% (31/111) for AKI with recovery and 44.3% (67/151) for AKI without recovery. Patients who did not recover had worse survival compared to no AKI (HR range 1.05–2.46, p = 0.01), while recovering patients had similar survival compared to no AKI (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.69–1.47, p = 0.96). Absence of AKI on day 1, no in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT), higher Apache III score and higher baseline SCr were associated with recovery after AKI.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In patients with sepsis, recovery by hospital discharge is associated with long-term survival similar to patients without AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc8:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Fiorentino, Fadi A.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy. In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1634a035710:134134b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life.

It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5774.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5774.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Marc D.

The polymorphisms at the α-chain of the IL-7 receptor (&lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt;) have been related to T-cell homeostasis and development and may contribute to immune system deregulation. In the present study, we analyzed the association between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms and the progression of liver fibrosis in patients infected with HCV. We carried out a retrospective study with a design consisting of repeated measurements in 187 HCV-infected patients, to study the risk prediction of liver fibrosis progression using genetic factors. We genotyped the rs6897932, rs987106 and rs3194051 &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms using the Agena Bioscience’s MassARRAY. Transient elastography was used to measure liver stiffness. The used cut-offs were: &amp;lt;7.1 kPa (F0-F1), 7.1–9.4 kPa (F2; significant fibrosis), 9.5-12.4 kPa (F3; advanced fibrosis), and ≥12.5 kPa (F4; cirrhosis). All HCV genotypes were analyzed. The median of follow-up time was 47.9 months. Baseline liver stiffness measurement (LSM) values did not show significant statistical differences for &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes (p&gt;0.05). In univariate analysis, the rs6897932 T allele had a positive relationship with an increase in LSM (arithmetic mean ratio (AMR) = 1.21 (95%CI = 1.08; 1.36); p = 0.001), progression to advanced fibrosis (F≥3) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 (95%CI = 1.29; 4.88); p = 0.006) and progression to cirrhosis (F4) (OR = 2.71 (95%CI = 0.94; 5.03); p = 0.069). In multivariable analysis, the rs6897932 T allele was related to a higher increase of LSM values during follow-up (adjusted AMR = 1.27 (95%CI = 1.13; 1.42); p&amp;lt;0.001) and higher odds of progression to advanced fibrosis [adjusted OR = 4.46 (95%CI = 1.87; 10.62); p = 0.001], and progression to cirrhosis [adjusted OR = 3.92 (95%CI = 1.30; 11.77); p = 0.015]. Regarding &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and rs3194051 polymorphisms, we did not find significant results except for the relationship between &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs987106 and the increase in LSM values [adjusted OR = 1.12 (95%CI = 1.02; 1.23); p = 0.015]. The &lt;i&gt;IL7RA&lt;/i&gt; rs6897932 polymorphism seems to be related to increased risk of liver fibrosis progression in HCV-infected patients. Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee2:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Ángeles Jiménez-Sousa, Ana Zaida Gómez-Moreno, Daniel Pineda-Tenor, Luz Maria Medrano, Juan José Sánchez-Ruano, Amanda Fernández-Rodríguez, Tomas Artaza-Varasa, José Saura-Montalbán, Sonia Vázquez-Morón, Pablo Ryan, Salvador Resino&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the rs6897932 polymorphism could be related to the physiopathology of CHC and might be used to successfully stratify the risk of CHC progression.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198488</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198488</originId><author><name>Monica Oliveira Bernardo</name></author><updated>1527800400000</updated><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198488</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>f4010df3</fingerprint><published>1527800400000</published><title>Physicians&apos; self-assessed empathy levels do not correlate with patients&apos; assessments</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198488</canonicalUrl><engagement>33</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Monica Oliveira Bernardo, Dario Cecílio-Fernandes, Patrício Costa, Thelma A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Empathy is a fundamental humanistic component of patient care which facilitates efficient and patient-centered clinical encounters. Despite being the principal recipient of physician empathy little work on how patients perceive/report receiving empathy from their physicians has been undertaken. In the context of doctor-patient interactions, knowledge about empathy has mostly originated from physicians’ perspectives and has been developed from studies using self-assessment instruments. In general, self-assessment may not correlate well with the reality observed by others.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To investigate: 1—the relationship between physicians’ self-assessed empathy and patients’ measures of physicians’ empathy; 2 –Environmental factors that could influence patients’ perceptions; and 3 –the correlation between two widely used psychometric scales to measure empathy from the perspective of patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an observational study which enrolled 945 patients and 51 physicians from radiology, clinical, and surgical specialties. The physicians completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE) and the International Reactivity Index (IRI), and patients completed the Consultation and Relational Empathy scale (CARE), and the Jefferson Scale of Patient’s Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We did not observe any significant correlation between total self-assessed empathy and patients’ perceptions. We observed a small correlation (r = 0,3, P&amp;lt;0,05) between the sub-dimension Perspective Taking-JSE and JSPPPE. JSPPPE and CARE had a positive and moderate correlation (0,56; p&amp;lt;0,001). Physicians’ gender and sector influenced the JSPPPE score. Sector, medical specialty and the nature of the appointment (initial versus subsequent) influenced the CARE measure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The lack of correlation between self-assessed empathy levels and patients’ perceptions suggests patients be included in the process of empathy evaluation.&lt;/p&gt; Practice implications &lt;p&gt;Training strategies aiming the development of empathy should include patients’ evaluations and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b956:7cfe07d6</id><engagementRate>33.0</engagementRate><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monica Oliveira Bernardo, Dario Cecílio-Fernandes, Patrício Costa, Thelma A.

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2342:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197865</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197865</originId><author><name>Keiko Katagiri</name></author><updated>1526590800000</updated><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197865</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>f4cd6a1d</fingerprint><published>1526590800000</published><title>Correction: Factors determining the social participation of older adults: A comparison between Japan and Korea using EASS 2012</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197865</canonicalUrl><description>&lt;p&gt;by Keiko Katagiri, Ju-Hyun Kim&lt;/p&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544f:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Keiko Katagiri, Ju-Hyun Kim&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5664.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/5664.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Zhixuan Zhou, Jiangping Liu, Thomas W.

Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6022.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6022.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Tiantian Yu, Weichao Wu, Wenyue Liang, Mark Alexander Lever, Kai-Uwe Hinrichs, Fengping Wang</name></author><crawled>1528220492204</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6022.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>c182a3b1</fingerprint><published>1528216865000</published><title>Growth of sedimentary Bathyarchaeota on lignin as an energy source [Environmental Sciences]</title><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6022</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Members of the archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota are among the most abundant microorganisms on Earth.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common urologic malignancies and it is urgently needed to identify novel potential prognostic biomarkers for predicting prognosis and progression of patients with BC in clinical practice. Previous research has revealed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) played critical roles in BC, and may serve as novel potential prognostic biomarkers in patients with BC. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to clarify the prognostic potential of lncRNAs in BC patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). According to the predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria, a total of 9 recently published articles comprising 13 lncRNAs and 666 BC patients were included into this meta-analysis. We analyzed the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the relationship between lncRNAs expression and survival outcomes. We also analyzed the odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the association between lncRNAs expression and clinicopathological characteristics, including histological grade, gender, multifocality, tumor size, and tumor stage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our results revealed that high lncRNAs expression was associated with shorter overall survival in Asian BC patients (pooled HR = 2.32, 95% CI: 1.35–4.00, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, random-effect). High lncRNAs expression levels were significantly associated with histological grade (G2-G3 vs. G1: OR = 3.857, 95%CI: 1.293–11.502, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015, random-effect).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In summary, this meta-analysis has demonstrated that lncRNAs could be used as potential prognostic markers for BC and high lncRNAs expression could predict poor prognosis among Asian BC patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd3:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuexin Xia, Zhiyuan Liu, Weijian Yu, Shihang Zhou, Linnan Shao, Wenqian Song, Ming Liu&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676123b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</content></content></item><item><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34248</link><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34248</originId><author><name>lotem.elber@mail.huji.ac.il (Lotem Elber-Dorozko)</name></author><crawled>1527767771027</crawled><description>It is generally believed that during economic decisions, striatal neurons represent the values associated with different actions.

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7a:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Xenon is frequently used as a general anesthetic in humans, but the mechanism remains an issue of debate. While for some membrane proteins, a direct interaction of xenon with the protein has been shown to be the inhibitory mechanism, other membrane protein functions could be affected by changes of membrane properties due to partitioning of the gas into the lipid bilayer. Here, the effect of xenon on a mechanosensitive ion channel and a copper ion-translocating ATPase was compared under different conditions. Xenon inhibited spontaneous gating of the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; mechano-sensitive mutant channel MscL-G22E, as shown by patch-clamp recording techniques. Under high hydrostatic pressure, MscL-inhibition was reversed. Similarly, the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus hirae&lt;/i&gt; CopB copper ATPase, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, was inhibited by xenon. However, the CopB ATPase activity was also inhibited by xenon when CopB was in a solubilized state. These findings suggest that xenon acts by directly interacting with these proteins, rather than &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; indirect effects by altering membrane properties. Also, inhibition of copper transport may be a novel effect of xenon that contributes to anesthesia.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b782:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Evgeny Petrov, Gopalakrishnan Menon, Paul R.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00116</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00116</originId><author><name>Sigurd Vogler, Gökcen Savasci, Martin Ludwig, Christian Ochsenfeld</name></author><crawled>1526400997639</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00116/20180515/images/medium/ct-2018-00116d_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00116&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Endothelial cells play an essential role in regulating an immune response through promoting leukocyte adhesion and cell migration and production of cytokines such as TNFα. Regulation of endothelial cell immune function is tightly regulated and recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are prominently involved in this process. However, the importance of EVs in regulating endothelial activation in the context of a bacterial infection is poorly understood. To begin addressing this knowledge gap we characterized the endothelial cell response to EVs released from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infected macrophages. Our result showed increased macrophage migration through the monolayer when endothelial cells were pretreated with EVs isolated from &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and the inflammatory process in endothelial cells treated with EVs. These results were validated by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several immune response-related pathways were up-regulated. Endothelial cells were also treated with EVs isolated from the serum of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, EVs isolated 14 days but not 7 or 21 days post-infection showed a similar ability to induce endothelial cell activation suggesting a change in EV function during the course of an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy result indicated that NF-κB and the Type 1 interferon pathways were involved in endothelial activation by EVs. In summary, our data suggest that EVs can activate endothelial cells and thus may play an important role in modulating host immune responses during an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b950:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Li, Yong Cheng, Scott Emrich, Jeffrey Schorey&lt;/p&gt;

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of cognitive deficits suggests that too low or too high extracellular DA concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can severely impair the working memory (WM) maintenance during delay period. Thus, there exists only an optimal range of DA where the sustained-firing activity, the neural correlate of WM maintenance, in the cortex possesses optimal firing frequency as well as robustness against noisy distractions. Empirical evidences demonstrate changes even in the D1 receptor (D1R)-sensitivity to extracellular DA, collectively manifested through D1R density and DA-binding affinity, in the PFC under neuropsychiatric conditions such as ageing and schizophrenia. However, the impact of alterations in the cortical D1R-sensitivity on WM maintenance has yet remained poorly addressed. Using a quantitative neural mass model of the prefronto-mesoprefrontal system, the present study reveals that higher D1R-sensitivity may not only effectuate shrunk optimal DA range but also shift of the range to lower concentrations. Moreover, higher sensitivity may significantly reduce the WM-robustness even within the optimal DA range and exacerbates the decline at abnormal DA levels. These findings project important clinical implications, such as dosage precision and variability of DA-correcting drugs across patients, and failure in acquiring healthy WM maintenance even under drug-controlled normal cortical DA levels.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c23:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa Reneaux, Rahul Gupta&lt;/p&gt;

E.Vöhringer‐Martinez</name></author><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><description>Partition coefficients serve in various areas as pharmacology and environmental sciences to predict the hydrophobicity of different substances. Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations. Chloroform–water partition coefficients derived from the obtained free energies were compared to experimental and previously reported values obtained with the GAFF or the AMBER‐99 force field. The results show that good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the polarization of the electron density by the solvent has been taken into account, and when the energy needed to polarize the electron density of the solute has been considered in the transfer free energy.

Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations. Chloroform–water partition coefficients derived from the obtained free energies were compared to experimental and previously reported values obtained with the GAFF or the AMBER‐99 force field. The results show that good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the polarization of the electron density by the solvent has been taken into account, and when the energy needed to polarize the electron density of the solute has been considered in the transfer free energy. These results were further confirmed by hydration free energies of polar and aromatic amino acid side chain analogs. Comparison of the two partitioning methods, Hirshfeld‐I and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), revealed some deficiencies in the Hirshfeld‐I method related to the unstable isolated anionic nitrogen pro‐atom used in the method. Hydration free energies and partitioning coefficients obtained with atomic charges from the MBIS partitioning method accounting for polarization by the implicit solvation model are in good agreement with the experimental values. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569c3:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4827.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4827.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Behrooz Ferdowsi, Carlos P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has been related to intrauterine brain development and neurodevelopmental disabilities in adult life. We aim to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and prenatal cerebellar growth from the first trimester onwards.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;126 women with singleton non-malformed pregnancies were enrolled before 8 weeks of gestation in the Rotterdam periconceptional cohort between 2013 and 2015. Periconceptional maternal dietary patterns were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and associated with blood biomarkers and micronutrient intakes. Serial two-dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound scans were performed at 9, 11, 22, 26 and 32 weeks of gestation for transcerebellar diameter (TCD) measurement. Linear mixed models were estimated to investigate associations between periconceptional maternal dietary patterns and longitudinal TCD measurements as a function of gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We performed a median of 4 scans per pregnancy, resulting in 570 total datasets. The success rate of TCD measurements was 87% (range 65–100%), depending on gestational age. The Mediterranean, Western, egg-rich and dairy-rich dietary patterns were extracted, explaining 37.2% of the overall variance of food intake in this population. The dairy-rich dietary pattern was positively associated with cerebellar growth trajectories (β = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01; 0.03) √mm, p = 0.01). Maternal strong adherence to this dietary pattern increased TCD measurements by 0.8 standard deviation scores (SDs) compared to weak adherence, reflected in increased TCD estimates of 0.44 mm at 9 weeks (+6.8%), 0.88 mm at 22 weeks (+3.6%), and 1.17 mm at 32 weeks (+2.8%). No significant associations were detected for the Mediterranean, Western and egg-rich dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study shows a positive association between periconceptional maternal adherence to a dairy-rich dietary pattern and human prenatal TCD measurements as a proxy of cerebellar growth.

Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094065:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Yu Wang, Bing Ge, Ju Shi, Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Chang-Hua Tang, Dong-Cheng Zhu, Hong Zhu, Xing-Bo Mo, Yong-Hong Zhang, Fei-Yan Deng, Shu-Feng Lei&lt;/p&gt;

We find that stochastic fluctuations of the proteome and not those of the transcriptome can discriminate between various circuit topologies.</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</originId><author><name>Lun, X.-K.</name></author><crawled>1525799861287</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>88ed25ec</fingerprint><published>1525762800000</published><title>Analysis of the human kinome and phosphatome reveals diseased signaling networks induced by overexpression [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/08/314716</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance in many cancer types.

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs.

Muscle wasting occurs during various chronic diseases and precedes death in humans as in mice. The evaluation of the degree of muscle atrophy in diseased mouse models is often overlooked since it requires the sacrifice of the animals for muscle examination or expensive instrumentation and highly qualified personnel, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Very often behavioral tests for muscle strength evaluation are used as an outcome measurement in preclinical therapeutic trials. However, these tests are easy to perform serially, but not enough sensitive to detect early muscle changes during disease progression. Monitoring muscle loss in living animals could allow to perform more informative preclinical trials with a better evaluation of therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle wasting. We developed a non-invasive procedure based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) without contrast agents to monitor hind limb muscle wasting in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer cachexia: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and the colon adenocarcinoma C26-bearing mouse, respectively. We established the scanning procedure and the parameters to consider in the reconstructed images to calculate the Index of Muscle Mass (IMM). The coefficient of variance for the whole procedure was 2.2%. We performed longitudinally micro-CT scan of hind limbs in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease and calculated the IMM. We found that IMM in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice was lower than age-matched controls even before symptom onset. We also detected a further decrease in IMM as disease progresses, most markedly just before disease onset. We performed the same analyses in the C26-based mouse model losing quickly body and muscle mass because of cancer cachexia. Overall, we found that the reduced muscle content detected by micro-CT mirrored the reduced muscle weight in both disease models. We developed a fast, precise and easy-to-conduct imaging procedure to monitor hind limb muscle mass, useful in therapeutic preclinical trials but also in proof-of-principle studies to identify the onset of muscle wasting. This method could be widely applied to other disease models characterized by muscle wasting, to assist drug development and search for early biomarkers of muscle atrophy. Moreover, reducing the number of mice needed for the experiments and being less distressing are in line with the 3R principle embodied in national and international directives for animal research.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1d:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Pasetto, Davide Olivari, Giovanni Nardo, Maria Chiara Trolese, Caterina Bendotti, Rosanna Piccirillo, Valentina Bonetto&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914e:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The relative influence of prematurity vs. maternal social factors (socioeconomic status and education level) on academic performance has rarely been examined.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine the impact of prematurity and maternal social factors on academic performance from 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; through 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants born in 1998 at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The study sample included 58 extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, 23‒&amp;lt;28 weeks), 171 preterm (≥28‒&amp;lt;34 weeks), 228 late preterm (≥34‒&amp;lt;37 weeks), and 967 term ((≥37‒&amp;lt;42 weeks) infants. Neonatal and maternal variables were collected including maternal insurance status (proxy measure for socioeconomic status) and education level. The primary outcomes were literacy and mathematics achievement-test scores from 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; through 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; grade. Linear mixed models were used to identify significant predictors of academic performance. All two-way interactions between grade level, gestational-age (GA) groups, and social factors were tested for statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Prematurity, social factors, gender, race, gravidity, and Apgar score at one minute were critical determinants of academic performance. Favorable social factors were associated with a significant increase in both literacy and mathematic scores, while prematurity was associated with a significant decrease in mathematic scores. Examination of GA categories and social factors interaction suggested that the impact of social factors on test scores was similar for all GA groups. Furthermore, the impact of social factors varied from grade to grade for literacy, while the influence of either GA groups or social factors was constant across grades for mathematics. For example, an ELGAN with favorable social factors had a predicted literacy score 104.1 (P &amp;lt;.001), 98.2 (P &amp;lt;.001), and 76.4 (P &amp;lt;.01) points higher than an otherwise similar disadvantaged term infant at grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. The difference in their predicted mathematic scores was 33.4 points for all grades (P &amp;lt;.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While there were significant deficits in academic performance for ELGANs compared to PT, LPT, and term infants, the deficit could be offset by higher SES and better-educated mothers. These favorable social factors were critical to a child’s academic achievement. The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b93c:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nahed O.

The role of socioeconomic factors should be incorporated in discussions on outcome with families of preterm infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</originId><author><name>Reese, A.</name></author><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Anthropology, Science and Policy</item></keywords><fingerprint>8c368bbc</fingerprint><published>1526578752000</published><title>Drilling threatens ancient Chaco landscape</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/693.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>89</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395e0:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25729-6</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25729-6</originId><author><name>Rashindra Manniesing</name></author><crawled>1526337345875</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/fnAMYQcl9rc/s41598-018-25729-6</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25729-6</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>e3e863db</fingerprint><published>1526367600000</published><title>Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25729-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25729-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/fnAMYQcl9rc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16360cb9953:32b4bf8:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25729-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25729-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: White Matter and Gray Matter Segmentation in 4D Computed Tomography&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/fnAMYQcl9rc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03518</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03518</originId><author><name>Satoshi Yamashita, Misao Mizuno, Duy Phuoc Tran, Hisham Dokainish, Akio Kitao, Yasuhisa Mizutani</name></author><crawled>1527185435213</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03518/20180523/images/medium/jp-2018-035189_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03518&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c3:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094068:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;

Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5213.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5213.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Ioannis A.

It has been observed that the number of phonemes in languages in use today tends to decrease with increasing distance from Africa. A previous formal model has recently reproduced the observed cline, but under two strong assumptions. Here we tackle the question of whether an alternative explanation for the worldwide phonemic cline is possible, by using alternative assumptions. The answer is affirmative. We show this by formalizing a proposal, following Atkinson, that this pattern may be due to a repeated bottleneck effect and phonemic loss. In our simulations, low-density populations lose phonemes during the Out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans. Our results reproduce the observed global cline for the number of phonemes. In addition, we also detect a cline of phonemic diversity and reproduce it using our simulation model. We suggest how future work could determine whether the previous model or the new one (or even a combination of them) is valid. Simulations also show that the clines can still be present even 300 kyr after the Out-of-Africa dispersal, which is contrary to some previous claims which were not supported by numerical simulations.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84549:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joaquim Pérez-Losada, Joaquim Fort&lt;/p&gt;

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee1:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael J.

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are important DNA lesions induced by endogenous crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, as well as ionizing radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and abortive action of some enzymes. Due to their very bulky nature, they are expected to interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. DPCs are highly genotoxic and the ability of cells to deal with them is relevant for many chemotherapeutic interventions. However, interactions of DNA polymerases with DPCs have been poorly studied due to the lack of a convenient experimental model. We have used NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced trapping of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase, &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases β, κ and λ, and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4–5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf7:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna V.

We have used NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced trapping of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase, &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases β, κ and λ, and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4–5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</content></content></item><item><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/531/eaao2341?rss=1</link><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/531/eaao2341?rss=1</originId><author><name>Fulcher, L.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jason G.

We spend a lot of time thinking about proteins in terms of their primary sequence and features of their three-dimensional structure (binding pockets, recognition domains, etc.) And that’s understandable. But it’s always important not to lose sight of the fact that the surfaces of proteins are decorated with all kinds of ornaments that are vital for their function, even if they’re synthetically hard to control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief among those are phosphates, you’d have to say. Kinases, of course, phosphorylate things and phosphatases take those back off (and as is often the case in biology, those two classes of enzymes are rather unbalanced: there are a lot more specific kinases out there, compared to a relatively small number of jack-of-all-trades phosphatases). Phosphorylation state can be a powerful on/off switch on specific protein residues, but it’s worth remembering that proteins can have a whole long list of phosphoryation sites once you get past the heavy-duty ones. The number of kinase inhibitors out there is proof enough that this method of regulating protein function can be taken advantage of, but it’s worth keeping in mind that making specifically phosphorylated proteins can be a painful process if you don’t have a living cell or at least a tame enzyme to do it for you. That’s particularly true if you’re interested in one of the less-common phosphorylation sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have a very different sort of polarity modification, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenylation&quot;&gt;prenylation&lt;/a&gt;. Farnesyl (or geranyl-geranyl) groups are small lipophilic chains that get attached to proteins to modify their function and/or cellular localization. Proteins also get decorated with even longer lipid chains via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmitoylation&quot;&gt;palmitoylation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myristoylation&quot;&gt;myristoylation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s believed that these are generally involved in localizing things to membrane sites (as those greasy side chains settle into the lipid membrane). What’s for sure is that these modifications can make proteins rather tricky to work with (as is generally the case when you have a big polar/nonpolar structural separation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that you get to the proteins-modified-with-other-proteins class, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitination&lt;/a&gt; at the head of that class. Ubiquitin, as the name implies, is all over the place, and proteins get ubiquitinated (at lysine residues) to mark them for degradation, to mark them not to be degraded, to change their localization and interaction networks, and for who knows what else. It’s a huge topic, since there are lots of varieties of ubiquitin attachment, and if you think we’ve got them all figured out you are sadly mistaken. Then there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUMO_protein&quot;&gt;SUMOylation&lt;/a&gt;, another add-a-small-protein process that’s clearly important but which we understand even less. It’s less common than ubiquitination (we think!), but there are several different sorts of SUMO proteins and places that they can be attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m skipping over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-translational_modification&quot;&gt;several other&lt;/a&gt; post-translational modifications to get to a big class of them that I haven’t mentioned yet: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycosylation&quot;&gt;glycosylations&lt;/a&gt;. Sugar molecules (and chains of them) are stapled on to residues like tyrosine, starting with good old glucose and going on from there. These things can also be linked through amine and sometimes even SH residues, and that is just the beginning. I did my graduate work using carbohydrates as starting materials for organic synthesis, and anyone who’s worked with them will have some appreciation of the complications that are available. With all those open hydroxyls available, carbohydrates have a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycoside&quot;&gt;linking possibilities&lt;/a&gt; (some more common than others, naturally), and you have the alpha/beta anomeric centers for variety as well. Two naturally occurring amino acids can give you four peptides, but two naturally occurring sugars can give you a whole lot more disaccharides, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modifications are hugely important in proteins and many other biomolecules (including small-molecule natural products), but when I was in grad school, a lot of this was, chemically and biologically speaking, dark matter. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453015/&quot;&gt;A lot of it&lt;/a&gt; still is. Sometimes people would prefer just to ignor that part – even now, you’ll see total syntheses of some natural product as “whateverol aglycon”, that is, minus those pesky sugars. And when it comes to proteins, you almost have to rely on a living cell to glycosylate them properly, because chemically it can be a beast. A lot of chemical glycosylations are variations on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koenigs%E2%80%93Knorr_reaction&quot;&gt;Koenigs-Knorr&lt;/a&gt; reaction, with glycosyl halides, pseudohalides, and other leaving groups, and the number of variations on this is surely beyond counting. Holy cow, are there ever a lot of attempts to make glycosylation a better and more predictable reaction. My old “Lowe’s Laws of the Lab List” had one that went “&lt;em&gt;When there are twenty different ways of running a reaction in the literature, it means that there is no good way to run the reaction&lt;/em&gt;“, and the Koenigs-Knorr was what I had in mind. But it’s true: every time you vary the substrate being glycosylated or mess with the structure of the sugar part in any way, you can expect to see a new mixture of alpha/beta glycosides at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper I linked to so many paragraphs ago is a good shot, though, at taming this stuff for plain glucose-style glycosylation. The authors have a glycosyl fluoride protocol worked out (calcium hydroxide turns out to be a key addition) that seems to give pretty solid results on tyrosines (and phenols in general). What’s really impressive is that it works under aqueous conditions, using an unprotected sugar, and works on native (unprotected) proteins and peptides. It’s not perfect – you still get some glycosylation on other residues (serine, etc.), but it’s certainly the best I’ve ever seen. It would be interesting to see what happens when you try it on a protein with several possible tyrosines or with competing Cys residues, and I get the impression that the authors are heading there next. But even as it stands, this looks like a significantly better option than anything else out there for fast one-step glycosylation without messing around with protecting groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sorts of tools that are available for synthesizing, manipulating, and analyzing proteins and nucleic acids are (in general) just not available for carbohydrates. They either don’t exist anywhere or haven’t been domesticated from their biochemical forms. Only in recent years has the dream of automated polysaccharide synthesis come close &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/17/E3385&quot;&gt;to reality&lt;/a&gt;. Even in this paper, it’s worth noting that the authors weren’t really able to tell what all those other minor glycosylated side products were; it would be a major effort to run all those down. But this stuff is important, and every new technique that makes it easier to work in the area is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</originId><author><name>Rebecca Barwise-Munro</name></author><updated>1526936400000</updated><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>8a9917cd</fingerprint><published>1526936400000</published><title>Mortality and other outcomes after paediatric hospital admission on the weekend compared to weekday</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197494</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;
Mortality is higher for adults admitted to hospital and for babies born on weekends compared to weekdays. This study compares in-hospital mortality and in children admitted to hospital on weekends and weekdays. Details for all acute medical admissions to hospitals in Scotland for children aged ≤16 years between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2000 and 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2013 were obtained. Death was linked to day of admission. There were 570,403 acute medical admissions and 334 children died, including 83 who died after an admission on Saturday or Sunday and 251 who died following admission between Monday and Friday. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for a child dying after admission on a weekend compared to weekday was 1.03 [95% CI 0.80 to 1.32]. The OR for a child admitted over the weekend requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) care was 1.24 [1.16 to 1.32], but the absolute number of admissions to HDU and ICU per day were similar on weekends and weekdays. We see no evidence of increased in-hospital paediatric mortality after admission on a weekend. The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122a:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Barwise-Munro, Maryam Al-Mahtot, Steve Turner&lt;/p&gt;

The increased risk for admission to ITU or HDU with more serious illness over weekends is explained by fewer less serious admissions.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01176</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01176</originId><author><name>Takuhiro Otosu, Shoichi Yamaguchi</name></author><crawled>1527279087410</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01176/20180525/images/medium/jp-2018-01176k_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01176&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed2:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph. However, daily activity, the relative amplitude and the stability of the activity rhythm were lower in CFS/ME patients than in controls. DST was sensitive to environmental temperature and showed lower nocturnal values in CFS/ME patients than controls only in winter. A spectral analysis showed no differences in phase or amplitude of the 24h rhythm, but the power of the second harmonic (12h), revealed differences between groups (controls showed a post-lunch dip in activity and peak in DST, while CFS/ME patients did not) and correlated with clinical features. These findings suggest that circadian regulation and skin vasodilator responses may play a role in CFS/ME.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Trinitat Cambras, Jesús Castro-Marrero, Maria Cleofé Zaragoza, Antoni Díez-Noguera, José Alegre&lt;/p&gt;

Caesarean section (CS) has short and long term adverse health consequences, and should therefore only be undertaken when necessary. Risk factors such as maternal age, maternal body mass index (BMI) and fetal weight have been extensively investigated in relation to CS, but the significance of maternal height has been less explored in Sweden. The aim was to investigate the significance of maternal height on risk of CS in a representative, population-based sample from Sweden, also taking into account confounders. Data on singleton births in the Swedish Pregnancy Register 2011 to 2016 were collected, including women with heights of 140 cm and above, constituting a sample of 581,844 women. Data were analysed with epidemiological and biostatistical methods. Mean height was 166.1 cm. Women born outside Sweden were significantly shorter than women born in Sweden (162.8 cm vs. 167.1 cm, p&amp;lt;0.001). There was a decreasing risk of CS with increasing maternal height. This effect remained after adjustment for other risk factors for CS such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age, parity, high birth weight and country of birth. Frequency of CS was higher among women born outside Sweden compared with Swedish-born women (17.3% vs. 16.0%), however, in a multiple regression model country of birth outside Sweden diminished as a risk factor for CS. Maternal height of 178–179 cm was associated with the lowest risk of CS (OR = 0.76, CI95% 0.71–0.81), whereas height below 160 cm explained 7% of CS cases. BMI and maternal age are established factors involved in clinical assessments related to birth, and maternal height should increasingly enjoy a similar status in these considerations. Moreover, when healthcare professionals are counselling pregnant women, taller stature should be more emphasized as a positive indicator for successful vaginal birth to increase pregnant women’s confidence in giving birth vaginally, with possible positive impacts for lowering CS rates.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ingrid Mogren, Maria Lindqvist, Kerstin Petersson, Carin Nilses, Rhonda Small, Gabriel Granåsen, Kristina Edvardsson&lt;/p&gt;

The copolymers differed in their hard to soft segments ratio, from 70:30 to 50:50 wt.%. Enzymatic degradation was carried out on electrospun membranes (scaffolds) and compression-moulded films using lipase fromPseudomomas cepacia. Poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) was used as a reference aliphatic polyester. The degradation process was monitored gravimetrically via water uptake and mass loss. After 24 days, approx. 40% mass loss was observed for fibrous materials prepared from PBS-DLS 70:30 copolymer, as compared to approx. 10% mass loss for PBS-DLS 50:50. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and SEC analysis were used to examine changes in chemical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning light microscopy (LSM) revealed changes in degree of crystallinity, and changes in surface morphology, consistent with a surface erosion mechanism. We conclude that the obtained copolymers are suitable for tissue engineering applications thanks to tuneable degradation and lack of acidification during breakdown.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Enzymatic_Degradation_of_Candida_Antarctica_Lipase_B_Catalyzed_Poly_butylene_Succinate_Copolyesters_Containing_Dimer_Linoleic_Diol/6377555</href></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>2a7c30db</fingerprint><published>1527552000000</published><title>Enzymatic Degradation of Candida Antarctica Lipase B Catalyzed Poly(butylene Succinate) Copolyesters Containing Dimer Linoleic Diol</title><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Biodegradable polymers are an active area of investigation, particularly ones that can be produced from sustainable, biobased monomers, such as copolymers of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS).

After 24 days, approx. 40% mass loss was observed for fibrous materials prepared from PBS-DLS 70:30 copolymer, as compared to approx. 10% mass loss for PBS-DLS 50:50. Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and SEC analysis were used to examine changes in chemical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning light microscopy (LSM) revealed changes in degree of crystallinity, and changes in surface morphology, consistent with a surface erosion mechanism. We conclude that the obtained copolymers are suitable for tissue engineering applications thanks to tuneable degradation and lack of acidification during breakdown.</content></summary><unread>True</unread><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163ac478153:1f835c9:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00205</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00205</originId><author><name>Zhiyuan Ma, X.

Because such experiments are resource-intensive and frequently push the limits of sensitivity of the measurement techniques, optimization of experiment design can improve feasibility with respect to financial and labor costs, time to completion, and increase precision and accuracy of the results. Here we used a previously published set of data acquired in cultured insulinoma cells to evaluate contributions to the sensitivity and variability of the rate of citrate synthase (CS). Specifically, we calculated changes in uncertainty in CS if sample times were dropped or new ones were added, and we observed that some sampling times can be dropped with little effect, while improvements can be made with a strategic choice of when to add samples. We measured the contributions of data sampled at different times on the sensitivity of CS, finding that CS had greater sensitivity at early time points. We tested the concept that if two estimated parameters are correlated significantly, then refining one might constrain the other. In this case, the rate of Beta-ox was found to be correlated with CS, and narrower variability in Beta-ox did indeed improve the sensitivity of CS. The tests described here might be applied at the initial design stage and then after a pilot phase to improve sensitivities of targeted fluxes and the reduction of materials, time, labor, and other experimental resources. The correlation analyses can be used to consider what orthogonal measurements might be beneficial for further improvement of measurements.

Most Malawian women who start ART under Option B+ are still in care three years later, a higher than average adherence rate for life-threatening chronic disease treatments, worldwide (50%). We asked 75 Malawian on ART their motivations for remaining in treatment, and what barriers they overcame. Focus groups and interviews included 75 women on ART for 6+ months, at 12 health facilities. Four main motivations for continuing ART emerged: 1) evidence that ART improved their own and their children’s health; 2) strong desire to be healthy and keep their children healthy; 3) treatment was socially supported; 4) HIV/ART counselling effectively showed benefits of ART and told women what to expect. Women surmounted the following barriers: 1) stigma; 2) health care system; 3) economic; 4) side effects. Women stayed on ART because they believed it works. Future interventions should focus on emphasizing ART’s effectiveness, along with other services they provide.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f47:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nozgechi Phiri, Andreas D.

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80\% reliable.

Food security has always been a focus issue in China. Farmland consolidation (FC) was regarded as a critical way to increase the quantity and improve the quality of farmland to ensure food security by Chinese government. FC projects have been nationwide launched, however few studies focused on evaluating the effectiveness of FC at a national scale. As such, an efficient way to evaluate the effectiveness of FC on improving agricultural productivity in China will be needed and it is critical for future national land consolidation planning. In this study, we selected 7505 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2013 with good quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as samples to evaluate the effectiveness of FC. We used time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI from 2001 to 2013, to extract four indicators to characterize agricultural productivity change of 4442 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2010, i.e., productivity level (PL), productivity variation (PV), productivity potential (PP), and multi-cropping index (MI). On this basis, we further predicted the same four characteristics for 3063 FC projects completed between 2011 and 2013, respectively, using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found FC showed an overall effective status on improving agricultural productivity between 2006 and 2013 in China, especially on upgrading PL and improving PP. The positive effect was more prominent in the southeast and eastern China. It is noteworthy that 27.30% of all the 7505 projects were still ineffective on upgrading PL, the elementary improvement of agricultural productivity. Finally, we proposed that location-specific factors should be taken into consideration for launching FC projects and diverse financial sources are also needed for supporting FC. The results provide a reference for government to arrange FC projects reasonably and to formulate land consolidation planning in a proper way that better improve the effectiveness of FC.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yeting Fan, Xiaobin Jin, Xiaomin Xiang, Le Gan, Xuhong Yang, Zhihong Zhang, Yinkang Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094073:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Desiree R.

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis.

Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b788:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akinobu Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids.

The purple sea urchin, &lt;i&gt;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&lt;/i&gt;, has a complex and robust immune system that is mediated by a number of multi-gene families including the &lt;i&gt;SpTransformer&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt;) gene family (formerly &lt;i&gt;Sp185/333&lt;/i&gt;). In response to immune challenge from bacteria and various pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the &lt;i&gt;SpTrf&lt;/i&gt; genes are up-regulated in sea urchin phagocytes and express a diverse array of SpTrf proteins. We show here that SpTrf proteins from coelomocytes and isolated by nickel affinity (cNi-SpTrf) bind to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and to Baker’s yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, with saturable kinetics and specificity. cNi-SpTrf opsonization of the marine bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Vibrio diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt;, augments phagocytosis, however, opsonization by the recombinant protein, rSpTrf-E1, does not. Binding by cNi-SpTrf proteins retards growth rates significantly for several species of bacteria. SpTrf proteins, previously thought to be strictly membrane-associated, are secreted from phagocytes in short term cultures and bind &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diazotrophicus&lt;/i&gt; that are located both outside of and within phagocytes. Our results demonstrate anti-microbial activities of native SpTrf proteins and suggest variable functions among different SpTrf isoforms. Multiple isoforms may act synergistically to detect a wide array of pathogens and provide flexible and efficient host immunity.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475053:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hung-Yen Chou, Cheng Man Lun, L.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721e:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635ff59cc6:31f8d4d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b78:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lyn M.

The optimized geometries revealed that the lowest energy structures of the NiCun–1 and Ni2Cun–2 clusters favor the Ni atom(s) situated at the most highly coordinated position of the host copper clusters. The averaged binding energy, the fragmentation energies and the second‐order energy differences signified that the Ni doped clusters can continue to gain an energy during the growth process. The electronic structures revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies of the LC‐DFT are reliable and can be used to predict the vertical ionization potential and the vertical electron affinity of the systems. The reactivity descriptors such as the chemical potential, chemical hardness and electrophilic power, and the reactivity principle such as the minimum polarizability principle are operative for characterizing and rationalizing the electronic structures of these clusters.

Wild peanut relatives (&lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are genetically diverse and were selected throughout evolution to a range of environments constituting, therefore, an important source of allelic diversity for abiotic stress tolerance. In particular, &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;, the parents of the reference &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; A-genome genetic map, show contrasting transpiration behavior under limited water conditions. This study aimed to build a comprehensive gene expression profile of these two wild species under dehydration stress caused by the withdrawal of hydroponic nutrient solution. For this purpose, roots of both genotypes were collected at seven time-points during the early stages of dehydration and used to construct cDNA paired-end libraries. Physiological analyses indicated initial differences in gas exchange parameters between the drought-tolerant genotype of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and the drought-sensitive genotype of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;. High-quality Illumina reads were mapped against the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; reference genome and resulted in the identification of 1,235 and 799 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) that responded to the stress treatment in roots of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;stenosperma&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Further analysis, including functional annotation and identification of biological pathways represented by these DEGs confirmed the distinct gene expression behavior of the two contrasting &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; species genotypes under dehydration stress. Some species-exclusive and common DEGs were then selected for qRT-PCR analysis, which corroborated the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; expression profiling. These included genes coding for regulators and effectors involved in drought tolerance responses, such as activation of osmosensing molecular cascades, control of hormone and osmolyte content, and protection of macromolecules. This dataset of transcripts induced during the dehydration process in two wild &lt;i&gt;Arachis&lt;/i&gt; genotypes constitute new tools for the understanding of the distinct gene regulation processes in these closely related species but with contrasting drought responsiveness.

Eligible subjects were categorized into the following three groups according to ACS exposure: non-user (n = 53), partial-course (n = 44), and complete-course (n = 50). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to compare neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidities including intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and neurodevelopmental impairment including cerebral palsy among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Neonatal mortality rate was significantly lower in the ACS-user groups (non-user, 52.8%; partial-course, 27.3%; complete-course, 28.0%; P = 0.01), but complete-course of ACS therapy had no advantages over partial-course. A lower incidence of IVH was observed in the complete-course group (non-users, 54.8%; partial-course, 48.6%; complete-course, 20.5%; P = 0.003). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ACS therapy, either partial- or complete-course, was associated with a lower rate of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.375; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.141–0.996 in partial-course; aOR 0.173; 95% CI 0.052–0.574) in complete-course). IVH (aOR 0.191; 95% CI 0.071–0.516) was less likely to occur in the complete-course group than in the non-user group. Neurodevelopmental impairment of survivors at 18–22 month after birth was not significantly different among the three groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ACS therapy in preterm births at 21–23 weeks of gestation was associated with significantly reduced rates of neonatal mortality and IVH, especially with complete administration.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78d:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seon-Mi Kim, Ji-Hee Sung, Jin-Yi Kuk, Hyun-Hwa Cha, Suk-Joo Choi, Soo-young Oh, Cheong-Rae Roh&lt;/p&gt;

Colorectal epithelial tumors occur spontaneously in dogs, and the pathogenesis seems to parallel that of humans. The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Peptostreptococcus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt;, and lower abundance of &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clostridium&lt;/i&gt; XI and &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/i&gt;. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Roseburia&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaeceae&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oscillibacter&lt;/i&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is minimal invasive techniques to reconstruct the vertebral height and prevent further collapse of the fractured vertebrae by injecting polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral body. However, recompression of polymethylmethacrylate augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggressive local kyphotic was observed frequently after VP or KP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential risk factors associated with polymethylmethacrylate distribution for recompression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and six (37.7%) patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period. The polymethylmethacrylate distributed in the middle of vertebral body showed significant differences between two groups. In non-recompression group, the polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body were closer to endplates than that in the recompression group (upper: t = 31.41, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001; lower: t = 12.19, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The higher percentage of the height of polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body indicates the lower risk of recompression (odds ratio [OR]&amp;lt;0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The recompression group and non-recompression group showed significant difference in “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern (polymethylmethacrylate contacted to the both upper/lower endplates) (&lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 66.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The vertebra with a “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern has lower risk of recompression (OR = 0.09, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Either more polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body or “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern had a significantly less incidence of recompression. The findings indicated that the control of polymethylmethacrylate distribution during surgery may reduce the risks of recompression after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84550:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Hou, Qi Yao, Genai Zhang, Lixiang Ding, Hui Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd77:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin N.

The earlier COSMO cavity construction algorithms are described for comparison. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1636067cc1a:32b4e7f:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325415v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325415v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Shen, Y.</name></author><crawled>1526634098576</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325415v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>d3a4eca1</fingerprint><published>1526626800000</published><title>RefCell: Multi-dimensional analysis of image-based high-throughput screens based on &apos;typical cells&apos; [CONFIRMATORY RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/325415</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Background: Image-based high-throughput screening (HTS) reveals a high level of heterogeneity in single cells and multiple cellular states may be observed within a single population.

&lt;i&gt;Trichinella spiralis&lt;/i&gt; mainly dwells in the muscle tissue of its host and is the main causative agent of trichinellosis in humans. Nitric oxide (NO), an important intracellular signaling molecule that may restrict pathogen growth in infected hosts, has been known for its anti-pathogenic activity, including resistance to &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;spiralis&lt;/i&gt;.

Of the 1,476 proteins detected in the ML, 121 proteins showed differential expression, including 50 significantly upregulated and 71 downregulated proteins. The functions of the 108 annotated proteins were primarily related to signal transduction, transcription/translation, material metabolism, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, and stress/defense/antioxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay verified that FRMD5 and CUT-1 gene expression levels were significantly increased, while COX2 gene expression level was significantly decreased. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the molecular function of the catalytic activity, biological process of the immune system process, metabolic process, cellular component organization, biological adhesion, and cellular component of the macromolecular complex.

Jill E.Gready</name></author><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><description>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis. In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6d6d5eb6</fingerprint><published>1526281661000</published><title>Revised mechanism of carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate by rubisco from large scale quantum chemical calculations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis.

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass.

Further work is needed to grasp the virulence and fitness mechanisms adopted by &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; causing APN, and hence develop new therapeutic and prophylactic approaches.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-f?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-f?rss=1</originId><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-f?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>f3736971</fingerprint><published>1527788426000</published><title>Arenes get a light boost onto copper</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/976.6.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09af:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</originId><author><name>Anniina Keskitalo</name></author><updated>1527714000000</updated><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>eaddb019</fingerprint><published>1527714000000</published><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&amp;lt;/i&gt; administration induces hepatic damage and subcutaneous fat accumulation in high-fat diet fed mice</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anniina Keskitalo, Eveliina Munukka, Raine Toivonen, Maija Hollmén, Heikki Kainulainen, Pentti Huovinen, Sirpa Jalkanen, Satu Pekkala&lt;/p&gt;
Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a significant role in obesity, insulin resistance and associated liver disorders. Family &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and especially &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt; strain B29 have been previously linked to obesity and hepatic damage. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC® 13047™) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment groups. The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels.

Jill E.Gready</name></author><crawled>1526330805274</crawled><description>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis. In the 5‐step carboxylase reaction, the substrate Ribulose‐1,5‐bisphosphate (RuBP) first binds Rubisco and undergoes enolization before binding the second substrate, CO2. Hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex is followed by CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation. However, details of the roles and protonation states of active‐site residues, and sources of protons and water, remain highly speculative. Large‐scale computations on active‐site models provide a means to better understand this complex chemical mechanism. The computational protocol comprises a combination of hybrid semi‐empirical quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics within constrained molecular dynamics simulations, together with constrained gradient minimization calculations using density functional theory. Alternative pathways for hydration of the RuBP.CO2 complex and associated active‐site protonation networks and proton and water sources were investigated. The main findings from analysis of the resulting energetics advocate major revision to existing mechanisms such that: hydration takes place anti to the CO2; both hydration and CC bond scission require early protonation of CO2 in the RuBP.CO2 complex; CC bond scission and stereospecific protonation reactions are concerted and, effectively, there is only one stable intermediate, the C3‐gemdiolate complex. Our main conclusions for interpreting enzyme kinetic results are that the gemdiolate may represent the elusive Michaelis–Menten‐like complex corresponding to the empirical Km (=Kc) with turnover to product via bond scission concerted with stereospecific protonation consistent with the observed catalytic rate. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25343?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>60a40e84</fingerprint><published>1526281661000</published><title>Revised mechanism of carboxylation of ribulose‐1,5‐biphosphate by rubisco from large scale quantum chemical calculations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Here, we describe a computational approach for studying enzymes that catalyze complex multi‐step reactions and apply it to Ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme that fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide within photosynthesis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods. SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475058:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto, Rozenn N.

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via formal pharmacological studies.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163745b5a71:521e72b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing conditions.

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bb:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

Background/Aims &lt;p&gt;Typical approach for increasing apheresis platelet collections is to recruit new donors. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an alternative strategy: optimizing donor scheduling, prior to recruitment, at a hospital-based blood donor center.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analysis of collections, during the 89 consecutive months since opening of donor center, was performed. Linear regression and segmented time-series analyses were performed to calculate growth rates of collections and to test for statistical differences, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pre-intervention donor scheduling capacity was 39/month. In the absence of active donor recruitment, during the first 29 months, the number of collections rose gradually to 24/month (growth-rate of 0.70/month). However, between month-30 and -55, collections exhibited a plateau at 25.6 ± 3.0 (growth-rate of -0.09/month) (p&amp;lt;0.0001). This plateau-phase coincided with donor schedule approaching saturation (65.6 ± 7.6% schedule booked). Scheduling capacity was increased by following two interventions: adding an apheresis instrument (month-56) and adding two more collection days/week (month-72). Consequently, the scheduling capacity increased to 130/month. Post-interventions, apheresis platelet collections between month-56 and -81 exhibited a spontaneous renewed growth at a rate of 0.62/month (p&amp;lt;0.0001), in absence of active donor recruitment. Active donor recruitment in month-82 and -86, when the donor schedule had been optimized to accommodate further growth, resulted in a dramatic but transient surge in collections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Apheresis platelet collections plateau at nearly 2/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of the scheduling capacity. Optimizing the scheduling capacity prior to active donor recruitment is an effective strategy to increase platelet collections at a hospital-based donor center.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb91c:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Parvez M.

The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of &gt;99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c18:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Krishanu Nandy, David W.

Bacterial blight (BB) in rice caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas oryzae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt;) is a major global production constraint, particularly in irrigated and rain-fed lowland areas.

Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyse protein cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chain of a glutamine residue on one protein and the side chain of a lysine residue on another. Generally, TGases show low substrate specificity with respect to their amine substrate, such that a wide variety of primary amines can participate in the modification of specific glutamine residue. Although a number of different TGases have been used to mediate these bioconjugation reactions, the TGase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (bTG) may be particularly suited to this application. It is smaller than most TGases, can be expressed in a soluble active form, and lacks the calcium dependence of its mammalian counterparts. However, little is known regarding this enzyme and its glutamine substrate specificity, limiting the scope of its application. In this work, we designed a FRET-based ligation assay to monitor the bTG-mediated conjugation of the fluorescent proteins Clover and mRuby2. This assay allowed us to screen a library of random heptapeptide glutamine sequences for their reactivity with recombinant bTG in bacterial cells, using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. From this library, several reactive sequences were identified and kinetically characterized, with the most reactive sequence (YAHQAHY) having a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19 ± 3 μM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This sequence was then genetically appended onto a test protein as a reactive ‘Q-tag’ and fluorescently labelled with dansyl-cadaverine, in the first demonstration of protein labelling mediated by bTG.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb917:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel K.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues.

Mortality information of populations is aggregated in life tables that serve as a basis for calculation of life expectancy and various life disparity measures. Conventional life-table methods address right-censoring inadequately by assuming a constant hazard in the last open-ended age group. As a result, life expectancy can be substantially distorted, especially in the case when the last age group in a life table contains a large proportion of the population. Previous research suggests addressing censoring in a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model setting as this framework incorporates all major features of adult mortality. In this article, we quantify the difference between gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy values and those published in the largest publicly available high-quality life-table databases for human populations, drawing attention to populations for which life expectancy values should be reconsidered. We also advocate the use of gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy for three reasons. First, model-based life-expectancy calculation successfully handles the problem of data quality or availability, resulting in severe censoring due to the unification of a substantial number of deaths in the last open-end age group. Second, model-based life expectancies are preferable in the case of data scarcity, i.e. when data contain numerous age groups with zero death counts: here, we provide an example of hunter-gatherer populations. Third, gamma-Gompertz-Makeham-based life expectancy values are almost identical to the ones provided by the major high-quality human mortality databases that use more complicated procedures. Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b790:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by László Németh, Trifon I.

Pathogen load determines the outcome of many infections, and is a consequence of pathogen multiplication rate, duration of the infection, and inhibition or killing of pathogen by the host (resistance).

In contrast, the type 1 interferon response and expression of CXCL10 (IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) were detrimental to control of parasite growth. Natural variation in iron status and plasma levels of complement factor H were determinants of parasite multiplication rate.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475060:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lisiery N.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

In this work, a novel machine learning model, SPRINT‐Mal, is developed to predict malonylation sites by employing sequence and predicted structural features. Evolutionary information and physicochemical properties are found to be the two most discriminative features whereas a structural feature called half‐sphere exposure provides additional improvement to the prediction performance. SPRINT‐Mal trained on mouse data yields robust performance for 10‐fold cross validation and independent test set with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.74 and 0.76 and Matthews’ Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.213 and 0.20, respectively. Moreover, SPRINT‐Mal achieved comparable performance when testing on H. sapiens proteins without species‐specific training but not in bacterium S. erythraea.

For both patient and graft survival, we estimated univariable and multivariable Gray’s TVC, retaining significant covariates based on backward selection. We then estimated the same specification using traditional Cox proportional hazards (PH) models and compared our findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For patient survival, covariates included recipient diagnosis, age, race/ethnicity, ventilator support, encephalopathy, creatinine levels, use of living donor, and donor age. Only the effects of recipient diagnosis and donor age were constant; effects of other covariates varied over time. We retained identical covariates in the graft survival model but found several differences in their impact.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The flexibility afforded by Gray’s TVC estimation methods identify several covariates that do not satisfy constant proportionality assumptions of the Cox PH model. Incorporating better survival estimates is critical for improving risk prediction tools used by the transplant community to inform organ allocation decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b942:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cindy L.

However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs. Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b24cc47c:29d8098:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in many biological processes and diseases has gained intense interests over the past several years.

Millions of people worldwide currently suffer from serious neurological diseases and injuries for which there are few, and often no, effective treatments. The paucity of effective interventions is, no doubt, due in large part to the complexity of the disorders, as well as our currently limited understanding of their pathophysiology. The bleak picture for patients, however, is also attributable to avoidable impediments stemming from quality concerns in preclinical research that often escape detection by research regulation efforts. In our essay, we connect the dots between these concerns about the quality of preclinical research and their potential ethical impact on the patients who volunteer for early trials of interventions informed by it. We do so in hopes that a greater appreciation among preclinical researchers of these serious ethical consequences can lead to a greater commitment within the research community to adopt widely available tools and measures that can help to improve the quality of research.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fW_TBERyuhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163d6461503:1bc34f1:c2c34441</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mark Yarborough, Annelien Bredenoord, Flavio D’Abramo, Nanette C.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phase–promoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ajE-XA15ViE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1634b38b8d6:499b84:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles A.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04148-1</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04148-1</originId><author><name>Julia Ramírez</name></author><crawled>1526462812398</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/At03Mmk5x3s/s41467-018-04148-1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04148-1</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>747cf60c</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>Thirty loci identified for heart rate response to exercise and recovery implicate autonomic nervous system</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thirty loci identified for heart rate response to exercise and recovery implicate autonomic nervous system&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty loci identified for heart rate response to exercise and recovery implicate autonomic nervous system, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04148-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04148-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci for resting heart rate (HR) but the genetic factors associated with HR increase during and HR recovery after exercise are less well studied.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases, but detection and treatment rates are low. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values from brain computed tomography (CT) scans and T-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with &amp;lt; 1 year between brain CT and DXA scans were included in the study. The average frontal skull HU value used for analysis was defined as the average of four HU values of the frontal bone. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the HU values of the frontal skull for predicting osteoporosis. The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between skull HU value and T-score (β = 105.06, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.343). The mean HU value in subjects with osteoporosis was 515, and the optimal cutoff value for the prediction of osteoporosis was 610 HU (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.744–0.806, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Clinical brain CT scans can assist in the detection of osteoporosis, and patients with an HU value &amp;lt; 610 as determined via brain CT may be considered for further evaluation for possible osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ed:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Min Kyun Na, Yu Deok Won, Choong Hyun Kim, Jae Min Kim, Jin Hwan Cheong, Je Il Ryu, Myung-Hoon Han&lt;/p&gt;

Six fungal-type cellulose binding domains were found in the genome of the coccolithophore &lt;i&gt;Emiliania huxleyi&lt;/i&gt; and cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. Sequence comparison indicate high similarity to fungal cellulose binding domains, raising the question of why these domains exist in coccolithophores. The proteins were tested for binding with cellulose and chitin as ligands, which resulted in the identification of two functional carbohydrate binding modules: EHUX2 and EHUX4. Compared to benchmark fungal cellulose binding domain Cel7A-CBM1 from &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma reesei&lt;/i&gt;, these proteins showed slightly lower binding to birch and bacterial cellulose, but were more efficient chitin binders. Finally, a set of cellulose binding domains was created based on the shuffling of one well-functioning and one non-functional domain. These were characterized in order to get more information of the binding domain’s sequence–function relationship, indicating characteristic differences between the molecular basis of cellulose versus chitin recognition. As previous reports have showed the presence of cellulose in coccoliths and here we find functional cellulose binding modules, a possible connection is discussed.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761240:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bart J.

Through extensive validation of the model, including the use of multiple species sequence similarity and mass spectrometry, the effectiveness of the model is highlighted.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</originId><author><name>Joana Costa-Gouveia</name></author><crawled>1525940317057</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/2cAwf6pBIME/s41598-018-25177-2</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>6a3df55d</fingerprint><published>1525935600000</published><title>Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16349216b81:11b4d48:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238</originId><author><name>Lucie Jiraskova, Lukas Cerveny, Sara Karbanova, Zuzana Ptackova, Frantisek Staud</name></author><crawled>1527280342650</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238/20180525/images/medium/mp-2018-00238h_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an established primary treatment for newly diagnosed brain metastases with high local control rates. However, data about local re-irradiation in case of local failure after SRS (re-SRS) are rare. We evaluated the feasibility, efficacy and patient selection characteristics in treating locally recurrent metastases with a second course of SRS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases treated with re-SRS for local tumor progression between 2011 and 2017. Patient and treatment characteristics as well as rates of tumor control, survival and toxicity were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, 32 locally recurrent brain metastases in 31 patients were irradiated with re-SRS. Median age at re-SRS was 64.9 years. The primary histology was breast cancer and non-small-cellular lung cancer (NSCLC) in respectively 10 cases (31.3%), in 5 cases malignant melanoma (15.6%). In the first SRS-course 19 metastases (59.4%) and in the re-SRS-course 29 metastases (90.6%) were treated with CyberKnife&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and the others with Gamma Knife. Median planning target volume (PTV) for re-SRS was 2.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (range, 0.1–37.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and median dose prescribed to the PTV was 19 Gy (range, 12–28 Gy) in 1–5 fractions to the median 69% isodose (range, 53–80%). The 1-year overall survival rate was 61.7% and the 1-year local control rate was 79.5%. The overall rate of radiological radio-necrosis was 16.1% and four patients (12.9%) experienced grade ≥ 3 toxicities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases after prior local SRS appears to be feasible with acceptable toxicity and can be considered as salvage treatment option for selected patients with high performance status. Furthermore, this is the first study utilizing robotic radiosurgery for this indication, as an additional option for frameless fractionated treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f59:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Panagiotis Balermpas, Susanne Stera, Jens Müller von der Grün, Britta Loutfi-Krauss, Marie-Thérèse Forster, Marlies Wagner, Christian Keller, Claus Rödel, Volker Seifert, Oliver Blanck, Robert Wolff&lt;/p&gt;

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df5:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Priesemann, Oren Shriki&lt;/p&gt;

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163b74c18e7:c75cd:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anton V.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

The simulation of the interface between two different 2D materials is computationally challenging due to the lattice mismatch problem, which sometimes necessitates the creation of very large simulation cells for performing density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The simulation of the interface between two different 2D materials is computationally challenging due to the lattice mismatch problem, which sometimes necessitates the creation of very large simulation cells for performing density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here we use a combination of DFT, linear regression and machine learning techniques in order to rapidly determine the interlayer distance between two different 2D heterostructures that are stacked in a bilayer heterostructure, as well as the band gap of the bilayer.

General practice has an important role within the Australian healthcare system to provide access to care and effective management of chronic health conditions. However, people with serious mental illness experience challenges associated with service access. The current paper seeks to examine drivers of access to general practice for people with common and serious mental disorders, compared with people who access care for type II diabetes, a common physical health problem managed in general practice. The Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) programme provides the most comprehensive and objective measurement of general practitioner activity in Australia. Using BEACH data, this study compared general practice encounters for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and type II diabetes during a 10-year period between 2006 and 2016. Analysis revealed more frequent encounters for depression compared to anxiety, and a higher representation of women in encounters for bipolar disorder compared to men. The relationship between number of encounters and patient age was strongly associated with the life course and mortality characteristics associated with each disorder. The findings highlight specific challenges associated with access to primary care for people with serious mental illness, and suggest areas of focus to improve the ability of these patients to access and navigate the health system.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454f:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louise M.

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise.

Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-j?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-j?rss=1</originId><author><name>Purnell, B.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A.
