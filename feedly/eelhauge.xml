Cryopreservation of oocytes would serve as an alternative to overcome the limited availability of dromedary camel oocytes and facilitate improvements in IVP techniques in this species. Our goal was to develop a protocol for the vitrification of camel oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage using different cryoprotectant combinations: 20% EG and 20% DMSO (VS1), 25% EG plus 25% DMSO (VS2) or 25% EG and 25% glycerol (VS3) and various cryo-carriers; straws or open pulled-straw (OPS) or solid surface vitrification (SSV); and Cryotop. Viable oocytes were cultured in vitro for 30 h. Matured oocytes were fertilized with epididymal spermatozoa and then cultured in vitro in modified KSOMaa medium for 7 days. Survival and nuclear maturation rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in oocytes exposed to VS3 (44.8% and 34.0%, respectively) than those exposed to VS1 (68.2% and 48.0%, respectively) and VS2 (79.3% and 56.9%, respectively). Although recovery rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in SSV and Cryotop vitrified oocytes (66.9% to 71.1%) than those vitrified by straws with VS1 or VS2 solutions (86.3% to 91.0%), survival rates were higher in the SSV and Cryotop groups (90.7% to 94.8%) than in the straw and OPS groups (68.2% to 86.5%). Among vitrified groups, maturation and fertilization rates were the highest in the Cryotop-VS2 group (51.8% and 39.2%, respectively). These values were comparable to those seen in the controls (59.2% and 44.6%, respectively). Cleavage (22.5% to 27.9%), morula (13.2% to 14.5%), and blastocyst (6.4% to 8.5%) rates were significantly higher (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in SSV and Cryotop groups than in straws. No significant differences were observed in these parameters between the Cryotop and control groups.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a progressive loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovial inflammation and is the most common chronic condition worldwide today. However, most treatments have focused on pain relief and OA symptoms. For these reasons, many ongoing studies are currently trying to develop efficient and successful therapies based on its pathology. Animal models that mimic the histopathology and symptoms of OA have a critical role in OA research and make it possible to investigate both secondary osteoarthritic changes due to a precedent event such as traumatic injury and naturally occurring changes for the development of therapeutics which can be tested in preclinical and clinical OA trials. We induced OA in various animal models including rats, rabbits and guinea pigs by chemical, surgical and naturally occurring methods. In particular, the Dunkin-Hartley guinea pig is very attractive as an OA animal model because OA slowly progresses which is similar to human primary OA. Thus, this animal model mimics the pathophysiological process and environment of human primary OA. Besides the spontaneous OA model, anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) as well as a chemical technique using sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) were used to induce OA. We found that ACLT in the rat model induced OA changes in the histology and micro-CT image compared to OVX. The osteoarthritic change significantly increased following ACLT surgery in the rabbit model. Furthermore, we identified that OA pathogenic changes occurred in a time-dependent manner in spontaneous Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs. The MIA injection model is a rapid and minimally invasive method for inducing OA in animal models, whereas the spontaneous OA model has a slow and gradual progression of OA similar to human primary OA. We observed that histological OA change was extraordinarily increased at 9 ½ months in the spontaneous OA model, and thus, the grade was similar with that of the MIA model. Therefore, this study reports on OA pathology using various animal models as well as the spontaneous results naturally occurring in an OA animal model which had developed cartilage lesions and progressive osteoarthritic changes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Ji Eun Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194288</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d69:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>496f38ce</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Eun Kim, Da-hyun Song, Soo Hyun Kim, Youngmee Jung, Sang Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

By integrating constraint-based models and tools from network science, our framework allows the study of context-specific metabolic responses at a system level beyond standard pathway descriptions.</description><published>1522393200000</published><title>Flux-dependent graphs for metabolic networks [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196028</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196028</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196028</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Giorgia Antoni, Elisabetta Marini, Nicoletta Curreli, Valerio Tuveri, Ornella Comandini, Stefano Cabras, Silvia Gabba, Clelia Madeddu, Antonio Crisafulli, Andrea C.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt;, or in the autoinflammatory &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; genes, concur with &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; in enhancing the risk of Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and/or in predicting the response to anti-TNFα treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;373 controls and 137 SpA (82 with Psoriatic Arthritis-PsA and 55 with Ankylosing Spondylitis- AS; 98/137 under TNFα inhibitor therapy) from the Veneto Region (Italy) were studied. &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms (-1031T&gt;C;-857C&gt;T;-376G&gt;A;-308G&gt;A;-238G&gt;A) and &lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; were assayed by RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,5 and 10) and &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2,3,4 and 6) genes were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HLA-B27&lt;/i&gt; was associated with AS (χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 120.1; p = 0.000). Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be overcome by electrical stimulation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) via a cochlear implant (CI). Restricted CI performance results from the spatial gap between the SGNs and the electrode, but the efficacy of CI is also limited by the degeneration of SGNs as one consequence of SHNL. In the healthy cochlea, the survival of SGNs is assured by endogenous neurotrophic support. Several applications of exogenous neurotrophic supply have been shown to reduce SGN degeneration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In the present study, nanoporous silica nanoparticles (NPSNPs), with an approximate diameter of &amp;lt;100 nm, were loaded with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to test their efficacy as long-term delivery system for neurotrophins. The neurotrophic factor was released constantly from the NPSNPs over a release period of 80 days when the surface of the nanoparticles had been modified with amino groups. Cell culture investigations with NIH3T3 fibroblasts attest a good general cytocompatibility of the NPSNPs. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments with SGNs indicate a significantly higher survival rate of SGNs in cell cultures that contained BDNF-loaded nanoparticles compared to the control culture with unloaded NPSNPs (p&amp;lt;0.001). Importantly, also the amounts of BDNF released up to a time period of 39 days increased the survival rate of SGNs. Thus, NPSNPs carrying BDNF are suitable for the treatment of inner ear disease and for the protection and the support of SGNs. Their nanoscale nature and the fact that a direct contact of the nanoparticles and the SGNs is not necessary for neuroprotective effects, should allow for the facile preparation of nanocomposites, e.g., with biocompatible polymers, to install coatings on implants for the realization of implant-based growth factor delivery systems.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Nadeschda Schmidt</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194778</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f0a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>8ab24b99</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadeschda Schmidt, Jennifer Schulze, Dawid P.

Urbanization is a global process that has taken billions of people from the rural countryside to concentrated urban centers, adding pressure to existing water resources. Many cities are specifically reliant on renewable freshwater regularly refilled by precipitation, rather than fossil groundwater or desalination. A precipitationshed can be considered the “watershed of the sky” and identifies the origin of precipitation falling in a given region. In this paper, we use this concept to determine the sources of precipitation that supply renewable water in the watersheds of the largest cities of the world. We quantify the sources of precipitation for 29 megacities and analyze their differences between dry and wet years. Our results reveal that 19 of 29 megacities depend for more than a third of their water supply on evaporation from land. We also show that for many of the megacities, the terrestrial dependence is higher in dry years. This high dependence on terrestrial evaporation for their precipitation exposes these cities to potential land-use change that could reduce the evaporation that generates precipitation. Combining indicators of water stress, moisture recycling exposure, economic capacity, vegetation-regulated evaporation, land-use change, and dry-season moisture recycling sensitivity reveals four highly vulnerable megacities (Karachi, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing). A further six megacities were found to have medium vulnerability with regard to their water supply. We conclude that understanding how upwind landscapes affect downwind municipal water resources could be a key component for understanding the complexity of urban water security.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Patrick W.

Until recently, the method of choice to characterize viral diversity consisted in cloning PCR amplicons of full-length viral genomes and Sanger-sequencing of multiple clones. However, this is extremely laborious, time-consuming, and low-throughput. Next generation short-read sequencing appears also limited by its inability to directly sequence full-length viral genomes. The MinION&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; device recently developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies can be a promising alternative by applying long-read single-molecule sequencing directly to the overall amplified products generated in a PCR reaction. This new technology was evaluated by using hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a model. Several previously characterized HBV-infected clinical samples were investigated including recombinant virus, variants that harbored deletions and mixed population. Original MinION device was able to generate individual complete 3,200-nt HBV genome sequences and to identify recombinant variants. MinION was particularly efficient in detecting HBV genomes with multiple large in-frame deletions and spliced variants concomitantly with non-deleted parental genomes. However, an average-12% sequencing error rate per individual reads associated to a low throughput challenged single-nucleotide resolution, polymorphism calling and phasing mutations directly from the sequencing reads. Despite this high error rate, the pairwise identity of MinION HBV consensus genome was consistent with Sanger sequencing method. MinION being under continuous development, further studies are needed to evaluate its potential use for viral infection characterization.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Virginie Sauvage</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194366</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123921:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>afcd0df5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Virginie Sauvage, Laure Boizeau, Daniel Candotti, Mathias Vandenbogaert, Annabelle Servant-Delmas, Valérie Caro, Syria Laperche&lt;/p&gt;

With over 1 million species on earth, each biologically unique, do we have any hope of understanding whether species will persist in a warming world? We might, because it turns out that there is surprising regularity in how warming accelerates the major metabolic processes that power life. A persistent challenge has been to understand ecological effects of temperature in the context of species interactions, especially when individuals not only experience temperature but also mortality due to parasitism or predation. Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005628</href></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005628</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16287756338:cba3d:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522691040056</crawled><fingerprint>f84e6dc5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary I.

Kirk et al. have shown how the effects of parasites vary with warming in a manner entirely consistent with general temperature dependence of host and parasite metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/u5e7Nju7vII&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522691102456</recrawled><published>1522702800000</published><title>The metabolic theory of ecology and the cost of parasitism</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965</originId><author><name>Peng Liu, Chen Li, Shengyu Wang, Dunyou Wang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/GE9JL9NHRgM/acs.jpcb.7b09965</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>320</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b09965/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-09965s_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965</href></item></canonical><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b09965/20180320/images/medium/jp-2017-09965s_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b09965&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;While silent brain infarcts (SBIs) in screened cohorts are associated with risk of symptomatic stroke and dementia, the clinical significance of incidentally discovered SBIs (id-SBIs) is unknown. Detection may offer an opportunity to initiate prevention measures, but uncertainties about id-SBIs may impede clinicians from addressing them and complicate further study of this condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;This study used semi-structured interviews of practicing clinicians. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. A constant comparative method was used to organize emergent themes and examine new themes. Purposeful sampling was employed to achieve participant diversity. Fifteen clinicians were interviewed. Emergent themes centered on uncertainty about id-SBIs, clinical decision making in response to uncertainty, and evidence needed to resolve uncertainty. All clinicians reported uncertainty about id-SBIs: diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic. Differential responses to uncertainties resulted in practice variation within and between specialties. Diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty discouraged disclosure of imaging findings to patients. Vascular neurologists viewed the prognostic significance of id-SBIs as similar to symptomatic stroke. Therapeutic uncertainty was common, but most participants endorsed using stroke secondary prevention strategies. Regarding future research, all internists indicated they would consider changing practices in response to observational studies, whereas half of the neurologists expressed reluctance to modify practices based on non-randomized data. Several expressed concerns about clinical trial feasibility and lack of equipoise.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;id-SBIs are a focus of uncertainty for clinicians, leading to practice variation.

Together, our studies provide a mechanism for how IDE selectively degrades amyloidogenic peptides and offers structural insights for developing IDE-based therapies.</content></summary><title>Ensemble cryoEM elucidates the mechanism of insulin capture and degradation by human insulin degrading enzyme</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>238</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00021/20180404/images/medium/ct-2018-00021t_0004.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00021</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/RmsJ1zNG4_4/acs.jctc.8b00021</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522814400000</published><author><name>Elisa Rebolini, Gustav Baardsen, Audun Skau Hansen, Karl R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks have occurred in some countries despite supplementary immunization activities (SIA) using measles-containing vaccine with high vaccination coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey to estimate population immunity in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic where repeated mass immunization has failed to eliminate measles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In this nationwide multistage cluster sampling survey conducted in 2014 based on probability proportionate to size sampling, blood samples were collected from 2,135 children and adults living in 52 randomly selected villages. Anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG were measured, and IgG prevalence was calculated. We applied mathematical modelling to estimate the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in 2013 that were averted by the 2011 SIA. A stability testing was applied to the MR vaccine at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C to examine stability differences between measles and rubella vaccine components. Measles IgG prevalence was significantly lower in the target age groups (5–21 years) of the 2011 SIA using a combination vaccine for measles and rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) than in young adults (22–39 years) (86.8% [95% CI: 83.0–90.6] vs. 99.0% [98.3–99.8]; p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas rubella IgG prevalence was significantly higher (88.2% [84.5–91.8] vs. 74.6% [70.7–78.5]; p&amp;lt;0.001). In the SIA target age groups, prevalence of measles IgG, but not rubella IgG, increased with age. CRS cases prevented in 2013 ranged from 16 [0–50] to 92 [32–180] if the force of infection had remained unchanged or had been reduced by 75%, respectively. In freeze-dried conditions, the measles vaccine component was more heat sensitive than the rubella component.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent IgG prevalence between measles and rubella in Lao PDR can be partly explained by different stability of the measles and rubella vaccine components under heat exposure. Suboptimal vaccine handling may cause insufficient immunogenicity for measles, which subsequently leads to an outbreak despite high SIA coverage, while direct evidence is lacking. Temperature monitoring of the vaccine should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Masahiko Hachiya</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194931</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>d0bb5f0f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masahiko Hachiya, Shinsuke Miyano, Yoshio Mori, Emilia Vynnycky, Phath Keungsaneth, Phengta Vongphrachanh, Anonh Xeuatvongsa, Thongchanh Sisouk, Vilasak Som-Oulay, Bouaphan Khamphaphongphane, Bounthanom Sengkeopaseuth, Chansay Pathammavong, Kongxay Phounphenghak, Tomomi Kitamura, Makoto Takeda, Katsuhiro Komase&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;As genomic research gathers momentum in sub-Saharan Africa, it has become increasingly important to understand the reasons why individuals wish to participate in this kind of medical research. Against the background of communitarianism conceived as typical of African communities, it is often suggested that individuals consent to participate on the grounds of solidarity and to further the common good. In this paper, we seek to explore this contention by presenting data from focus groups with potential research participants about what would influence their decisions to participate in genomic research.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;These focus groups were conducted as part of a larger qualitative study with a purposively selected group of participants from a community situated in south west Nigeria. We conducted fifteen focus group sessions comprising 50 participants organized by age and sex, namely: 1) adult (&gt;30 years) males, 2) adult females, 3) youth (18–30 years) males, and 4) youth females. A mixed age-group was conducted to probe different views between the age groups. There was discordance and clear division between the adults and youths regarding the decision to participate in genomic research based on commitment to communal values. Adults based their decision to participate on altruism and furthering the common good while youths based their decisions on personal benefits and preferences and also took into account the views and welfare of family members and neighbours.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This discordance suggests a ‘generational shift’ and we advance a model of ‘relative solidarity’ among the youths, which is different from the communal solidarity model typical of African communitarianism. Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Olubunmi Ogunrin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195171</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f45ff:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>8cb246f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olubunmi Ogunrin, Kerry Woolfall, Mark Gabbay, Lucy Frith&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings suggest the need for a closer look at strategies for implementation of community engagement and informed consent in genomic research in this region, and we recommend further studies to explore this emerging trend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Relative solidarity: Conceptualising communal participation in genomic research among potential research participants in a developing Sub-Saharan African setting</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</content></content><published>1523430000000</published><author><name>Esther Landhuis</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>25</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b3f687a2:435f40:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523437701026</crawled><fingerprint>a35630b1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outsourcing is in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing is in, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;As big pharma downsizes, contract research organizations are reaping the benefits.</description><engagementRate>0.09</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04163-8/d41586-018-04163-8_15592930.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Outsourcing is in</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;
Damaged cartilage has very low regenerative potential which has led to the search for novel tissue-engineering approaches to help treat cartilage defects. While various approaches have been reported, there is no perfect treatment currently. In this study we evaluated the effects of a plant extract, chlorogenic acid (CGA), as part of chondrocyte transplantation on a model of knee joint injury in chicks. First, primary cultured chondrocytes used to evaluate the effects of CGA on chondrogenesis. Then using an articular cartilage injury model of chick knee we assessed the functional recovery after transplantation of the complexes containing chondrocytes and CGA in an alginate scaffold. Histological analysis, PCR, and western blot were further used to understand the underlying mechanisms. We showed that 60 μM CGA in alginate exhibited notable effects on stimulating chondrogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Secondly, it was shown that the application of these complexes accelerated the recovery of injury-induced dysfunction by gait analysis when followed for 21 days. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that there was less abnormal vasculature formation, more chondrocyte proliferation and cartilage matrix synthesis in the presence of the complexes containing CGA. We discovered CGA treated transplantation up-regulated the expressions of Sox9 and Col2a1 which were responsible for the stimulation of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, the application of these complexes could suppress the abnormal angiogenesis and fibrosis at the injury site. Lastly, the elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, p-p65, and MMPs expression were decreased in the presence of CGA. This may be caused through adjusting cellular redox homeostasis associated with Nrf2. This study suggests that combining chondrocytes and CGA on an alginate scaffold can improve the recovery of damaged articular cartilage.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Xin Cheng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195326</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>fc2b41b5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xin Cheng, Ke Li, Shengsong Xu, Peizhi Li, Yu Yan, Guang Wang, Zachary Berman, Rui Guo, Jianxin Liang, Sira Traore, Xuesong Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that &lt;i&gt;Tlr4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (&lt;i&gt;Tlr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt;). With one exception, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt; showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Peter Moritz Becher</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193844</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9f9:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>84d51f53</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Moritz Becher, Svenja Hinrichs, Nina Fluschnik, Jan K.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Zhaoqing Du</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4612:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Lian Leng Low</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4604:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>dfc2be54</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

The mimetic juveniles of a number of carangid fish species resemble plant parts floating near the water surface, such as leaves, seeds and other plant debris. The present study is the first to verify the morphological similarities and ecomorphological relationships between three carangids (&lt;i&gt;Oligoplites saurus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Oligoplites palometa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trachinotus falcatus&lt;/i&gt;) and their associated plant models. Behavioral observations were conducted in the estuary of Curuçá River, in northeastern Pará (Brazil) between August 2015 and July 2016. Individual fishes and associated floating objects (models) were sampled for comparative analysis using both geometric and morphometric approaches. While the mimetic fish and their models retain their own distinct, intrinsic morphological features, a high degree of morphological similarity was found between each fish species and its model. The morphometric analyses revealed a general tendency of isometric development in all three fish species, probably related to their pelagic habitats, during all ontogenetic stages.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Alexya Cunha de Queiroz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194437</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37a8:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>14d8416f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexya Cunha de Queiroz, Marcelo Vallinoto, Yoichi Sakai, Tommaso Giarrizzo, Breno Barros&lt;/p&gt;

The morphometric analyses revealed a general tendency of isometric development in all three fish species, probably related to their pelagic habitats, during all ontogenetic stages.</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>Scaling mimesis: Morphometric and ecomorphological similarities in three sympatric plant-mimetic fish of the family Carangidae (Teleostei)</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03528-x</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03528-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/k72yCWF1zkw/s41467-018-03528-x</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Explosive dissolution and trapping of block copolymer seed crystallites&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explosive dissolution and trapping of block copolymer seed crystallites, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03528-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03528-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The study of the dissolution of polymer crystals is a challenging task.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Hanna Gertz</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195396</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57601:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species, which is one of the main animal feed contaminants causing reproductive disorders in livestock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic characteristics and ZEN removal ability of a &lt;i&gt;Bacillus licheniformis&lt;/i&gt; strain CK1. The probiotic properties, including acidic tolerance, bile salt tolerance, adherence capability, and anti-pathogenic activities of CK1 were evaluated. CK1 survived after incubation at pH 2.0 or 3.0 for 3 h, grew well in LB broth containing 0.3% oxgall, possessed adherence capability to Caco-2 cells, and inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 and &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The ZEN removal ability of CK1 was compared with a mineral mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), and a well-characterized biological mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG (LGG). At 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 5 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of ZEN, the ZEN removal percentage of CK1 was 73.0%, which was significantly higher than that of HSCAS and LGG (45.9% and 48.4%, respectively). In the pH range of 2.5–8.0, CK1 removed up to 65% of ZEN. At temperatures between 4 and 42°C, CK1 removed more than 75% of ZEN. In the adsorption stability analysis, the amounts of ZEN removed by CK1 was over 30% even after five consecutive rounds of washing procedures. These findings demonstrated that CK1 displayed probiotic characteristics and removed ZEN effectively. Therefore, CK1 has a great potential for the development of feed additive to remove ZEN.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Tsui-Chun Hsu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194866</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>fdd5bec1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsui-Chun Hsu, Ping-Jung Yi, Ting-Yu Lee, Je-Ruei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Plant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) vary in sequence structure. We assembled the &lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; mtDNA using a mean coverage depth of 25X whole genome sequencing (WGS) and confirmed the presence of eight contigs/fragments by BLASTZ using the previously reported KJ820683 and AP012988 mtDNA as reference. Assembly of the mtDNA sequence reads resulted in a circular structure of 219,975 bp. Our assembled mtDNA, NCBI acc. no. KU831325, contained 34 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA genes, and 19 tRNA genes with similarity to the KJ820683 and AP012988 reference mtDNA. No large repeats were found in the KU831325 assembly. However, KU831325 showed differences in the arrangement of bases at different regions compared to the previously reported mtDNAs. In the reference mtDNAs KJ820683 and AP012988, contig/fragment number 4 is partitioned into two contigs/fragments, 4a and 4b. However, contig/fragment number 4 was a single contig/fragment with 29,661 bp in KU831325. PCR and qRT-PCR using flanking markers from separate parts of contig/fragment number 4 confirmed it to be a single contig/fragment. In addition, genome re-alignment of the plastid genome and mtDNAs supported the presence of heteroplasmy and reverse arrangement of the heteroplasmic blocks within the other mtDNAs compared to KU831325 that might be one of the causal factors for its diversity. Our results thus confirm the existence of different mtDNAs in diverse &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oleracea&lt;/i&gt; subspecies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Kiwoung Yang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194356</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>fb3602a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiwoung Yang, Ujjal Kumar Nath, Manosh Kumar Biswas, Md Abdul Kayum, Go-eun Yi, Jonghoon Lee, Tae-Jin Yang, Ill-Sup Nou&lt;/p&gt;

In the physiochemical sciences, plasma is used to describe an ionized gas. Previous studies have implicated plasma surface treatment in the enhancement of hydrophilicity of implanted musculoskeletal reconstructive materials. Hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics, widely used in bone tissue regeneration, have made great advancements to skeletal surgery. In the present study, we investigate the impact of low-pressure plasma on the interconnected porous calcium hydroxyapatite (IP-CHA) both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our results indicate that dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, when used with oxygen, can augment the hydrophilicity of non-porous HA surfaces and the osteoconductivity of the IP-CHA disc via increased water penetration of inner porous structures, as demonstrated through microfocus computed tomography (μCT) assay. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; implantation of plasma-treated IP-CHA displayed superior bone ingrowth than untreated IP-CHA. Though plasma-treated IP-CHA did not alter osteoblast cell proliferation, it accelerated osteogenic differentiation of seeded marrow mesenchymal stem cells. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that this plasma treatment increases levels of oxygen, rather than nitrogen, on the plasma-treated IP-CHA surface. These findings suggest that plasma treatment, an easy and simple processing, can significantly improve the osteoconductive potential of commonly used artificial bones such as IP-CHA. Further optimization of plasma treatment and longer-term follow-up of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; application are required toward its clinical application.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Yu Moriguchi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194303</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e339c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><fingerprint>54290903</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Moriguchi, Dae-Sung Lee, Ryota Chijimatsu, Khair Thamina, Kazuto Masuda, Dai Itsuki, Hideki Yoshikawa, Satoshi Hamaguchi, Akira Myoui&lt;/p&gt;

Further optimization of plasma treatment and longer-term follow-up of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; application are required toward its clinical application.</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Impact of non-thermal plasma surface modification on porous calcium hydroxyapatite ceramics for bone regeneration</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215723v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Accurately clustering cell types from a mass of heterogeneous cells is a crucial first step for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194963</canonicalUrl><engagement>13</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef11:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>394e370c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway.

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD).

Objective &lt;p&gt;To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine during short-term treatment in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials databases for randomized controlled trials(RCTs) comparing duloxetine or duloxetine plus other antipsychotics with placebo for the treatment of GAD in adults. Outcome measures were (1) efficacy, assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS) anxiety subscale score, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety(HAM-A) psychic and somatic anxiety factor scores, and response and remission rates based on total scores of HAM-A; (2) tolerability, assessed by discontinuation rate due to adverse events, the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events(TEAEs) and serious adverse events(SAEs). Review Manager 5.3 and Stata Version 12.0 software were used for all statistical analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis included 8 RCTs. Mean changes in the HADS anxiety subscale score [mean difference(MD) = 2.32, 95% confidence interval(CI) 1.77–2.88, P&amp;lt;0.00001] and HAM-A psychic anxiety factor score were significantly greater in patients with GAD that received duloxetine compared to those that received placebo (MD = 2.15, 95%CI 1.61–2.68, P&amp;lt;0.00001). However, there was no difference in mean change in the HAM-A somatic anxiety factor score (MD = 1.13, 95%CI 0.67–1.58, P&amp;lt;0.00001).

Tools currently available for TAD identification are sensitive to experimental conditions such as coverage, resolution and noise level. Results: Here, we present RobusTAD, a tool to score TAD boundaries in a manner that is robust to these parameters.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negatively biased interpretations play an important role in anxiety and depression, which are highly prevalent in adolescence, and changing such biases might thus reduce or prevent emotional disorders. We investigated the short- and long-term effects of an online interpretation bias modification training in unselected adolescents to explore its potential in preventing anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants (N = 173) were randomly allocated to eight online sessions of interpretation or placebo training. Interpretation bias was assessed pre- and post-training. Primary outcomes of anxiety and depression, and secondary measures of emotional resilience were assessed pre- and post-training and at three, six, and twelve months follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to placebo, interpretation training marginally increased positive interpretations. Irrespective of training condition, symptoms of anxiety and depression showed a decline post-training and at follow-up, and indices of resilience showed an increase. Change in interpretation bias, baseline interpretation bias, stressful life events, or number of training sessions completed did not moderate the effects on anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results suggest that interpretation training as implemented in this study has no added value in reducing symptoms or enhancing resilience in unselected adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Leone de Voogd</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194274</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e12:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>4a5b76f2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leone de Voogd, Reinout W.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is considered a major worldwide health burden, with high mortality and associated costs. Health indicators are essential to define strategies to improve the treatment of diseases, and the epidemiology information of sepsis in developing countries is scarce. Thus, the aim of this work is to assess trends in the incidence, lethality, costs, and other indicators of sepsis for Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS—&lt;i&gt;Sistema Único de Saúde&lt;/i&gt;) hospitalizations for the period from January 2006 to December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted this study using data from the SUS hospital information system. We selected registries of SUS hospitalizations of patients diagnosed with sepsis (total of 724,458 cases from 4,271 public and private Brazilian hospitals).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2015, the annual sepsis incidence increased 50.5% from 31.5/100,000 to 47.4/100,000 persons. The mean hospital length of stay (LOS) was 9.0 days. A total of 29.1% of the hospitalizations had admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a mean ICU LOS of 8.0 days. The mean cost per hospitalization was US$624.0 and for hospitalizations requiring intensive care was U$1,708.1. The overall sepsis lethality rate was 46.3%, and for hospitalizations with admission to the ICU, it was 64.5%. During the study period, the lethality rate for children/teenagers decreased 40.1%, but for all other age groups it increased 11.4%. The sepsis lethality rate in public hospitals (55.5%) was higher than private hospitals (37.0%) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mean hospitalization LOS for public hospitals (10.3 days) was higher than private hospitals (7.6 days) (p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incidence and lethality rate of sepsis increased in SUS hospitalizations during the study period. The SUS’s low reimbursement to hospitals for treating sepsis may be one of the reasons for the high lethality rate.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Ricardo Alfredo Quintano Neira</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793634:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>1add40aa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ricardo Alfredo Quintano Neira, Silvio Hamacher, André Miguel Japiassú&lt;/p&gt;

The flow field past a prosthetic aortic valve comprises many details that indicate whether the prosthesis is functioning well or not. It is, however, not yet fully understood how an optimal flow scenario would look, i.e. which subtleties of the fluid dynamics in place are essential regarding the durability and compatibility of a prosthetic valve. In this study, we measured and analyzed the 3D flow field in the vicinity of a bio-prosthetic heart valve in function of the aortic root size. The measurements were conducted within aortic root phantoms of different size, mounted in a custom-built hydraulic setup, which mimicked physiological flow conditions in the aorta. Tomographic particle image velocimetry was used to measure the 3D instantaneous velocity field at various instances. Several 3D fields (e.g. instantaneous and mean velocity, 3D shear rate) were analyzed and compared focusing on the impact of the aortic root size, but also in order to gain general insight in the 3D flow structure past the bio-prosthetic valve. We found that the diameter of the aortic jet relative to the diameter of the ascending aorta is the most important parameter in determining the characteristics of the flow. A large aortic cross-section, relative to the cross-section of the aortic jet, was associated with higher levels of turbulence intensity and higher retrograde flow in the ascending aorta.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>David Hasler</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194384</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e7:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>4343ac6e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Hasler, Dominik Obrist&lt;/p&gt;

Echinoderms are capable of asexual reproduction by fission. An individual divides into parts due to changes in the strength of connective tissue of the body wall. The structure of connective tissue and the mechanisms of variations in its strength in echinoderms remain poorly studied. An analysis of transcriptomes of individuals during the process of fission provides a new opportunity to understand the mechanisms of connective tissue mutability. In the holothurian &lt;i&gt;Cladolabes schmeltzii&lt;/i&gt;, we have found a rather complex organization of connective tissue. Transcripts of genes encoding a wide range of structural proteins of extracellular matrix, as well as various proteases and their inhibitors, have been discovered. All these molecules may constitute a part of the mechanism of connective tissue mutability. According to our data, the extracellular matrix of echinoderms is substantially distinguished from that of vertebrates by the lack of elastin, fibronectins, and tenascins. In case of fission, a large number of genes of transcription factors and components of different signaling pathways are expressed. Products of these genes are probably involved in regulation of asexual reproduction, connective tissue mutability, and preparation of tissues for subsequent regeneration. It has been shown that holothurian tensilins are a special group of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, which has formed within the class Holothuroidea and is absent from other echinoderms. Our data can serve a basis for the further study of the mechanisms of extracellular matrix mutability, as well as the mechanisms responsible for asexual reproduction in echinoderms.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Igor Yu.

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006054</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16278056b21:115fb02:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522432043809</crawled><fingerprint>a4e34836</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to gain insight into the physiological changes occurring in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) after autogenic drainage (AD). Changes in respiratory system resistance (Rrs), reactance (Xrs), and spirometry were analyzed in adult CF subjects after a single AD physiotherapy session.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective observational study was conducted during the annual check-up of adult CF subjects in stable condition. Spirometry and Rrs and Xrs measurements using the forced oscillations technique at 5, 11, and 19 hertz (Hz) were performed before and 30 min after a 20-min AD session. Control CF subjects were tested at baseline and 50 min without AD.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to gain insight into the physiological changes occurring in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) after autogenic drainage (AD). Changes in respiratory system resistance (Rrs), reactance (Xrs), and spirometry were analyzed in adult CF subjects after a single AD physiotherapy session.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective observational study was conducted during the annual check-up of adult CF subjects in stable condition. Spirometry and Rrs and Xrs measurements using the forced oscillations technique at 5, 11, and 19 hertz (Hz) were performed before and 30 min after a 20-min AD session. Control CF subjects were tested at baseline and 50 min without AD. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median [interquartile range].&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty subjects were included in the physiotherapy group (age 29 [25–34] years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 40.3 [30.1–57.9]% predicted) and 11 in the control group (age 31 [28.5–36.5] years, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 43.6 [31.1–51.9] % predicted). No significant changes in any parameter were observed in the control group. AD modestly but significantly increased the forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005897</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005897</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d7:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521827316353</crawled><fingerprint>f5bab2e6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Solernou, Benjamin S.

A widespread opinion is that conservation efforts disproportionately benefit charismatic species. However, this doesn’t mean that they are not threatened, and which species are “charismatic” remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animals’ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Nro8ydzQjr8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997</href></item></canonical><engagement>65</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003997</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2ae:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523555694285</crawled><fingerprint>d602cb88</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>6.5</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Courchamp, Ivan Jaric, Céline Albert, Yves Meinard, William J.

The sodium-independent cystine-glutamate antiporter plays an important role in extracellular cystine uptake. It comprises the transmembrane protein, xCT and its chaperone, CD98. Because glutathione is only weakly cell membrane permeable, cellular uptake of its precursor, cystine, is known to be a key step in glutathione synthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that xCT expression affects the progression of tumors and their resistance to therapy. Sulfasalazine is an inhibitor of xCT that is known to increase cellular oxidative stress, giving it anti-tumor potential. Here, we describe a radio-sensitizing effect of sulfasalazine using a B16F10 melanoma model. Sulfasalazine decreased glutathione concentrations and resistance to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in B16F10 melanoma cells, but not in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. It synergistically enhanced the cyto-killing effect of X-irradiation in B16F10 cells. It inhibited cellular DNA damage repair and prolonged cell cycle arrest after X-irradiation. Furthermore, in an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; transplanted melanoma model, sulfasalazine decreased intratumoral glutathione content, leading to enhanced susceptibility to radiation therapy.

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001959</href></item></canonical><engagement>309</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2001959</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1624482964b:1c8565b:76251cdd</id><crawled>1521567831627</crawled><fingerprint>beb3cc5a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Jessica L.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E almost exclusively occurs in African people, and its presence is more commonly associated with the development of chronic HBV (CHB) infection. Moreover, an epidemiological link has been found between the distribution of HBV genotype E infection and African countries with high incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma. As part of a programme for the health assessment of migrants, we evaluated 358 young African subjects for HBV infection; 58.1% (208/358) were positive for an HBV marker, and 54 (25.5%) had CHB. Eighty-one percent of the CHB subjects were infected with HBV genotype E, with a median serum HBV-DNA of 3.2 (IQR: 2.7–3.6) logIU/ml. All patients had high serum HBsAg titres (10,899 [range 5,359–20,272] IU/ml), and no correlation was found between HBsAg titres and HBV-DNA plasma levels. RT sequence analysis showed the presence of a number of immune escape mutations: strains from all of the patients had a serine at HBsAg position 140; 3 also had T116N, Y100C, and P142L+S143L substitutions; and 1 had a G112R substitution. Six (18%) patients had stop-codons at position 216. In 5 of the 9 (26.5%) CHB patients, ultrasound liver biopsy, quantification of total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA, and RT/HBsAg sequencing were performed. The median (IQR) total intrahepatic HBV-DNA was 766 (753–1139) copies/1000 cells, and the median (IQR) cccDNA was 17 (10–27) copies/1000 cells. Correlations were observed for both total intrahepatic HBV-DNA and cccDNA with serum HBV-DNA, while no correlation was found for the HBsAg titres. A difference of 2.5/1,000 nucleotides was found in the HBsAg sequences obtained from plasma and from liver tissue, with 3 cases of possible viral anatomical compartmentalization. In conclusion, a high rate of CHB infection due to the E genotype was demonstrated in a group of immigrants from Western Africa. An analysis of the viral strains obtained showed the virological characteristics of immune escape, which may be the cause of viral replication persistence. Moreover, a fair percentage of stop codon mutations were found. The lack of correlation between HBsAg titres and plasma or intrahepatic HBV-DNA found in these subjects suggests a pathway of virus production that is not linked to HBsAg secretion. Studies with a larger number of patients with CHB due to the E genotype are advisable to corroborate these observations.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Vincenzo Malagnino</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195045</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1e:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>65b3ef36</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vincenzo Malagnino, Romina Salpini, Gaetano Maffongelli, Arianna Battisti, Lavinia Fabeni, Lorenzo Piermatteo, Luna Colagrossi, Vanessa Fini, Alessandra Ricciardi, Cesare Sarrecchia, Carlo Federico Perno, Massimo Andreoni, Valentina Svicher, Loredana Sarmati&lt;/p&gt;

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81).

In the present study, we have evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of repeated brain metastases (BM) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS2) following local failure of a prior radiosurgical procedure (SRS1). Between December 1996 and August 2015, 30 patients with 36 BM underwent SRS2 with a median dose of 18Gy. All BM were located outside critical structures. Following SRS2, local control at 6 months and one year were respectively 82.9% (IC 95%: 67.6–91.9) and 67.8% (IC 95%: 51–81). On multivariate analysis, planning target volume (PTV) &amp;lt; 3cc (HR: 0.19 (0.1–0.52)) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) prior to SRS2 (HR: 0.25 (0.1–0.64)) were significantly associated with a better local control. One- and two-year overall survival rates after SRS2 were respectively 65.5% (IC 95%: 47.3–80%) and 27.6% (IC 95%: 14.7–45.7). Median overall survival following SRS2 was 14.2 months (range 1–106). Nineteen (63%) patients died from progressive systemic disease. Three (10%) patients died from out-field progressive brain disease and 8 (27%) in-field. Concerning toxicities, edema, radionecrosis, and hemorrhages were identified in 5 (12.8%), 4 (10.2%), and 5 (12.8%) patients respectively. No toxicity resulted in a neurological deficit. On univariate analysis, toxicities were significantly associated with PTV &gt; 7cc (p = 0.02) and all patients had a WBRT before SRS2. A second course of SRS for locally recurrent brain metastases showed encouraging rates of local control. This treatment led to acceptable toxicities, especially for brain metastases smaller than 7cc, in our selected cohort of patients with BM located outside critical structures. Further studies are needed.</description><published>1522962000000</published><title>Second course of stereotactic radiosurgery for locally recurrent brain metastases: Safety and efficacy</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195596</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195596</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195596</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kritsada Pruksaphon, Akarin Intaramat, Kavi Ratanabanangkoon, Joshua D.

&lt;i&gt;Talaromyces&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; is a thermally dimorphic fungus that can cause opportunistic systemic mycoses in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It has also been reported among patients with other causes of immunodeficiency, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, cancer, organ transplanted patients receiving immunosuppressive drug and adult onset immunodeficiency syndromes. Recent studies indicate that the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and treatment strategies of talaromycosis (penicilliosis) marneffei are different between patients with and without HIV infection. Therefore early and accurate diagnosis of talaromycosis marneffei is crucial to the proper management and treatment. Since current diagnostic methods are currently inadequate, the aim of this study was to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) for the detection of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; yeast antigens in urine samples. The highly &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei-&lt;/i&gt;specific monoclonal antibody 4D1 (MAb 4D1) conjugated with gold colloid at pH 6.5 was used as signal generator. The nitrocellulose membrane was lined with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; cytoplasmic yeast antigen (TM CYA) to serve as the test line, and rabbit anti-mouse IgG was the control line. Subjecting the assembled test strip to urine samples containing &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; antigen produced a visible result within 20 minutes. The sensitivity limit of the assay was 3.125μg/ml of TM CYA. The ICT was used to test urine samples from 66 patients with blood culture confirmed talaromycosis marneffei, 42 patients with other fungal or bacterial infections, and 70 normal healthy individuals from endemic area of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt;. The test exhibited sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 87.87%, 100% and 95.5%, respectively.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess the cost-effectiveness of the elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR) regimen in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;This study uses a health economic model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating previously untreated and treatment experienced chronic hepatitis C patients who have severe and end stage renal disease with the elbasvir-grazoprevir regimen versus no treatment in the French context. The lifetime homogeneous markovian model comprises of forty combined health states including hepatitis C virus and chronic kidney disease. The model parameters were from a multicentre randomized controlled trial, ANRS CO22 HEPATHER French cohort and literature. 1000 Monte Carlo simulations of patient health states for each treatment strategy are used for probabilistic sensitivity analysis and 95% confidence intervals calculations. The results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients in the HEPATHER French cohort was 59.6 years and 56% of them were men. 22.3% of patients had a F0 fibrosis stage (no fibrosis), 24.1% a F1 stage (portal fibrosis without septa), 7.1% a F2 stage (portal fibrosis with few septa), 21.4% a F3 stage (numerous septa without fibrosis) and 25% a F4 fibrosis stage (compensated cirrhosis). Among these HCV genotype 1 patients, 30% had severe renal impairment stage 4, 33% had a severe renal insufficiency stage 5 and 37% had terminal severe renal impairment stage 5 treated by dialysis.&lt;/p&gt; Intervention &lt;p&gt;Fixed-dose combination of direct-acting antiviral agents elbasvir and grazoprevir compared to no-treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;EBR/GZR increased the number of life years (6.3 years) compared to no treatment (5.1 years) on a lifetime horizon. The total number of QALYs was higher for the new treatment because of better utility on health conditions (6.2 versus 3.7 QALYs). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was of €15,212 per QALY gained for the base case analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This cost-utility model is an innovative approach that simultaneously looks at the disease evolution of chronic hepatitis C and chronic kidney disease. EBR/GZR without interferon and ribavirin, produced the greatest benefit in terms of life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in treatment-naïve or experienced patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and stage 4–5 chronic kidney disease including dialysis patients. Based on shape of the acceptability curve, EBR/GZR can be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of €20,000 /QALY for patients with renal insufficiency with severe and end-stage renal disease compared to no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Franck Maunoury</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194329</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e16:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>71ffc9b3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franck Maunoury, Aurore Clément, Chizoba Nwankwo, Laurie Levy-Bachelot, Armand Abergel, Vincent Di Martino, Eric Thervet, Isabelle Durand-Zaleski&lt;/p&gt;

Our results suggest that the persistent polarization underlying many cellular and developmental processes could arise through a simple biophysical process, without any additional requirement for biochemical positive and negative feedback loops.</description><published>1521270000000</published><title>Protein phase separation provides long-term memory of transient spatial stimuli [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196039</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196039</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196039</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Xu, Ning Li, Mingshan Lu, Elijah Dixon, Robert P.

Background &lt;p&gt;While links between disability and poverty are well established, there have been few longitudinal studies to clarify direction of causality, particularly among older adults in low and middle income countries. We aimed to study the effect of care dependence among older adult residents on the economic functioning of their households, in catchment area survey sites in Peru, Mexico and China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Households were classified from the evolution of the needs for care of older residents, over two previous community surveys, as ‘incident care’, ‘chronic care’ or ‘no care’, and followed up three years later to ascertain economic outcomes (household income, consumption, economic strain, satisfaction with economic circumstances, healthcare expenditure and residents giving up work or education to care).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Household income did not differ between household groups. However, income from paid work (Pooled Count Ratio pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–1.00) and government transfers (pCR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69–0.93) were lower in care households. Consumption was 12% lower in chronic care households (pCR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–0.99). Household healthcare expenditure was higher (pCR 1.55, 95% CI 1.26–1.90), and catastrophic healthcare spending more common (pRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.64–2.22) in care households.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While endogeneity cannot be confidently excluded as an explanation for the findings, this study indicates that older people’s needs for care have a discernable impact on household economics, controlling for baseline indicators of long-term economic status. Although living, typically, in multigenerational family units, older people have not featured prominently in global health and development agendas. Population ageing will rapidly increase the number of households where older people live, and their societal significance. Building sustainable long-term care systems for the future will require some combination of improved income security in old age; incentivisation of informal care through compensation for direct and opportunity costs; and development of community care services to support, and, where necessary, supplement or substitute the central role of informal caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Maëlenn M.

The reported narrow genetic base of cultivated potato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum tuberosum&lt;/i&gt;) can be expanded by the introgression of many related species with large genetic diversity. The analysis of the genetic structure of a potato population is important to broaden the genetic base of breeding programs by the identification of different genetic pools. A panel composed by 231 diverse genotypes was characterized using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of the Illumina Infinium Potato SNP Array V2 to identify population structure and assess genetic diversity using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and pedigree analysis.

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Ameeta S.

Background &lt;p&gt;In Kazakhstan, scarce official prevalence data exists for mood disorders. This study investigates the occurrence of depressive symptoms among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and the relationship between depressive symptoms, HIV treatment initiation and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients seen at the Almaty AIDS Center between April and December 2013. Two data sources were used: 1) self-administered survey that included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to capture depression symptoms and 2) medical record review. Two primary outcomes were evaluated with log-binomial models and Fisher’s exact test: the relationship between depression symptoms and 1) HIV treatment group, and 2) HIV adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 564 participants, 9.9% reported symptoms consistent with a depressive disorder. None had received treatment for depression. Among those not on ART, a relationship between depressive symptoms and low CD4 counts (≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident (7.1% for CD4 ≤ 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 0.9% for CD4 &gt; 350 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.029). In multivariable analysis, a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms was statistically associated with ART treatment, positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status, and being unmarried. For those taking ART, treatment adherence was not statistically associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms (12.5% vs 20.0%, p = 0.176); limited power may have impacted statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Untreated depression was found among PLWHA suggesting the need to evaluate access to psychiatric treatment.

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels control electrical rhythmicity in specialized brain and heart cells. We quantitatively analysed voltage-dependent activation of homotetrameric HCN2 channels and its modulation by the second messenger cAMP using global fits of hidden Markovian models to complex experimental data. We show that voltage-dependent activation is essentially governed by two separable voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: It stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP. Together, these results provide detailed new insight into the voltage- and cAMP-induced activation gating of HCN channels.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/syBDlU90QXo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006045</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006045</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1624ed0b0a5:56ecc:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521740722341</crawled><fingerprint>9c9a9e5c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sabine Hummert, Susanne Thon, Thomas Eick, Ralf Schmauder, Eckhard Schulz, Klaus Benndorf&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10. SH-4-54 treatment drastically reduced the viability of the stem-like line GBAM1 in liquid culture, but its effect lessened in presence of a 3D ECM and stromal cells. Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>R.

Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sensitive inflammatory marker rapidly increased in response to infection, injury or trauma during the acute phase. Resolution of the acute phase and SAA reduction are well documented, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Two inducible SAA proteins, SAA1 and SAA2, with their variants could contribute to systemic inflammation. While unconjugated human variant SAA1α is already commercially available, the variants of SAA2 are not. Antibodies against SAA have been identified in apparently healthy blood donors (HBDs) in smaller, preliminary studies. So, our objective was to detect anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in the sera of 300 HBDs using ELISA, characterize their specificity and avidity. Additionally, we aimed to determine the presence of anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α autoantibodies in intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparations and examine their effects on released IL-6 from SAA/SAA1α-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Autoantibodies against SAA and SAA1α had a median (IQR) absorbance OD (A&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.655 (0.262–1.293) and 0.493 (0.284–0.713), respectively. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α exhibited heterogeneous to high avidity and reached peak levels between 41–50 years, then diminished with age in the oldest group (51–67 years). Women consistently exhibited significantly higher levels than men. Good positive correlation was observed between anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α. Both anti-SAA and anti-SAA1α were detected in IVIg, their fractions subsequently isolated, and shown to decrease IL-6 protein levels released from SAA/SAA1α-treated PBMCs. In conclusion, naturally occurring antibodies against SAA and anti-SAA1α could play a physiological role in down-regulating their antigen and proinflammatory cytokines leading to the resolution of the acute phase and could be an important therapeutic option in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Tadeja Kuret</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195346</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fc:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>bbb665c1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tadeja Kuret, Katja Lakota, Polonca Mali, Saša Čučnik, Sonja Praprotnik, Matija Tomšič, Snezna Sodin-Semrl&lt;/p&gt;

Further, we are able to use both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data to independently validate millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.</description><published>1523516400000</published><title>Haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020978?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020978?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020978?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521513198000</published><author><name>Iris Theophilou</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b89:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><fingerprint>4eeca5b6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Structure of the first order reduced density matrix in three electron systems: A generalized Pauli constraints assisted study</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25191?af=R</originId><published>1522116730699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25191?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25191?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162653a1f4b:6cdf6:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522116730699</crawled><fingerprint>6bbc184d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaar1916?rss=1</originId><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaar1916?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaar1916?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapy can confer durable benefit, but the percentage of patients who respond to this approach remains modest.

The immune state of wild animals is largely unknown. Knowing this and what affects it is important in understanding how infection and disease affects wild animals. The immune state of wild animals is also important in understanding the biology of their pathogens, which is directly relevant to explaining pathogen spillover among species, including to humans. The paucity of knowledge about wild animals&apos; immune state is in stark contrast to our exquisitely detailed understanding of the immunobiology of laboratory animals. Making an immune response is costly, and many factors (such as age, sex, infection status, and body condition) have individually been shown to constrain or promote immune responses. But, whether or not these factors affect immune responses and immune state in wild animals, their relative importance, and how they interact (or do not) are unknown. Here, we have investigated the immune ecology of wild house mice—the same species as the laboratory mouse—as an example of a wild mammal, characterising their adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular, and innate immune state. Firstly, we show how immune variation is structured among mouse populations, finding that there can be extensive immune discordance among neighbouring populations. Secondly, we identify the principal factors that underlie the immunological differences among mice, showing that body condition promotes and age constrains individuals’ immune state, while factors such as microparasite infection and season are comparatively unimportant. By applying a multifactorial analysis to an immune system-wide analysis, our results bring a new and unified understanding of the immunobiology of a wild mammal.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6q0s1nnNEUE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003538</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48b:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523642710008</crawled><fingerprint>c5b1a7f5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Abolins, Luke Lazarou, Laura Weldon, Louise Hughes, Elizabeth C.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Vijayan Jasna</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194020</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d53:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>85a5d3b8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

It’s from the IBM Zürich group that has pioneered so much work in this area. Over just the time I’ve been writing this blog, that idea has gone from “Maybe someday” to “In some well-defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/09/03/real_molecules&quot;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;” to “A few real-world examples known”, and now perhaps to “Hey, this might actually start working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not just AFM. There’s also scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), among other even more exotic ideas, and together you can get information that simply cannot be obtained by any other methods. Here they are in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFM is done typically by picking up a single CO molecule (from the carbon end) with the tip of the metal probe and scanning with the oxygen end across an adsorbed molecule (at liquid helium temperatures) at a constant height, about 4 Angstroms over the molecule itself. Often you go back and scan at several different tip heights. There are many other possible tips – xenon atoms, other diatomic molecules, halogen atoms, and so on. The cantilever holding the tip is oscillating (over about half an Angstrom) at a high frequency, and changes in this, induced by interactions with the molecule under study, are what get measured out (along with deflections in the angle that the CO molecule makes with the surface).  The mechanism for these changes is just flat-out Pauli repulsion for the most part – electrons not wanting to occupy the same volume of space and getting out of each other’s way – although van der Waals and electrostatic forces can show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPFM is pretty similar, except the readout is the voltage dependence of the position of the tip relative to the molecule, rather than changes in frequency of oscillation. You pick a voltage that gives you good signal/noise and scan around as with AFM. In practice, that gives you more of a pure electrostatic read on the surface, and it’s very useful for determining charge states and electron density in the sample. For example, fluorine is very close to the size of hydrogen, but they look dramatically different in KPFM because of the mass of electrons around the F atoms. Interpretation of the data, though, is not very straightforward, and often seems to involve matching up the experimental results to various calculations to try to see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in STM you apply a voltage to the tip and measure the changes in electric current between the tip and the sample as you scan, often by having the tip height change to keep a constant current level. At these distances, electrons are tunneling right across the gap, so this is sheer quantum mechanics all the way. If you pick the appropriate voltage, electrons can be temporarily attached to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the test molecule (or detached from the highest-occupied, the HOMO, if you flip the voltage around), and the resulting images are absolutely &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; for someone like me who came up thinking of these as mathematical abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of these, with a CO tip used to show the bonds in the graphene-like molecule and then (in STM mode), its LUMO. As you can see, the resolution on these experiments is getting pretty good, and allows for an unequivocal assignment of the structure. Of course, an X-ray structure determination would almost certainly nail that down, too, but for that you have to have a purified sample and a good crystal. One interesting thing about AFM-type techniques is that you can scatter a mixed sample across the surface and take a look at the various things that might be in it, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an illustration of something else that can really only be done under AFM conditions: actual atomic-level manipulation of the sample. Individual atoms can be pushed, twanged, or (as in this case) removed entirely. The result can be highly reactive intermediates (radicals, arynes, etc.) that can be studied directly at the liquid-helium temperatures involved. There are also opportunities to do on-surface reaction by heating followed by cooling down to AFM conditions, through photochemistry, etc. You can also study the interaction of individual molecules with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has to be said that there are not very many labs that are capable of these things at the moment, but that’s changing with the advent of more commercial apparatus and the spread of experienced workers in the field. What’s lacking? As the authors note, there’s a real need for techniques that might be able to read out functional groups and elements more directly. An even bigger challenge is that all the most spectacular results to date have been on planar or near-planar molecules, since these yield the most (and the most interpretable) data. You’re running your quantum fingers over the surface of things here, so the inside of a folded-up conformation is just not going to be available. And finally, there need to be improvements in the time it takes to get a measurement. It’s been stuck at roughly ten-minutes-per-molecule for a long time, but better time resolution would allow for a lot of new things to be picked up (and for better characterization of mixtures, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies.

Deformed wing virus (DWV) is an important pathogen in a broad range of insects, including honey bees. Concordant with the spread of &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt;, DWV is present in the majority of honey bee colonies and can result in either low-level infections with asymptomatic bees that nonetheless exhibit increased colony loss under stress, or high-level infections with acute effects on bee health and viability. DWV can be transmitted vertically or horizontally and evidence suggests that horizontal transmission via &lt;i&gt;Varroa&lt;/i&gt; is associated with acute symptomatic infections. Vertical transmission also occurs and is presumably important for the maintenance of DWV in honey bee populations. To further our understanding the vertical transmission of DWV through queens, we performed three experiments: we studied the quantitative effectiveness of vertical transmission, surveyed the prevalence of successful egg infection under commercial conditions, and distinguished among three possible mechanisms of transmission. We find that queen-infection level predicts the DWV titers in their eggs, although the transmission is not very efficient. Our quantitative assessment of DWV demonstrates that eggs in 1/3 of the colonies are infected with DWV and highly infected eggs are rare in newly-installed spring colonies. Additionally, our results indicate that DWV transmission occurs predominantly by virus adhering to the surface of eggs (transovum) rather than intracellularly. Our combined results suggest that the queens’ DWV vectoring capacity in practice is not as high as its theoretical potential. Thus, DWV transmission by honey bee queens is part of the DWV epidemic with relevant practical implications, which should be further studied.</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Quantitative patterns of vertical transmission of deformed wing virus in honey bees</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194294</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Panteleimon D.

The environmental fates of pharmaceuticals and the effects of crop protection products on non-target species are subjects that are undergoing intense review. Since measuring the concentrations and effects of xenobiotics on all affected species under all conceivable scenarios is not feasible, standard laboratory animals such as rabbits are tested, and the observed adverse effects are translated to focal species for environmental risk assessments. In that respect, mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly important for evaluating the consequences of pesticides in untested scenarios. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK/TK) modelling is a well-established methodology used to predict tissue concentrations based on the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs and toxicants. In the present work, a rabbit PBPK/TK model is developed and evaluated with data available from the literature. The model predictions include scenarios of both intravenous (i.v.) and oral (p.o.) administration of small and large compounds. The presented rabbit PBPK/TK model predicts the pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC) of the tested compounds with an average 1.7-fold error. This result indicates a good predictive capacity of the model, which enables its use for risk assessment modelling and simulations.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Panteleimon D.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Appropriate mechanical ventilation and prevention of alveolar collaps is mainly dependent on transpulmonary pressure TPP. TPP is assessed by measurement of esophageal pressure EP, largely influenced by pleural and intraabdominal pressure IAP. Consecutively, TPP-guided ventilation might be particularly useful in patients with high IAP.This study investigates the impact of large volume paracentesis LVP on TPP, EP, IAP as well as on hemodynamic and respiratory function in patients with liver cirrhosis and tense ascites.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;We analysed 23 LVP-procedures in 11 cirrhotic patients ventilated with the AVEA Viasys respirator (CareFusion, USA) which is capable to measure EP via an esophageal tube.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;LVP of a mean volume of 4826±1276 mL of ascites resulted in marked increases in inspiratory (17.9±8.9 vs. 5.4±13.3 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; p&amp;lt;0.001) as well as expiratory TPP (-3.0±4.7 vs. -15.9±10.9 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; p&amp;lt;0.001; primary endpoint). In parallel, the inspiratory (2.4±8.7 vs. 14.1±14.5 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; p&amp;lt;0.001) and expiratory EP (12.4±6.0 vs. 24.9±11.3 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; p&amp;lt;0.001) significantly decreased. The effects were most pronounced for the release of the first 500 mL of ascites. LVP evoked substantial decreases in IAP and central venous pressure CVP. By contrast, mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, global end-diastolic volume index, extravascular lung water index and systemic vascular resistance index did not change.Among the respiratory parameters we observed an increase in p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (247.7±60.9 vs. 208.3±46.8 mmHg; p&amp;lt;0.001) and a decrease in Oxygenation Index OI (4.8±2.0 vs. 5.8±3.1 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/mmHg; p = 0.002).

Both stem cell therapy and physical treatments have been shown to be beneficial in accelerating bone healing. However, the efficacy of combined treatment with stem cells and physical stimuli for large bone defects remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bone regeneration effects of low-power laser irradiation (LPLI) and human adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) treatments during fracture repair using a comparative rat calvarial defect model. We evaluated the viability of human ADSCs, which were cultured on a porous PLGA scaffold using an MTS assay. The critical-sized calvarial bone defect rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, LPLI group, ADSC group, and ADSC+LPLI group. Bone formation was evaluated using micro-CT. New bone formation areas and osteogenic factor expression levels were then examined by histomorphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining. Our data showed that PLGA had no cytotoxic effect on human ADSCs. Micro-CT analyses revealed that both the LPLI and ADSC groups showed improved calvarial bone defect healing compared to the control group. In addition, the ADSC+LPLI group showed significantly increased bone volume at 16 weeks after surgery. The area of new bone formation ranked as follows: control group &amp;lt; LPLI group &amp;lt; ADSC group &amp;lt; ADSC+LPLI group. There were significant differences between the groups. In addition, both ADSC and ADSC+LPLI groups showed strong signals of vWF expression. ADSC and LPLI treatments improved fracture repair in critical-sized calvarial defects in rats. Importantly, the combined treatment of ADSCs and LPLI further enhances the bone healing process.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Yan-Hsiung Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195337</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4613:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>3df21530</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan-Hsiung Wang, Jyun-Yi Wu, Su Chii Kong, Min-Hsuan Chiang, Mei-Ling Ho, Ming-Long Yeh, Chia-Hsin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Terrestrial plants can harbor endophytic fungi that may induce changes in plant physiology that in turn affect interactions with herbivorous insects. We evaluated whether the application of entomopathogenic fungi &lt;i&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; to soybean seeds could become endophytic and affect interactions with soybean aphid (&lt;i&gt;Aphis glycines&lt;/i&gt; Matsumura). It was found that &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt; population sizes increased on plants with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brunneum&lt;/i&gt; (strain F52) seed inoculum, but no significant effects were shown with analogous treatments with &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; (strain GHA). Fungi recovered from soybean plant tissues indicate that endophytism was established, and that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was more prevalent. &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium brunneum&lt;/i&gt; was only recovered from stems, but &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bassiana&lt;/i&gt; was recovered from stems and leaves. This work confirms that some entomopathogenic fungi can be endophytic in soybean, however, some of these fungi may have a negative effect on the plants by increasing susceptibility of soybean to &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glycines&lt;/i&gt;. We also used DNA sequence data to identify species of &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium&lt;/i&gt; obtained from agricultural fields in Iowa. Phylogenetic analyses, based on DNA sequence data, found that all isolates were &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt;, which is consistent with past studies indicating a cosmopolitan distribution and wide host range for this species. These results are important for understanding the dynamics of implementing environmentally sustainable measures for the control of pest insects.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Eric H.

Vandetanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of various cancers, has been reported to induce several adverse cardiac effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity using intracellular electrophysiological recordings on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), rabbit Purkinje fibers, and HEK293 cells transiently expressing human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG; the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNQ1/KCNE1 (the slowly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNJ2 (the inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) or SCN5A (the inward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;). Purkinje fiber assays and ion channel studies showed that vandetanib at concentrations of 1 and 3 μM inhibited the hERG currents and prolonged the action potential duration. Alanine scanning and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; hERG docking studies demonstrated that Y652 and F656 in the hERG S6 domain play critical roles in vandetanib binding. In hiPSC-CMs, vandetanib markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization during the AP upstroke. Ion channel studies revealed that hiPSC-CMs were more sensitive to inhibition of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; by vandetanib than in a heterogeneously expressed HEK293 cell model, consistent with the changes in the AP parameters of hiPSC-CMs. The subclasses of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs inhibited &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; currents in a dose-dependent manner in hiPSC-CMs and SCN5A-encoded HEK293 cells. The inhibitory potency of vandetanib for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; was much higher in hiPSC-CMs (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2.72 μM) than in HEK293 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 36.63 μM).

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Apigenin can exert beneficial actions in the prevention of obesity. However, its putative action on obesity-associated bowel motor dysfunctions is unknown. This study examined the effects of apigenin on colonic inflammatory and motor abnormalities in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt; Experimental approach &lt;p&gt;Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with standard diet (SD) or high-fat diet (HFD). SD or HFD mice were treated with apigenin (10 mg/Kg/day). After 8 weeks, body and epididymal fat weight, as well as cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels were evaluated. Malondialdehyde (MDA), IL-1β and IL-6 levels, and &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression were also examined. Colonic infiltration by eosinophils, as well as substance P (SP) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expressions were evaluated. Motor responses elicited under blockade of NOS and tachykininergic contractions were recorded &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from colonic longitudinal muscle preparations.&lt;/p&gt; Key results &lt;p&gt;When compared to SD mice, HFD animals displayed increased body weight, epididymal fat weight and metabolic indexes. HFD mice showed increments in colonic MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 levels, as well as a decrease in &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in both colonic and epididymal tissues. HFD mice displayed an increase in colonic eosinophil infiltration. Immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in SP and iNOS expression in myenteric ganglia of HFD mice. In preparations from HFD mice, electrically evoked contractions upon NOS blockade or mediated by tachykininergic stimulation were enhanced. In HFD mice, Apigenin counteracted the increase in body and epididymal fat weight, as well as the alterations of metabolic indexes. Apigenin reduced also MDA, IL-1β and IL-6 colonic levels as well as eosinophil infiltration, SP and iNOS expression, along with a normalization of electrically evoked tachykininergic and nitrergic contractions. In addition, apigenin normalized &lt;i&gt;let-7f&lt;/i&gt; expression in epididymal fat tissues, but not in colonic specimens.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions and implications &lt;p&gt;Apigenin prevents systemic metabolic alterations, counteracts enteric inflammation and normalizes colonic dysmotility associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagementRate>3.0</engagementRate><published>1523480400000</published><title>The flavonoid compound apigenin prevents colonic inflammation and motor dysfunctions associated with high fat diet-induced obesity</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006039</originId><author><name>Timothy E.

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006039</href></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006039</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826d:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><fingerprint>643ea0e5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy E.

Increased production of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and their widespread application in industrial and consumer products have led to a rise in the release of CNTs into the aquatic environment. CNTs have a very strong adsorption affinity for various environmental contaminants; therefore, they may also influence the toxic effects of other pollutants, such as toxic metals. In this study, the effect of two different functionalized carbon nanotubes, carboxylate and polyethyleneimine modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (C-MWCNTs and N-MWCNT, respectively) on lead toxicity and bioaccumulation was investigated with a freshwater zooplankton &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt;. The acute toxicity results indicate that the different surface properties of the two types of MWCNTs have different effects on lead toxicity to &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magna&lt;/i&gt;. The negatively charged C-MWCNT showed a notable decrease in lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.08 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; C-MWCNT), whereas the positively charged N-MWCNT had only a slight effect on lead toxicity (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value increased from 0.15 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; to 0.16 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of 10 mg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; N-MWCNT). The decrease of lead toxicity was related with the reduced bioavailability of free metal form (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) caused by greater adsorption of lead onto the MWCNTs. The present study suggests that there is a need to consider carefully the complex interaction of CNTs with toxic metals in future ecotoxicological studies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Min-Hee Jang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194935</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0c:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>d544b27b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Min-Hee Jang, Yu Sik Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day.

In human sleep studies, the probability of discomfort from the electrodes and the change in environment usually results in first-night recordings being discarded. Sleep recordings from the first night in human subjects often differ in amount of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and the overall sleep architecture. This study investigated whether recordings of sleep states in dairy cows also show a first-night effect. Non-invasive electrophysiological recordings were carried out on nine cows of the Swedish Red breed during three consecutive 24-hour periods (recording days 1–3). Overall, cows spent 12.9 ± 1.4 hours awake, 8.2 ± 1 hours ruminating, 57.2 ± 20.3 min drowsing, 44.1 ± 20.2 min in REM sleep and 64.3 ± 38.1 min in NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep (mean ± SD) and there were no significant differences between recording days in total duration for any of the sleep and awake states. However, the bouts of REM sleep and rumination were longer, and the awake bouts were shorter, at night time compared to daytime, regardless of recording day. The awake bouts also showed an interaction effect with longer bouts at daytime during day 1 compared to daytime on day 3. Data on sleep and awake states recorded in adult dairy cows during three consecutive 24-h periods showed great variation in sleep time between cows, but total time for each state was not significantly affected by recording day. Further and more detailed studies of how sleep architecture is affected by recording day is necessary to fully comprehend the first-night effect in dairy cows.</description><published>1523653200000</published><title>First-night effect on sleep time in dairy cows</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</originId><author><name>Stanley E.

Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%–29%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%–53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%–39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/h-ldp2fjUm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</href></item></canonical><engagement>23</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16291bed3a0:b8480a:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522863625120</crawled><fingerprint>37283983</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stanley E.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Eric Bonnet</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d736:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand.

Bacteriophage TP-84 is a well-characterized bacteriophage of historical interest. It is a member of the &lt;i&gt;Siphoviridae&lt;/i&gt;, and infects a number of thermophilic &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;) &lt;i&gt;stearothermophilus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Its’ 47.7-kbp double-stranded DNA genome revealed the presence of 81 coding sequences (CDSs) coding for polypeptides of 4 kDa or larger. Interestingly, all CDSs are oriented in the same direction, pointing to a dominant transcription direction of one DNA strand. Based on a homology search, a hypothetical function could be assigned to 31 CDSs. No RNA or DNA polymerase-coding genes were found on the bacteriophage genome indicating that TP-84 relies on the host’s transcriptional and replication enzymes. The TP84 genome is tightly packed with CDSs, typically spaced by several-to-tens of bp or often overlapping. The genome contains five putative promoter-like sequences showing similarity to the host promoter consensus sequence and allowing for a 2-bp mismatch.

Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84%, 79%, 72%, and 69% for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6%, 8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53%) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16%).

Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in two of two ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Mavigner, M., Raper, J., Kovacs-Balint, Z., Gumber, S., ONeal, J.

Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in two of two ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522864189000</published><title>[Research Articles] Postnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195356</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195356</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195356</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Imasaki, Sabine Wenzel, Kentaro Yamada, Megan L.

The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly.

The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3). Thus, the most common STs were ST4 and ST9.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; is a significant cause of morbidity among random heterosexual patients with genital chlamydial infections in the Saratov Region.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Gal Keren-Aviram</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9ba:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Proteomic analysis of human epileptic neocortex predicts vascular and glial changes in epileptic regions</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35664</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35664</link><crawled>1521462104231</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521417600000</published><author><name>jglas03@emory.edu (Jonathan D Glass)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35664</canonicalUrl><engagement>6</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1623e3550a7:25e83d9:7d6c1c1c</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35664</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ce97824f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Maintaining the connections between nerve cells and muscle could help to slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Maintaining the connections between nerve cells and muscle could help to slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</content></summary><title>Protecting the nerve terminals</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01615</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>185</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01615/20180411/images/medium/jm-2017-01615x_0011.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01615</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/QrZBaCa0yuQ/acs.jmedchem.7b01615</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523419200000</published><author><name>Tong Che, Shuo-Bin Chen, Jia-Li Tu, Bo Wang, Yu-Qing Wang, Yan Zhang, Jing Wang, Zeng-Qing Wang, Ze-Peng Zhang, Tian-Miao Ou, Yong Zhao, Jia-Heng Tan, Zhi-Shu Huang</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01615</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162b664ab23:5eec0f:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523478473507</crawled><fingerprint>b5a3b587</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01615/20180411/images/medium/jm-2017-01615x_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01615&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts. Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Kanes Sucharitakul</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f1:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>58760b3b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kanes Sucharitakul, Marie-Claude Boily, Dobromir Dimitrov, Kate M.

New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts. Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>Influence of model assumptions about HIV disease progression after initiating or stopping treatment on estimates of infections and deaths averted by scaling up antiretroviral therapy</title></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Artificial_Intelligence_Recognizes_-Lapachone_as_an_Allosteric_5-_Lipoxygenase_Inhibitor/6026795</originId><published>1522108800000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Artificial_Intelligence_Recognizes_-Lapachone_as_an_Allosteric_5-_Lipoxygenase_Inhibitor/6026795</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>3</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Artificial_Intelligence_Recognizes_-Lapachone_as_an_Allosteric_5-_Lipoxygenase_Inhibitor/6026795</link><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16267b961cc:612c385:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522158625228</crawled><fingerprint>28ccb816</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><description>Chemical matter with often-discarded moieties entails opportunities for drug discovery.

We present a fast, robust and parsimonious approach to detecting signals in an ordered sequence of numbers. Our motivation is in seeking a suitable method to take a sequence of scores corresponding to properties of positions in virus genomes, and find outlying regions of low scores. Suitable statistical methods without using complex models or making many assumptions are surprisingly lacking. We resolve this by developing a method that detects regions of low score within sequences of real numbers. The method makes no assumptions &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; about the length of such a region; it gives the explicit location of the region and scores it statistically. It does not use detailed mechanistic models so the method is fast and will be useful in a wide range of applications. We present our approach in detail, and test it on simulated sequences. We show that it is robust to a wide range of signal morphologies, and that it is able to capture multiple signals in the same sequence. Finally we apply it to viral genomic data to identify regions of evolutionary conservation within influenza and rotavirus.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Julia R.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels.

Neurons require a nearly constant supply of ATP. Glucose is the predominant source of brain ATP, but the direct effects of prolonged glucose deprivation on neuronal viability and function remain unclear. In sparse rat hippocampal microcultures, neurons were surprisingly resilient to 16 h glucose removal in the absence of secondary excitotoxicity. Neuronal survival and synaptic transmission were unaffected by prolonged removal of exogenous glucose. Inhibition of lactate transport decreased microculture neuronal survival during concurrent glucose deprivation, suggesting that endogenously released lactate is important for tolerance to glucose deprivation. Tandem depolarization and glucose deprivation also reduced neuronal survival, and trace glucose concentrations afforded neuroprotection. Mass cultures, in contrast to microcultures, were insensitive to depolarizing glucose deprivation, a difference attributable to increased extracellular lactate levels. Removal of local astrocyte support did not reduce survival in response to glucose deprivation or alter evoked excitatory transmission, suggesting that on-demand, local lactate shuttling is not necessary for neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose removal. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenously produced lactate available globally in the extracellular milieu sustains neurons in the absence of glucose. A better understanding of resilience mechanisms in reduced preparations could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed to bolster these mechanisms in vulnerable neuronal populations.</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Ambient but not local lactate underlies neuronal tolerance to prolonged glucose deprivation</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00717</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>264</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00717/20180411/images/medium/ci-2017-007172_0008.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00717</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jcisd8/~3/8XQhUy0QtwU/acs.jcim.7b00717</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523419200000</published><author><name>Xiaozheng Zhang, Fengchao Cui, Hongqian Chen, Tianshu Zhang, Kecheng Yang, Yibo Wang, Zhenyan Jiang, Kenner C.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Dana Brabcová</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (KP) is after &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EC) the most common gram-negative species causing invasive infections. Herein, we analyzed risk factors and prognosis in invasive infections caused by KP versus EC, in an area with low antimicrobial resistance. Moreover, we compared antimicrobial resistance and relative prevalence of KP and EC (KP/EC-ratio) in different European countries, using EARS-Net data. Adult patients admitted to Karolinska University Hospital 2006–2012 with invasive infection caused by KP (n = 599) were matched regarding sex and age with patients infected by EC. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Comorbidity was adjusted for with multivariable analysis. European data were retrieved from the EARS-Net database. No differences were observed in 7- and 30-day mortality between the groups. The 90-day mortality was significantly higher in the KP cohort (26% versus 17%, p&amp;lt;0.001), but not after adjusting for comorbidity. Malignancy was seen in 53% of the patients with KP versus 38% with EC, OR 1.86 (1.34–2.58). A significant increase in the rate of ESBL-production was observed in EC, but not in KP. The KP/EC-ratio remained stable. In contrast, European data showed increasing percentages of isolates non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins in EC and KP, and increasing KP/EC-ratio. Invasive infection caused by KP is a disease affecting patients with high comorbidity and associated with high 90-d mortality. The stable KP/EC-ratio and low occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in data from Karolinska University Hospital compared to aggregate data from 20 EARS-Net countries could be related to absence of clonal spread of multidrug-resistant KP.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>M.

Rho-GTPases are master regulators of polarity establishment and cell morphology. Positive feedback enables concentration of Rho-GTPases into clusters at the cell cortex, from where they regulate the cytoskeleton. Different cell types reproducibly generate either one (e.g. the front of a migrating cell) or several clusters (e.g. the multiple dendrites of a neuron), but the mechanistic basis for unipolar or multipolar outcomes is unclear. The design principles of Rho-GTPase circuits are captured by two-component reaction-diffusion models based on conserved aspects of Rho-GTPase biochemistry. Some such models display rapid winner-takes-all competition between clusters, yielding a unipolar outcome. Other models allow prolonged co-existence of clusters. We investigate the behavior of a simple class of models and show that while the timescale of competition varies enormously depending on model parameters, a single factor explains a large majority of this variation. The dominant factor concerns the degree to which the maximal active GTPase concentration in a cluster approaches a “saturation point” determined by model parameters. We suggest that both saturation and the effect of saturation on competition reflect fundamental properties of the Rho-GTPase polarity machinery, regardless of the specific feedback mechanism, which predict whether the system will generate unipolar or multipolar outcomes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HtPVWxk38yc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006095</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d21:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523554968493</crawled><fingerprint>32706f56</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian-Geng Chiou, Samuel A.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far.

However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;.

Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I HyperSensitive region (DHS)-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Spyros Makridakis</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f18:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>8a626eb7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The root cause behind the low-grade inflammatory state seen in insulin resistant (obesity and type 2 diabetes) states is unclear. Insulin resistant subjects have elevations in plasma free fatty acids (FFA), which are ligands for the pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor (TLR)4 pathway. We tested the hypothesis that an experimental elevation in plasma FFA (within physiological levels) in lean individuals would upregulate TLR4 and activate downstream pathways (e.g., MAPK) in circulating monocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Research design and methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve lean, normal glucose-tolerant subjects received a low dose (30 ml/h) 48 h lipid or saline infusion on two different occasions. Monocyte TLR4 protein level, MAPK phosphorylation, and expression of genes in the TLR pathway were determined before and after each infusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The lipid infusion significantly increased monocyte TLR4 protein and phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. Lipid-mediated increases in TLR4 and p38 phosphorylation directly correlated with reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity (M value). Lipid increased levels of multiple genes linked to inflammation, including several TLRs, CD180, MAP3K7, and CXCL10. Monocytes exposed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; to lipid infusion exhibited enhanced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; basal and LPS-stimulated IL-1β secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In lean subjects, a small increase in plasma FFA (as seen in insulin resistant subjects) is sufficient to upregulate TLR4 and stimulate inflammatory pathways (MAPK) in monocytes. Moreover, lipids prime monocytes to endotoxin. We provide proof-of-concept data in humans indicating that the low-grade inflammatory state characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes could be caused (at least partially) by pro-inflammatory monocytes activated by excess lipids present in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Hanyu Liang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195810</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cd:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>26ad51de</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanyu Liang, Helen Lum, Andrea Alvarez, Jose de Jesus Garduno-Garcia, Benjamin J.

Due to low efficacy of classic antimicrobial drugs, finding new active preparations attracts much attention. In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt; biomass waste.

Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm properties of AgNPs (alone and in combination with FLC) were also tested.

&lt;i&gt;Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus&lt;/i&gt; (CGMMV) is an economically important pathogen and causes significant reduction of both yield and quality of cucumber (&lt;i&gt;Cucumis sativus&lt;/i&gt;). Currently, there were no satisfied strategies for controlling the disease. A better understanding of microRNA (miRNA) expression related to the regulation of plant-virus interactions and virus resistance would be of great assistance when developing control strategies for CGMMV. However, accurate expression analysis is highly dependent on robust and reliable reference gene used as an internal control for normalization of miRNA expression. Most commonly used reference genes involved in CGMMV-infected cucumber are not universally expressed depending on tissue types and stages of plant development. It is therefore crucial to identify suitable reference genes in investigating the role of miRNA expression. In this study, seven reference genes, including &lt;i&gt;Actin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tubulin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S rRNA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ubiquitin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cyclophilin&lt;/i&gt;, were evaluated for the most accurate results in analyses using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Gene expression was assayed on cucumber leaves, stems and roots that were collected at different days post inoculation with CGMMV. The expression data were analyzed using algorithms including delta-Ct, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper as well as the comparative tool RefFinder. The reference genes were subsequently validated using miR159. The results showed that &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; were the most reliable reference genes for normalizing miRNA expression in leaf, root and stem samples, while &lt;i&gt;Ubiquitin&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt; were the most suitable combination overall.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Chaoqiong Liang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194436</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a620:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>6573054b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chaoqiong Liang, Jianjun Hao, Yan Meng, Laixin Luo, Jianqiang Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Eva Wuerfel</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194873</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bd:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>bb9857b5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Wuerfel, Almuth Weddige, York Hagmayer, Rebecca Jacob, Lisa Wedekind, Wiebke Stark, Jutta Gärtner&lt;/p&gt;

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; in reproduction and lipid metabolism in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt;.

There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields. Moreover, after large-scale expression and protein purification, only the scTCR format was obtained in high yields. Importantly, stability engineering of the scTCR was a prerequisite for obtaining reliable biophysical characterization of the TCR-pMHC interaction. The scTCR format is readily compatible with high-throughput screening approaches that may enable both development of reagents allowing for defined peptide MHC (pMHC) characterization and discovery of potential novel therapeutic leads.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Kristin Støen Gunnarsen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195868</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d4:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>12e8fc96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kristin Støen Gunnarsen, Lene Støkken Høydahl, Ralf Stefan Neumann, Kaare Bjerregaard-Andersen, Nicolay Rustad Nilssen, Ludvig Magne Sollid, Inger Sandlie, Geir Åge Løset&lt;/p&gt;

These results suggest that RAs produced by Aldh1a1 in the neural retina directs dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 upregulation in the dorsal RPE cells to enhance RPE-derived VEGF secretion.</content></summary><title>Neural retina-specific Aldh1a1 controls dorsal choroidal vascular development via Sox9 expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34282</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34282</link><crawled>1521033579507</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1520985600000</published><author><name>vaclav.gergelits@img.cas.cz (Barbora Valiskova)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34282</canonicalUrl><engagement>3</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16224aa8bf3:30b79d:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34282</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>f0ae59f7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item><item>Genomics and Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><description>Hybrid sterility is one of the reproductive isolation mechanisms leading to speciation. &lt;i&gt;Prdm9&lt;/i&gt;, the only known vertebrate hybrid sterility gene, causes failure of meiotic chromosome synapsis and infertility in male hybrids between two mouse subspecies.

To ensure online collaborative learning meets the intended pedagogical goals (is actually collaborative and stimulates learning), mechanisms are needed for monitoring the efficiency of online collaboration. Various studies have indicated that social network analysis can be particularly effective in studying students’ interactions in online collaboration. However, research in education has only focused on the theoretical potential of using SNA, not on the actual benefits they achieved. This study investigated how social network analysis can be used to monitor online collaborative learning, find aspects in need of improvement, guide an informed intervention, and assess the efficacy of intervention using an experimental, observational repeated-measurement design in three courses over a full-term duration. Using a combination of SNA-based visual and quantitative analysis, we monitored three SNA constructs for each participant: the level of interactivity, the role, and position in information exchange, and the role played by each participant in the collaboration. On the group level, we monitored interactivity and group cohesion indicators. Our monitoring uncovered a non-collaborative teacher-centered pattern of interactions in the three studied courses as well as very few interactions among students, limited information exchange or negotiation, and very limited student networks dominated by the teacher. An intervention based on SNA-generated insights was designed. The intervention was structured into five actions: increasing awareness, promoting collaboration, improving the content, preparing teachers, and finally practicing with feedback. Evaluation of the intervention revealed that it has significantly enhanced student-student interactions and teacher-student interactions, as well as produced a collaborative pattern of interactions among most students and teachers. Since efficient and communicative activities are essential prerequisites for successful content discussion and for realizing the goals of collaboration, we suggest that our SNA-based approach will positively affect teaching and learning in many educational domains. Our study offers a proof-of-concept of what SNA can add to the current tools for monitoring and supporting teaching and learning in higher education.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Mohammed Saqr</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194777</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b3:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>beef5ab5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammed Saqr, Uno Fors, Matti Tedre, Jalal Nouri&lt;/p&gt;

One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner network problems: given a reference &apos;&apos;database&apos;&apos; graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C - epsilon, for every C greater than or equal to 2 and epsilon &gt; 0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Wu, J.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/13/300012</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162c0c94bb2:18f7471:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523652840370</crawled><fingerprint>5b260ad0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><description>Network connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression.

Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Connectivity Problems on Heterogeneous Graphs [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Inka Aho</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123922:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>f1ad52a1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</href></item></canonical><engagement>4</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003998</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523555694285</crawled><fingerprint>6886410e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>0.4</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Atypical meningiomas are common central nervous system neoplasms with high recurrence rate and poorer prognosis compared to their grade I counterparts. Surgical excision and radiotherapy remains the mainstay therapy but medical treatments are limited. We explore new drug candidates using computational drug repurposing based on the gene expression signature of atypical meningioma tissue with subsequent analysis of drug-generated expression profiles. We further explore possible mechanisms of action for the identified drug candidates using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted gene expression profiles for atypical meningiomas (12 samples) and normal meningeal tissue (4 samples) from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which were then used to generate a gene signature comprising of 281 differentially expressed genes. Drug candidates were explored using both the Board Institute Connectivity Map (cmap) and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). Functional analysis of significant differential gene expression for drug candidates was performed with IPA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using our integrated approach, we identified multiple, already licensed, drug candidates such as emetine, verteporfin, phenoxybenzamine and trazodone. Analysis with IPA revealed that these drugs target signal cascades potentially relevant in pathogenesis of meningiomas, particular examples are the effect on ERK by trazodone, MAP kinases by emetine, and YAP-1 protein by verteporfin.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Gene expression profiling and use of drug expression profiles have yielded several plausible drug candidates for treating atypical meningioma, some of which have already been suggested by preceding studies.

Beyond proposing already approved drug candidates in the management of atypical meningioma the study highlights the promise held by computational techniques in improving our management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>New drug candidates for treatment of atypical meningiomas: An integrated approach using gene expression signatures for drug repurposing</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022153?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022153?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022153?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1520827177000</published><author><name>Yannick J.

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Hisashi Tanaka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195099</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd84:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>ba541727</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0–3], [4–8] and [9–18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt;) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Celine Saint-Laurent</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793635:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>8c4a69f3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celine Saint-Laurent, Stephanie Garcia, Vincent Sarrazy, Karine Dumas, Florence Authier, Sophie Sore, Albert Tran, Philippe Gual, Isabelle Gennero, Jean-Pierre Salles, Elvire Gouze&lt;/p&gt;

The tool is freely available at http://bioinfo.cipf.es/paintomics/.</description><published>1520924400000</published><title>PaintOmics 3: a web resource for the pathway analysis and visualization of multi-omics data [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195880</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah-Jo Paquette, Kim Stanford, James Thomas, Tim Reuter&lt;/p&gt;
Often &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; are harmless and/or beneficial bacteria inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract of livestock and humans. However, Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) have been linked to human disease. Cattle are the primary reservoir for STEC and STEC “super-shedders” are considered to be a major contributor in animal to animal transmission. Among STEC, O157:H7 is the most recognized serotype, but in recent years, non-O157 STEC have been increasingly linked to human disease. In Argentina and Germany, O178 is considered an emerging pathogen. Our objective was to compare populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178, O157, shiga toxin 1 and 2 in western Canadian cattle feces from a sampling pool of ~80,000 beef cattle collected at two slaughterhouses. Conventional PCR was utilized to screen 1,773 samples for presence/absence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178. A subset of samples (n = 168) was enumerated using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and proportions of O178, O157 and shiga toxins 1 &amp;amp; 2 specific-fragments were calculated as a proportion of generic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (GEC) specific-fragments. Distribution of &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by comparing &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O157 enumerations. Conventional PCR detected the presence of O178 in 873 of 1,773 samples and ddPCR found the average proportion of O178, O157, &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;stx&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the samples 2.8%, 0.6%, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.

Our results confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O178 in western Canadian cattle and ddPCR revealed O178 as a greater proportion of GEC than was O157.

Background &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have established a correlation between coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by ECG-gated chest computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular disease. Recent reports which included asymptomatic patients suggest that CAC measured on non-ECG gated CT is similarly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigates the correlation between the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and an incidental finding of CAC on a non-gated chest CT performed for non-cardiac indications in young and seemingly healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study that included 162 CT scans performed in young patients aged 18–50 years old for non-cardiac indications in our institution was conducted. CAC score (CACS) was calculated using the Agatston method. FRS was calculated and compared to the CACS using three different approaches. The correlations between the CACS and several specific factors (i.e. age, body mass index, smoking, statins, etc.), were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean age of patients was 36.43 year old and 105 (64.8%) were male. We found a significant positive correlation between the CACS and the FRS in all three approaches (p&amp;lt;0.05). Increased age, smoking and statin use were the only individual factors clearly associated with an increase in CACS (p = 0.002, p = 0.045 and p = 0.009, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This is the first report indicating that incidental CACS identified in non-gated MDCT is also associated with cardiovascular risk evaluated by FRS in a young population. Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Gabriel Lichtenstein</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195061</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4257:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>95b0b8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriel Lichtenstein, Amichai Perlman, Shoshana Shpitzen, Ronen Durst, Dorit Shaham, Eran Leitersdorf, Auryan Szalat&lt;/p&gt;

Our findings suggest that young asymptomatic individuals with incidental CAC should be seriously evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors despite presumption of belonging to a low cardiovascular risk category.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Correlation between coronary artery calcification by non-cardiac CT and Framingham score in young patients</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03920-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Douwe Draaisma enjoys Michael Gazzaniga’s exploration of the biological basis of consciousness.</content></content><published>1522825200000</published><author><name>Douwe Draaisma</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>96</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162901f97dc:9be8859:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522836412380</crawled><fingerprint>7b7f5699</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From meat to mind: the root of consciousness, Published online: 04 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03920-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03920-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Douwe Draaisma enjoys Michael Gazzaniga’s exploration of the biological basis of consciousness.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03920-z/d41586-018-03920-z_15570306.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>From meat to mind: the root of consciousness</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194264</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194264</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194264</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dailson Paulucio, Augusto Terra, Caleb G.

Ethanol (ET) is a substance that modulates the Central Nervous System (CNS). Frequently, ET intake occurs combined with energy drinks, which contain taurine (TA), an important amino acid found in the body (i.e brain and muscles). Although TA administration has been used in the improvement of physical performance, the impact of TA, ET and exercise remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the acute effect of 6g of Taurine (TA), 0.6 mL∙kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ethanol (ET), and Taurine combined with Ethanol (TA+ET) ingestion on the electrocortical activity before and after a moderate intensity exercise in 9 subjects, 5 women (counterbalanced experimental design). In each of the 4 treatments (Placebo—PL, TA, ET and TA+ET), electroencephalography (EEG) tests were conducted in order to analyze changes in absolute beta power (ABP) in the frontal lobe in 3 moments: baseline (before ingestion), peak (before exercise) and post-exercise. In the PL treatment, the frontal areas showed decrease in ABP after exercise. However, in the ET+TA treatment, ABP values were greater after exercise, except for Fp1. The ET treatment had no effect on the Superior Frontal Gyrus area (F3, Fz and F4) and ABP decreased after exercise in Fp1 and Fp2. In the TA treatment, ABP increased after exercise, while it decreased at the peak moment in most of the frontal regions, except for Fp1, F3 and Fz. We concluded that after a moderate intensity exercise, a decrease in cortical activity occurs in placebo treatment. Moreover, we found a inhibitory effect of TA on cortical activity before exercise and a increased in cortical activity after exercise. A small ET dose is not enough to alter ABP in all regions of the frontal cortex and, in combination with TA, it showed an increase in the frontal cortex activity at the post-exercise moment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Dailson Paulucio</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194264</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cfa0b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>1d017377</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dailson Paulucio, Augusto Terra, Caleb G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of efforts to eliminate tuberculosis (TB) in the United States (US), TB still contributes to adverse ill health, especially among racial/ethnic minorities. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2016, about 87% of the TB cases reported in the US were among racial and ethnic minorities. The objective of this study is to explore the risks for pregnancy complications and in-hospital death among mothers diagnosed with TB across racial/ethnic groups in the US.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study utilized National Inpatient Sample data for all inpatient hospital discharges in the US. We analyzed pregnancy-related hospitalizations and births in the US from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2014 (n = 57,393,459). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to generate odds ratios for the association between TB status and the primary study outcomes (i.e., pregnancy complications and in-hospital death) across racial/ethnic categories.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of TB was 7.1 per 100,000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations. The overall prevalence of pregnancy complications was 80% greater among TB-infected mothers than their uninfected counterparts. Severe pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, placenta previa, post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis and anemia occurred with greater frequency among mothers with a TB diagnosis than those without TB, irrespective of race/ethnicity. The rate of in-hospital death among TB patients was 37 times greater among TB-infected than in non-TB infected mothers (468.8 per 100,000 versus 12.6 per 100,000). A 3-fold increased risk of in-hospital death was observed among black TB-negative mothers compared to their white counterparts. No racial/ethnic disparities in maternal morbidity or in-hospital death were found among mothers with TB disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TB continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women in the US. Resources to address TB disease should also target pregnant women, especially racial/ethnic minorities who bear the greatest burden of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Erika M.

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Kris A.

The growing volume and heterogeneity of these sequencing data complicate the further optimization of methods for identifying DNA variation, especially considering that curated high-confidence variant call sets commonly used to evaluate these methods are generally developed by reference to results from the analysis of comparatively small and homogeneous sample sets. We have developed xAtlas, an application for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in NGS data. xAtlas is easily scalable and enables execution and retraining with rapid development cycles.

The growing volume and heterogeneity of these sequencing data complicate the further optimization of methods for identifying DNA variation, especially considering that curated high-confidence variant call sets commonly used to evaluate these methods are generally developed by reference to results from the analysis of comparatively small and homogeneous sample sets. We have developed xAtlas, an application for the identification of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in NGS data. xAtlas is easily scalable and enables execution and retraining with rapid development cycles. Generation of variant calls in VCF or gVCF format from BAM or CRAM alignments is accomplished in less than one CPU-hour per 30x short-read human whole-genome. The retraining capabilities of xAtlas allow its core variant evaluation models to be optimized on new sample data and user-defined truth sets. Obtaining SNV and indels calls from xAtlas can be achieved more than 40 times faster than established methods while retaining the same accuracy.</description><published>1522911600000</published><title>xAtlas: Scalable small variant calling across heterogeneous next-generation sequencing experiments [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299107v1?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299107v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/299107v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Transcriptional regulation is extremely complicated.

Ocular tuberculosis (TB) commonly causes severe inflammation and vision loss in TB-endemic countries. The mechanism by which tuberculous infection becomes established in the eye is poorly understood. We have developed the zebrafish larva infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium marinum&lt;/i&gt; as a model to study the early pathogenesis of ocular TB. We find that hematogenous bacterial seeding of the eye occurs despite a functional blood retinal barrier. Prototypical early granulomas form in response to bacteria in the eye. These granulomas involve the retinal vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex which are characteristic locations for human ocular TB. We find that peripheral blood monocytes are recruited to the nascent ocular granuloma further suggesting that the immune privileged nature of the eye is breached by this inflammatory focus.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Kevin Takaki</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194982</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>4c6f02bb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Takaki, Lalita Ramakrishnan, Soumyava Basu&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up. Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the antibiotic regimen of first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Anneleen Berende</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76932:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>fd66eebf</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anneleen Berende, Lisette Nieuwenhuis, Hadewych J.

In the field of the social psychology of prejudice, John Duckitt&apos;s Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice has gained a firm grounding over the past decade and a half, while empathy has become one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, alongside right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1).

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Predictors of long term weight loss maintenance in patients at high risk of type 2 diabetes participating in a lifestyle intervention program in primary health care: The DE-PLAN study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jemima Amery-Gale, Carol A.

Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. &lt;i&gt;Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a powerful owl (&lt;i&gt;Ninox strenua&lt;/i&gt;) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to &lt;i&gt;Avian avulavirus 5&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a musk lorikeet (&lt;i&gt;Glossopsitta concinna&lt;/i&gt;). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (&lt;i&gt;Cacatua galerita&lt;/i&gt;) and a tawny frogmouth (&lt;i&gt;Podargus strigoides&lt;/i&gt;). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Jemima Amery-Gale</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c8:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>88d52e54</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jemima Amery-Gale, Carol A.

Motivation &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can impair cerebral vasoreactivity and is associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, an easy-to-use, non-invasive, portable monitor of cerebral vasoreactivity does not exist. Therefore, we have evaluated the use of near-infrared diffuse correlation spectroscopy to measure the microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to a mild head-of-bed position change as a biomarker for the evaluation of cerebral vasoreactivity alteration due to chronic OSA. Furthermore, we have monitored the effect of two years of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on the cerebral vasoreactivity.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;CBF was measured at different head-of-bed position changes (supine to 30° to supine) in sixty-eight patients with OSA grouped according to severity (forty moderate to severe, twenty-eight mild) and in fourteen control subjects without OSA. A subgroup (n = 13) with severe OSA was measured again after two years of CPAP treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All patients and controls showed a similar CBF response after changing position from supine to 30° (p = 0.819), with a median (confidence interval) change of -17.5 (-10.3, -22.9)%. However, when being tilted back to the supine position, while the control group (p = 0.091) and the mild patients with OSA (p = 0.227) recovered to the initial baseline, patients with moderate and severe OSA did not recover to the baseline (9.8 (0.8, 12.9)%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) suggesting altered cerebral vasoreactivity. This alteration was correlated with OSA severity defined by the apnea-hypopnea index, and with mean nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation. The CBF response was normalized after two years of CPAP treatment upon follow-up measurements.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, microvascular CBF response to a head-of-bed challenge measured by diffuse correlation spectroscopy suggests that moderate and severe patients with OSA have altered cerebral vasoreactivity related to OSA severity.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between stone composition and single-energy noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) parameters, including stone heterogeneity index (SHI) and mean stone density (MSD), in patients with urinary calculi. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 255 patients who underwent operations or procedures for urinary stones or had spontaneous stone passage between December 2014 and October 2015. Among these, 214 patients with urinary calculi who underwent NCCT and stone composition analyses were included in the study. Maximal stone length (MSL), mean stone density (MSD), and stone heterogeneity index (SHI) were determined on pretreatment NCCT. The mean MSD (454.68±177.80 HU) and SHI (115.82±96.31 HU) of uric acid stones were lower than those of all other types. Based on post hoc tests, MSD was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001).

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group.

The Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq, coupled with transcription-factor motif analysis, provides indirect evidence of chromatin binding for hundreds of TFs genome-wide. Here, we propose methods for TRN inference in a mammalian setting, using ATAC-seq data to influence gene expression modeling. We rigorously test our methods in the context of T Helper Cell Type 17 (Th17) differentiation, generating new ATAC-seq data to complement existing Th17 genomic resources (plentiful gene expression data, TF knock-outs and ChIP-seq experiments). In this resource-rich mammalian setting our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (&amp;quot;TF-TF modules&amp;quot;) in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Miraldi, E.

We rigorously test our methods in the context of T Helper Cell Type 17 (Th17) differentiation, generating new ATAC-seq data to complement existing Th17 genomic resources (plentiful gene expression data, TF knock-outs and ChIP-seq experiments). In this resource-rich mammalian setting our extensive benchmarking provides quantitative, genome-scale evaluation of TRN inference combining ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We refine and extend our previous Th17 TRN, using our new TRN inference methods to integrate all Th17 data (gene expression, ATAC-seq, TF KO, ChIP-seq). We highlight new roles for individual TFs and groups of TFs (&amp;quot;TF-TF modules&amp;quot;) in Th17 gene regulation. Given the popularity of ATAC-seq, which provides high-resolution with low sample input requirements, we anticipate that application of our methods will improve TRN inference in new mammalian systems, especially in vivo, for cells directly from humans and animal models.</description><published>1522566000000</published><title>Leveraging chromatin accessibility for transcriptional regulatory network inference in T Helper 17 Cells [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2670.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2670.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Traces of life are nearly ubiquitous on Earth.

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Naphtali Savion</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>4b507ec5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</description><published>1522098000000</published><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;S&amp;lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&amp;lt;i&gt;N&amp;lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine protects against oxidative stress and extends lifespan in &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3816.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3816.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3816.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Public votes and referendums on the rights of marginalized communities are utilized in 27 states and occur with some regularity.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and patients &lt;p&gt;Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to describe ethnic variations in infant mortality and explore the contribution of area deprivation, mother’s country of birth, and prematurity to these variations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed routine birth and death data on singleton live births (gestational age≥22 weeks) in England and Wales, 2006–2012. Infant mortality by ethnic group was analyzed using logistic regression with adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and gestational age.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the 4,634,932 births analyzed, crude infant mortality rates were higher in Pakistani, Black Caribbean, Black African, and Bangladeshi infants (6.92, 6.00, 5.17 and 4.40 per 1,000 live births, respectively vs. 2.87 in White British infants). Adjustment for maternal sociodemographic characteristics changed the results little. Further adjustment for gestational age strongly attenuated the risk in Black Caribbean (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89–1.17) and Black African infants (1.17, 1.06–1.29) but not in Pakistani (2.32, 2.15–2.50), Bangladeshi (1.47, 1.28–1.69), and Indian infants (1.24, 1.11–1.38). Ethnic variations in infant mortality differed significantly between term and preterm infants. At term, South Asian groups had higher risks which cannot be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. In preterm infants, adjustment for degree of prematurity (&amp;lt;28, 28–31, 32–33, 34–36 weeks) fully explained increased risks in Black but not Pakistani and Bangladeshi infants. Sensitivity analyses with further adjustment for small for gestational age, or excluding deaths due to congenital anomalies did not fully explain the excess risk in South Asian groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Higher infant mortality in South Asian and Black infants does not appear to be explained by sociodemographic characteristics. Higher proportions of very premature infants appear to explain increased risks in Black infants but not in South Asian groups.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Hendrik P.

Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents’ behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Carolina Feher da Silva</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195328</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f67:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>fd628d0a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carolina Feher da Silva, Todd A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Negative workplace behaviour, especially negative communication is a recognised problem in many organisations and is known to have serious impact on workplace performance, productivity and personal wellbeing. Emergency Departments (ED) can be high stress environments in which communication and perceptions of respect between physicians and other staff may underlie individual functioning. We conducted a study to estimate the influence of incivility (ICV) among physicians in the ED.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed an online survey to assess workplace incivility in the ED. We focussed on frequency, origin, reasons and situations where ICV was reported. To measure the levels and the potential influence of ICV on psychological safety, social stress and personal wellbeing we correlated our questionnaire to standard psychological scales. Statistical analysis included Students t-test, chi squared distribution and Pearson correlation coefficient.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We invited all seventy-seven ED physicians to participate in our survey. Among those that completed (n = 50, 65%) the survey, 9% of ED physicians reported frequent (1/week) and 38% occasional (1/month) incidents of ICV. 28% of physicians reported experiencing ICV once per quarter and 21% reported a frequency of only once per year, no physician reported ICV on a daily basis. Levels of ICV were significantly higher in interactions with specialists from outside then within the ED (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).ICV was perceived particularly during critical situations. Our findings showed a significant correlation between internal (within the ED team) ICV and psychological safety. To ED physicians internal ICV was associated with lower levels of psychological safety (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). ICV displayed from sources outside the ED team was not associated with psychological safety, but we found a significant influence of external ICV on personal irritability and reduced wellbeing (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of incivility was high among the ED physicians. Although this was a small sample, the association between workplace ICV and psychological safety, personal irritation as well personal comfort suggests that ICV may be an important variable underlying ED team performance. These findings further underscore the need to foster a culture of respect and good communication between departments, as levels of ICV were highest with physicians from outside the ED. Future research would benefit from examining strategies to prevent and reduce ICV and identify reasons for personal variation in perception of ICV. During critical situations and in general collaboration with specialists, awareness of ICV and countermeasures are important to avoid decreased performance and negative impact on staff and patient.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Bad manners in the Emergency Department: Incivility among doctors</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195688</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195688</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195688</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195688</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ed0:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>4153be5e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Correction: Five decades on: Use of historical weaning size data reveals that a decrease in maternal foraging success underpins the long-term decline in population of southern elephant seals (&amp;lt;i&gt;Mirounga leonina&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256479v3?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256479v3?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256479v3?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Chloroplast genes and genomes are the most important genomic data for plant phylogeny and DNA barcoding.

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits’ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006048</href></item></canonical><engagement>15</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006048</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ace2bc4:b9c54f:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><fingerprint>bafb2a1e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher Ebsch, Robert Rosenbaum&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Joachim Ögren</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>fc4e7cf8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>The effect of CAG repeats length on differences in hirsutism among healthy Israeli women of different ethnicities</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01273</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>285</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01273/20180326/images/medium/ct-2017-012739_0016.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01273</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/46SHEPLSCS8/acs.jctc.7b01273</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522123200000</published><author><name>Colin K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident. Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Sun Young Lee</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194921</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf605:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>b4fda32</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sun Young Lee, Seung Chul Lee, Sang Do Shin, Kyoung Jun Song, Young Sun Ro, Jeong Ho Park, So Yeon Kong&lt;/p&gt;

Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522098000000</published><title>Epidemiology and outcomes of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25164?af=R</originId><published>1522119130699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25164?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25164?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162655ebe4b:6ce0a:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522119130699</crawled><fingerprint>4da17d0d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25144?af=R</originId><published>1522122850699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25144?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25144?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/12&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, Page 735-742, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626597818b:6ce29:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522122850699</crawled><fingerprint>58e87179</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 735-742, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 12, Page 735-742, May 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026675?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026675?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026675?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522907142000</published><author><name>Brian L.

Fossils entombed in amber are a unique resource for reconstructing forest ecosystems, and resolving relationships of modern taxa. Such fossils are famous for their perfect, life-like appearance. However, preservation quality is vast with many sites showing only cuticular preservation, or no fossils. The taphonomic processes that control this range are largely unknown; as such, we know little about potential bias in this important record. Here we employ actualistic experiments, using, fruit flies and modern tree resin to determine whether resin type, gut microbiota, and dehydration prior to entombment affects decay. We used solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) to confirm distinct tree resin chemistry; gut microbiota of flies was modified using antibiotics and categorized though sequencing. Decay was assessed using phase contrast synchrotron tomography. Resin type demonstrates a significant control on decay rate. The composition of the gut microbiota was also influential, with minor changes in composition affecting decay rate. Dehydration prior to entombment, contrary to expectations, enhanced decay.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products.

Our findings contribute to understand degradation mechanisms of TB and may elucidate previous clinical and experimental observations of cellular toxicity after TB application.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Photochemical degradation of trypan blue</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36137</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36137</link><crawled>1523359810155</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523318400000</published><author><name>lafuente@unam.mx (Victor de Lafuente)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36137</canonicalUrl><engagement>3</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162af52026b:1c292eb:923c4a60</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36137</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>c01a5db9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><engagementRate>0.21</engagementRate><description>Artificially activating neurons in the cortex can make a tetraplegic patient feel naturalistic sensations of skin pressure and arm movement.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Artificially activating neurons in the cortex can make a tetraplegic patient feel naturalistic sensations of skin pressure and arm movement.</content></summary><title>Regaining the senses of touch and movement</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3529.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3529.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3529.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small human Dependovirus whose low immunogenicity and capacity for long-term persistence have led to its widespread use as vector for gene therapy.

Background &lt;p&gt;Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy).&lt;/p&gt; Aims of the study &lt;p&gt;To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006078</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006078</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826e:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><fingerprint>35ffcce0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</href></item></canonical><engagement>30</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006032</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162688e2a3c:4d823:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522172570172</crawled><fingerprint>c4a8f063</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Vaxenburg, Isis Wyche, Karel Svoboda, Alexander L.

Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522182248935</recrawled><published>1522184400000</published><title>Dynamic cues for whisker-based object localization: An analytical solution to vibration during active whisker touch</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>136</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00336/20180412/images/medium/jm-2018-00336k_0004.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/_YchriMnQ4E/acs.jmedchem.8b00336</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523505600000</published><author><name>Haruka Sekiguchi, Tomoko Kuroyanagi, David Rhainds, Kazuya Kobayashi, Yuka Kobayashi, Hiroaki Ohno, Nikolaus Heveker, Kenichi Akaji, Nobutaka Fujii, Shinya Oishi</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162bb7bc4a3:648fd:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523563873443</crawled><fingerprint>c3a50ccc</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00336/20180412/images/medium/jm-2018-00336k_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00336&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Vasculature is an interface between the circulation and the hematopoietic tissue providing the means for hundreds of billions of blood cells to enter the circulation every day in a regulated fashion. The precise mechanisms that control the interactions of hematopoietic cells with the vessel wall are largely undefined. Here, we report on the development of an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; 3D human marrow vascular microenvironment (VME) to study hematopoietic trafficking and the release of blood cells, specifically platelets. We show that mature megakaryocytes from aspirated marrow as well as megakaryocytes differentiated in culture from CD34+ cells can be embedded in a collagen matrix containing engineered microvessels to create a thrombopoietic VME. These megakaryocytes continue to mature, penetrate the vessel wall, and release platelets into the vessel lumen. This process can be blocked with the addition of antibodies specific for CXCR4, indicating that CXCR4 is required for megakaryocyte migration, though whether it is sufficient is unclear. The 3D marrow VME system shows considerable potential for mechanistic studies defining the role of marrow vasculature in thrombopoiesis. Through a stepwise addition or removal of individual marrow components, this model provides potential to define key pathways responsible for the release of platelets and other blood cells.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Surya Kotha</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195082</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ec:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>aabb7852</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Surya Kotha, Sijie Sun, Amie Adams, Brian Hayes, Kiet T.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population. Increased awareness of the risks of cumulative radiation exposure in the young adult population is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>CT utilization abruptly increases at age 18 among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases in the hospital</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00933</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>274</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b00933/20180404/images/medium/ct-2017-00933j_0011.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00933</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/M5r4hP98e38/acs.jctc.7b00933</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522814400000</published><author><name>Julian J.

Understanding determinants shaping infection risk of endangered wildlife is a major topic in conservation medicine. The proboscis monkey, &lt;i&gt;Nasalis larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, an endemic primate flagship species for conservation in Borneo, is endangered through habitat loss, but can still be found in riparian lowland and mangrove forests, and in some protected areas. To assess socioecological and anthropogenic influence on intestinal helminth infections in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;larvatus&lt;/i&gt;, 724 fecal samples of harem and bachelor groups, varying in size and the number of juveniles, were collected between June and October 2012 from two study sites in Malaysian Borneo: 634 samples were obtained from groups inhabiting the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS), 90 samples were collected from groups of the Labuk Bay Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary (LBPMS), where monkeys are fed on stationary feeding platforms. Parasite risk was quantified by intestinal helminth prevalence, host parasite species richness (PSR), and eggs per gram feces (epg). Generalized linear mixed effect models were applied to explore whether study site, group type, group size, the number of juveniles per group, and sampling month predict parasite risk. At the LBPMS, prevalence and epg of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; spp., strongylids, and &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. but not &lt;i&gt;Ascaris&lt;/i&gt; spp., as well as host PSR were significantly elevated. Only for &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp., prevalence showed significant changes between months; at both sites, the beginning rainy season with increased precipitation was linked to higher prevalence, suggesting the external life cycle of &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides&lt;/i&gt; spp. to benefit from humidity. Higher prevalence, epgs, and PSR within the LBPMS suggest that anthropogenic factors shape host infection risk more than socioecological factors, most likely via higher re-infection rates and chronic stress. Noninvasive measurement of fecal parasite stages is an important tool for assessing transmission dynamics and infection risks for endangered tropical wildlife. Findings will contribute to healthcare management in nature and in anthropogenically managed environments.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Annette Klaus</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195584</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715299:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>d13e25d3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annette Klaus, Christina Strube, Kathrin Monika Röper, Ute Radespiel, Frank Schaarschmidt, Senthilvel Nathan, Benoit Goossens, Elke Zimmermann&lt;/p&gt;

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Roman J.

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase &amp;lt; 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in patients with a SVR. Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Tomoo Yamazaki</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecd:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>d54f7625</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomoo Yamazaki, Satoru Joshita, Takeji Umemura, Yoko Usami, Ayumi Sugiura, Naoyuki Fujimori, Takefumi Kimura, Akihiro Matsumoto, Koji Igarashi, Masao Ota, Eiji Tanaka&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</description><published>1522875600000</published><title>Changes in serum levels of autotaxin with direct-acting antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1314?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1314?rss=1</link><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521740378000</published><author><name>Stone, R.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1314.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>62</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150417:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1314?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>ce59d9cb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>European News, Neuroscience</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>U.K. attack puts nerve agent in the spotlight</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04321-y</originId><published>1523430000000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04321-y</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04321-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How gravitational waves might help fundamental cosmology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How gravitational waves might help fundamental cosmology, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04321-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04321-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New observations could help us understand discrepancies in measurements of the expansion of the Universe.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>11</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b43798d5:485e40:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523441965269</crawled><fingerprint>63045048</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How gravitational waves might help fundamental cosmology&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How gravitational waves might help fundamental cosmology, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04321-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04321-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;New observations could help us understand discrepancies in measurements of the expansion of the Universe.</description><engagementRate>0.04</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04321-y/d41586-018-04321-y_15592946.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>How gravitational waves might help fundamental cosmology</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3290.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3290.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3290.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a negative-emissions technology that may play a crucial role in climate change mitigation.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The transcription factor SOX2 has been identified as a lineage survival oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma and copy number gain is a common event in several human malignancies including head and neck cancer. However, the regulation and function of SOX2 during carcinogenesis as well as its prognostic value appears to be highly context dependent. As an example, high SOX2 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is related to a favorable prognosis, while it is associated with poor outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. More recently, higher SOX2 levels and improved survival was also reported for head and neck SCC (HNSCC), and silencing of SOX2 expression in HNSCC cell lines revealed a mesenchymal-like phenotype with prominent vimentin expression. So far, SOX2 expression and its clinical relevance for other head and neck cancers, such as adenoid cystic carcinoma (HNACC) have not been sufficiently investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Material and methods &lt;p&gt;SOX2, vimentin and E-cadherin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on serial sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples of a patient cohort (n = 45) with primary ACC and correlated with patient and tumor characteristics as well as survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;High SOX2 expression was found in 14 (31%) primary tumor specimens and was significantly correlated with a N0 lymph node status (p = 0.04), while low SOX2 expression was correlated with a solid growth pattern (p = 0.031). Of the 45 patients, 27 tumor samples resembled an EMT-like phenotype, as assessed by high vimentin and low E-cadherin levels. However, in HNACC SOX2 levels were neither correlated with vimentin nor with E-cadherin expression, further supporting a context dependent regulation and function of SOX2 in distinct tumor entities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The absence of SOX2 was predominantly found in solid HNACC, which are characterized by a more aggressive phenotype in ACC.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy.

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the risk of osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) using a nationwide population-based dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort study of 986,713 individuals, we selected 2,493 PBC patients who were aged 18 years or older and had been diagnosed with PBC, based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes 571.6, during 20002010. The control cohort comprised 9,972 randomly selected, propensity matched patients (by age, gender, and index date), without PBC. Using this adjusted data, a possible association between PBC and the risk of developing osteoporosis was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, osteoporosis was diagnosed in 150 (6.02%) patients in the PBC cohort and in 539 (5.41%) patients in the non-PBC cohort. After adjusting for covariates, osteoporosis risk was found to be 3.333 times greater in the PBC cohort than in the non-PBC cohort when measured over 6 years after PBC diagnosis. Stratification revealed that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had no significance in decreasing the risk of osteoporosis when comparing the PBC cohorts with the non-PBC cohorts (P = 0.124). Additionally, osteoporosis risk was significantly higher in PBC patients with steroid use (aHR: 6.899 vs 3.333). Moreover, when comparing the PBC cohorts to the non-PBC cohorts, the non-cirrhotic patients were prone to osteoporosis at a younger age compared to those in the cirrhotic cohorts. We also found that the associated risk of fractures is only prominent for vertebral and wrist fractures in the PBC cohort compared to that in the non-PBC cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A significant association exists between PBC and subsequent risk for osteoporosis. Therefore, PBC patients, particularly those treated with steroids, should be evaluated for subsequent risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Chen-Yi Liao</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194418</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a619:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>3569820b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chen-Yi Liao, Chi-Hsiang Chung, Pauling Chu, Kuang-yu Wei, Tseng-Min Feng, Fu-Huang Lin, Chang-Huei Tsao, Chia-Chao Wu, Wu-Chien Chien&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens. This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Anneliese S.

This study emphasises the critical nature of the vaccine carrier, adjuvant and route of delivery for optimising vaccine efficacy against TB.</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>PLGA particulate subunit tuberculosis vaccines promote humoral and Th17 responses but do not enhance control of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23446-8</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23446-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/5hrG9sK8AaQ/s41598-018-23446-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23446-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23446-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5hrG9sK8AaQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Sandra Billig</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23446-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1624cc6c7fd:3d6fea3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521706518525</crawled><fingerprint>59093db3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23446-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23446-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; in human macrophages&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/5hrG9sK8AaQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Author Correction: Lactate oxidation facilitates growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in human macrophages</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/153940v4?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/153940v4?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/153940v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA.

Climate change is expected to affect resource-consumer interactions underlying stability in polar food webs. Polar benthic organisms have adapted to the marked seasonality characterising their habitats by concentrating foraging and reproductive activity in summer months, when inputs from sympagic and pelagic producers increase. While this enables the persistence of biodiverse food webs, the mechanisms underlying changes in resource use and nutrient transfer are poorly understood. Thus, our understanding of how temporal and spatial variations in the supply of resources may affect food web structure and functioning is limited. By means of C and N isotopic analyses of two key Antarctic benthic consumers (&lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;, Bivalvia, and &lt;i&gt;Sterechinus neumayeri&lt;/i&gt;, Echinoidea) and Bayesian mixing models, we describe changes in trophic niche and nutrient transfer across trophic levels associated with the long- and short-term diet and body size of specimens sampled in midsummer in both shallow and deep waters. Samplings occurred soon after the sea-ice broke up at Tethys Bay, an area characterised by extreme seasonality in sea-ice coverage and productivity in the Ross Sea. In the long term, the trophic niche was broader and variation between specimens was greater, with intermediate-size specimens generally consuming a higher number of resources than small and large specimens. The coupling of energy channels in the food web was consequently more direct than in the short term. Sediment and benthic algae were more frequently consumed in the long term, before the sea-ice broke up, while consumers specialised on sympagic algae and plankton in the short term. Regardless of the time scale, sympagic algae were more frequently consumed in shallow waters, while plankton was more frequently consumed in deep waters. Our results suggest a strong temporal relationship between resource availability and the trophic niche of benthic consumers in Antarctica. Potential climate-driven changes in the timing and quality of nutrient inputs may have profound implications for the structure of polar food webs and the persistence of their constituent species, which have adapted their trophic niches to a highly predictable schedule of resource inputs.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Edoardo Calizza</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194796</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>4f3e0082</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Edoardo Calizza, Giulio Careddu, Simona Sporta Caputi, Loreto Rossi, Maria Letizia Costantini&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Innovative technologies and social inequalities in health: A scoping review of the literature</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3211.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3211.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3211.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cytidine deaminases of the AID/APOBEC family catalyze C-to-U nucleotide transitions in mRNA or DNA.

For CyberKnife-mediated prostate cancer treatment, a tumour-tracking approach is applied to correct the target location by acquiring X-ray images of implanted fiducial markers intermittently. This study investigated the dosimetric impact of intra-fraction prostate motion during CyberKnife treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients treated using the CyberKnife (35 Gy delivered in five fractions). Using log files of recorded prostate motion, the intra-fraction prostate motion was simulated. We defined the worst-case intra-fraction prostate motion as the difference between pre- and post-deviation on log files and shifted structure sets according to the corresponding offsets for each beam. The dose–volume indices were calculated and compared with the original plan in terms of clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (CTV plus a 2-mm margin), rectum, bladder, and urethra. Prostate motions of &gt;3, &gt;5, and &gt;10 mm were observed for 31.3, 9.1, and 0.5% of the 1929 timestamps, respectively. Relative differences between the simulated and original plans were mostly less than 1%. Although significant decreases were observed in D&lt;sub&gt;50%&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;98%&lt;/sub&gt; of the target, absolute dose differences were &amp;lt;0.1 Gy compared with the planned dose.

In 27 cases, spirometry improved more than 200 mL.No variables were found to be associated with this improvement or to explain it.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study provides information on the role of spirometry prior to hospital discharge in patients admitted for COPD exacerbation, demonstrating that it is a valid and reproducible method, representing an opportunity toimprove COPD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522098000000</published><title>Reliability and usefulness of spirometry performed during admission for COPD exacerbation</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017165?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/10&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 10&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1520827051000</published><author><name>Itay Azizi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1622364c343:d036a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521012228931</crawled><fingerprint>1852d682</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 10, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Composition, morphology, and growth of clusters in a gas of particles with random interactions</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Marine stratocumulus clouds cover nearly one-quarter of the ocean surface and thus play an extremely important role in determining the global radiative balance.

Several studies suggest that low birthweight resulting from restricted intrauterine growth can leave a metabolic footprint which may persist into adulthood. To investigate this, we performed metabolomic profiling on 5036 female twins, aged 18–80, with weight at birth information available from the TwinsUK cohort and performed independent replication in two additional cohorts. Out of 422 compounds tested, 25 metabolites associated with birthweight in these twins, replicated in 1951 men and women from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study (HCS, aged 66) and in 2391 men and women from the North Finland Birth 1986 cohort (NFBC, aged 16). We found distinct heterogeneity between sexes and, after adjusting for multiple tests and heterogeneity, two metabolites were reproducible overall (propionylcarnitine and 3-4-hydroxyphenyllactate). Testing women only, we found other metabolites associated with lower birthweight from the meta-analysis of the three cohorts (2-hydroxy-butyric acid and γ-glutamylleucine). Higher levels of all these metabolites can be linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress or a dysfunction of energy metabolism, suggesting that low birthweight in both twins and singletons are having an impact on these pathways in adulthood.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Sarah Jane Metrustry</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194316</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:412391d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>eb11472a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jane Metrustry, Ville Karhunen, Mark H.

Among them, &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was selected to determine the inhibitory effects of the compounds (including curdione, isocurcumenol, curcumenol, curzerene, β-elemene, curcumin, germacrone and curcumol) derived from &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, the antifungal activities of curdione, curcumenol, curzerene, curcumol and isocurcumenol and the synergies of the complexes of curdione and seven other chemicals were investigated. Differential proteomics of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was also compared, and at least 2021 reproducible protein spots were identified. Among these spots, 46 were classified as differentially expressed proteins, and these proteins are involved in energy metabolism, tRNA synthesis and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, several fungal physiological differences were also analysed. The antifungal effect included fungal cell membrane disruption and inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, respiration, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and NADH oxidase.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Ciqiong Chen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194284</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e14:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>64ce5708</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ciqiong Chen, Li Long, Fusheng Zhang, Qin Chen, Cheng Chen, Xiaorui Yu, Qingya Liu, Jinku Bao, Zhangfu Long&lt;/p&gt;

Differential proteomics of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; was also compared, and at least 2021 reproducible protein spots were identified. Among these spots, 46 were classified as differentially expressed proteins, and these proteins are involved in energy metabolism, tRNA synthesis and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, several fungal physiological differences were also analysed. The antifungal effect included fungal cell membrane disruption and inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, respiration, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and NADH oxidase.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Antifungal activity, main active components and mechanism of &amp;lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&amp;lt;/i&gt; extract against &amp;lt;i&gt;Fusarium graminearum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00097</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>293</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00097/20180320/images/medium/cb-2018-00097e_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00097</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/mELqE8OL5AE/acschembio.8b00097</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521518400000</published><author><name>Geng Li, Chenhui He, Peixuan Bu, Huimin Bi, Sichen Pan, Ronghua Sun, Xin Sheng Zhao</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00097</link><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16244ad3c73:1b5013:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521570626675</crawled><fingerprint>dd8769a4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00097/20180320/images/medium/cb-2018-00097e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00097&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

This study asks the question on which national “shoulders” the world’s top-level research stands. Traditionally, the number of citations to national papers has been the evaluative measures of national scientific standings. We raise a different question: instead of analyzing the citations to a countries’ articles (the forward view), we examine references to prior publications from specific countries cited in the most elite publications (the backward—citing—view). “Elite publications” are operationalized as the top-1% most-highly cited articles. Using the articles published from 2004 to 2013, we examine the research referenced in these works. Our results confirm the well-known fact that China has emerged to become a major player in science. However, China still belongs to the low contributors when countries are ranked as contributors to the cited references in top-1% articles. Using this perspective, the results do not support a decreasing trend for the USA; in fact, the USA exceeds expectations (compared to its publication share) in terms of references in the top-1% articles. Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands also appear at the top of the list. However, the results for Germany are lower than statistically expected.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Lutz Bornmann</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194805</canonicalUrl><engagement>11</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5fb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>8e2a8d69</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lutz Bornmann, Caroline Wagner, Loet Leydesdorff&lt;/p&gt;

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3’-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal &lt;i&gt;hunchback&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;hb&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described—repression of maternal &lt;i&gt;bicoid&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3’-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of &lt;i&gt;bcd&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in testes.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Tammy H.

Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a heterozygous deletion of 26–28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23. The complete deletion (CD) mouse model mimics the most common deletion found in WBS patients and recapitulates most neurologic features of the disorder along with some cardiovascular manifestations leading to significant cardiac hypertrophy with increased cardiomyocytes’ size. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin found in green tea, has been associated with potential health benefits, both on cognition and cardiovascular phenotypes, through several mechanisms. We aimed to investigate the effects of green tea extracts on WBS-related phenotypes through a phase I clinical trial in mice. After feeding CD animals with green tea extracts dissolved in the drinking water, starting at three different time periods (prenatal, youth and adulthood), a set of behavioral tests and several anatomical, histological and molecular analyses were performed. Treatment resulted to be effective in the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy and was also able to ameliorate short-term memory deficits of CD mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG might have a therapeutic and/or preventive role in the management of WBS.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Paula Ortiz-Romero</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194476</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fc:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>b6faf5d3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula Ortiz-Romero, Cristina Borralleras, Mònica Bosch-Morató, Biuse Guivernau, Guillermo Albericio, Francisco J.

Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation.

Douchi has been consumed as a flavoring ingredient for centuries. During production of douchi, numerous microorganisms play important roles in the hydrolysis and conversion of proteins and starch, which are related to the quality and flavor of the end product. Therefore, in the present study, the microbial diversity in two types of home-made traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China was studied by high-throughput sequencing, and a corresponding analysis of the bacterial and fungal communities were conducted. The results showed that geography may have impacted the fungal diversity and the bacterial and fungal species richness in the samples. The results also showed that the microbial community was significantly different in samples of different origin and the difference in the microbial community at the genus level was greater than at phylum level. Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%. Four bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aerococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jeotgalicoccus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Qingyang, while another four (&lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aneurinibacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Longnan. Two dominant fungal genera (&lt;i&gt;Pichia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;) were shared by the two samples. Additionally, two genera (&lt;i&gt;Rhodosporidium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in samples from Longnan. The functional genes of the bacteria present in samples indicated that a significant difference was observed in the bacterial community between samples of different origin. We also found that microbial interactions between bacterial and fungal communities in the samples were very complex. This study provides previously unknown information regarding the impact of the environment on microbial communities in douchi and lays a foundation for further investigations into food ecology in bacterial douchi.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Weibing Zhang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194876</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d7:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>d4c763b3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Weibing Zhang, Qiaoqiao Luo, Yan Zhu, Jiang Ma, Lei Cao, Min Yang, Pencheng Wen, Zhongmin Zhang, Xiaoling He&lt;/p&gt;

Two dominant bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ignatzschineria&lt;/i&gt;) were common to the two samples, both of which had a relative abundance of more than 1%. Four bacterial genera (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aerococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Geobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Jeotgalicoccus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Qingyang, while another four (&lt;i&gt;Carnobacterium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aneurinibacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in the sample from Longnan. Two dominant fungal genera (&lt;i&gt;Pichia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;) were shared by the two samples. Additionally, two genera (&lt;i&gt;Rhodosporidium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Yarrowia&lt;/i&gt;) were dominant only in samples from Longnan. The functional genes of the bacteria present in samples indicated that a significant difference was observed in the bacterial community between samples of different origin. We also found that microbial interactions between bacterial and fungal communities in the samples were very complex. This study provides previously unknown information regarding the impact of the environment on microbial communities in douchi and lays a foundation for further investigations into food ecology in bacterial douchi.</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Microbial diversity in two traditional bacterial douchi from Gansu province in northwest China using Illumina sequencing</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</link><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522345097000</published><author><name>Vignieri, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.9.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c79:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>d2c18f6b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Ecology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Resistance is not futile</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195322</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Deborah A.

We aimed to determine the effects of levodopa medication on the performance of a repetitive pointing task while standing, and to investigate the optimal trial duration in individuals with Parkinson’s disease, and older adults. Seventeen individuals with Parkinson’s disease (5 freezers) and 9 older adults stood on force platforms for 30 s and 120 s while performing a bilateral repetitive pointing task, tracked by motion capture. Participants with Parkinson’s disease were assessed on and off medication and older adults were also assessed on separate days. The main findings were that: 1) on medication, participants with Parkinson’s exhibited greater center of pressure root mean square in the medial-lateral direction, greater velocity in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions, and greater range in the medial-lateral direction than off medication; 2) longer trial durations resulted in greater center of pressure range in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions and greater coefficient of variation in finger pointing on the least affected side; 3) Parkinson’s participants exhibited larger range in the medial-lateral direction compared to older adults; 4) off medication, freezers presented with less range and root mean square in the anterior-posterior direction than non-freezers; and 5) a correlation emerged between the freezing of gait questionnaire and pointing asymmetry and the coefficient of variation of pointing on the most affected side. Therefore, Parkinson’s medication may increase instability during a repetitive pointing task. Longer trials may provide a better depiction of sway by discriminating between those with and without neurological impairment. Individuals with Parkinson’s were less stable than older adults, supporting that they are at a greater risk for falls. The greater restrictive postural strategy in freezers compared to non-freezers is likely a factor that augments fall-risk. Lastly, the link between freezing of gait and upper-limb movement indicates that freezing may manifest first in the lower-limbs.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Deborah A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Volodymyr Gerzanich</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195526</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ec9:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><fingerprint>c656222e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) impair the physical and mental status. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive ability of several cardiovascular biomarkers for identifying the incidence of disability as future recipients of public long-term care (LTC) service.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The subjects of this study were community-dwelling elderly individuals ≥ 65 years of age without a history of CVD (n = 5,755; mean age, 71 years). The endpoint of this study was official certification as a recipient of LTC. The cohort was divided into quartiles (Qs) based on the levels of three CVD biomarkers: the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concentration (BNP), and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (hsCRP). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the multi-adjusted relative hazard ratios (HRs) for incident LTC among the quartiles of each biomarker.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up (mean 5.6 years), 710 subjects were authorized as recipients of LTC. The HR was only significantly increased in the higher Qs of UACR (Q3, p &amp;lt; 0.01; Q4, p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, other biomarkers were not significantly associated with the endpoint. The risk predictive performance for the incidence of LTC as evaluated by an essential model (i.e. age- and sex-adjusted) was significantly improved by incorporating the UACR (net reclassification improvement = 0.084, p &amp;lt; 0.01; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.0018, p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that an increased UACR is useful for predicting physical and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly general population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Shuko Takahashi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195013</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca4253:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>e7c5a7d5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuko Takahashi, Fumitaka Tanaka, Yuki Yonekura, Kozo Tanno, Masaki Ohsawa, Kiyomi Sakata, Makoto Koshiyama, Akira Okayama, Motoyuki Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

The risk predictive performance for the incidence of LTC as evaluated by an essential model (i.e. age- and sex-adjusted) was significantly improved by incorporating the UACR (net reclassification improvement = 0.084, p &amp;lt; 0.01; integrated discrimination improvement = 0.0018, p &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that an increased UACR is useful for predicting physical and cognitive dysfunction in an elderly general population.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>The urine albumin-creatinine ratio is a predictor for incident long-term care in a general population</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20301-8</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20301-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/mGKs073bby8/s41598-018-20301-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20301-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-20301-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mGKs073bby8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>651</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-20301-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_20301_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Tuerhongjiang Tuxun</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20301-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1621edc4317:2f2f57:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1520936174359</crawled><fingerprint>30785e01</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20301-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-20301-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mGKs073bby8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1520924400000</published><title>Plasma IL-23 and IL-5 as surrogate markers of lesion metabolic activity in patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03344-3</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03344-3</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/IGE0GhHRhBM/s41467-018-03344-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Archimedes’ law explains penetration of solids into granular media&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archimedes’ law explains penetration of solids into granular media, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03344-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03344-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The penetration dynamics of solid objects into granular media has been described by theories that are constrained to the use of phenomenological models or empirical parameters.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003904</href></item></canonical><engagement>57</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003904</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162688d21d0:4b9326:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522172502480</crawled><fingerprint>9e299804</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

It can automatically detect adapters for single-end and paired-end FASTQ data. This tool is developed in C++ and has multithreading support.

major challenge in synthetic biology, particularly for mammalian systems, is

Control at the transcriptional level can be achieved by adaptation of bacterial
repressor-operator systems (e.g. TetR), but altering the activity of a protein
by controlling transcription is indirect and for longer half-life mRNAs,
decreasing activity this way can be inconveniently slow. Where possible, direct
modulation of protein activity by soluble ligands has many advantages,

have uncovered detailed information on the interactions between large numbers
of small molecules and their primary protein targets (as well as off-target

resource for synthetic biology. Here we present SynPharm, a tool that draws
together information from the pharmacological database GtoPdb and the
structural database, PDB, to help synthetic biologists identify ligand-binding
domains of natural proteins. Consequently, as sequence cassettes, these may be
suitable for building into engineered proteins to confer small molecule
modulation on them. The tool has ancillary utilities which
include; assessing contact changes between different ligands in the same
protein, predicting possible effects of genetic variants on binding residues
and insights into ligand cross-reactivity between species.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>A

modulation on them. The tool has ancillary utilities which
include; assessing contact changes between different ligands in the same
protein, predicting possible effects of genetic variants on binding residues
and insights into ligand cross-reactivity between species.</content></summary><title>An open-access tool for designing drug control into engineered  proteins</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03850-4</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03850-4</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/Fs2FPl_bavA/s41467-018-03850-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rice auxin influx carrier &lt;i&gt;OsAUX1&lt;/i&gt; facilitates root hair elongation in response to low external phosphate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice auxin influx carrier &amp;lt;i&gt;OsAUX1&amp;lt;/i&gt; facilitates root hair elongation in response to low external phosphate, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03850-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03850-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Plant root architecture can adapt to different nutrient conditions in the soil.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las titer in the psyllids and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

Finally, we apply SVCA to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, where we identify molecular pathways that are linked to cell-cell interactions.</description><published>1521702000000</published><title>Modelling cell-cell interactions from spatial molecular data with spatial variance component analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

We investigated how visual and kinaesthetic/efferent information is integrated for speed perception in running. Twelve moderately trained to trained subjects ran on a treadmill at three different speeds (8, 10, 12 km/h) in front of a moving virtual scene. They were asked to match the visual speed of the scene to their running speed–i.e., treadmill’s speed. For each trial, participants indicated whether the scene was moving slower or faster than they were running. Visual speed was adjusted according to their response using a staircase until the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) was reached, i.e., until visual and running speed were perceived as equivalent. For all three running speeds, participants systematically underestimated the visual speed relative to their actual running speed. Indeed, the speed of the visual scene had to exceed the actual running speed in order to be perceived as equivalent to the treadmill speed. The underestimation of visual speed was speed-dependent, and percentage of underestimation relative to running speed ranged from 15% at 8km/h to 31% at 12km/h. We suggest that this fact should be taken into consideration to improve the design of attractive treadmill-mediated virtual environments enhancing engagement into physical activity for healthier lifestyles and disease prevention and care.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Martina Caramenti</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195781</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>7fb183c6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Caramenti, Claudio L.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Elisabetta Liverani</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fe:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>386aa806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

In this paper, a wide-band low cross polarization antenna with a structure of microstrip line coupling to slot line as the balun is proposed. The radiation part of the antenna is fed by two pairs of parallel transmission line via a transition from a slot line which is coupled by a microstrip line. Because it is fed by parallel transmission lines, which is balanced-fed structure, the antenna can achieve an improved low cross-polarization performance. The height of the antenna is 0.146λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the wavelength of lowest frequency). The prototype antenna demonstrates a measured impedance bandwidth of 93.5% (2.7–7.44 GHz), a 3-dB-gain bandwidth of 77% (2.7–6.1 GHz), and a maximum gain of 10.5 dBi at 4.5 GHz.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Kai Sun</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194181</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e0d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>360f64b8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kai Sun, Deqiang Yang, Sihao Liu, Tianming Yang&lt;/p&gt;

The prototype antenna demonstrates a measured impedance bandwidth of 93.5% (2.7–7.44 GHz), a 3-dB-gain bandwidth of 77% (2.7–6.1 GHz), and a maximum gain of 10.5 dBi at 4.5 GHz.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>A broadband and low cross polarization antenna with a balun of microstrip line coupling to slot line</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24418-8</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24418-8</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/MxqSdNs6fJ0/s41598-018-24418-8</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24418-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24418-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MxqSdNs6fJ0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>361</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24418-8/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24418_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Youness Azimzade</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24418-8</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162be4edf85:14743a2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523611262853</crawled><fingerprint>ac169401</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24418-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24418-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MxqSdNs6fJ0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>Role of the Interplay Between the Internal and External Conditions in Invasive Behavior of Tumors</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019890?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019890?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019890?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522134609000</published><author><name>Barry M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value &amp;lt; 0.01 (ROC values &gt; 0.75 or &amp;lt; 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Makan Golizeh</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76922:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>441554e2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Makan Golizeh, Carlos E.

Open-cut coal mining in Queensland results in the formation of extensive saline overburden spoil-piles with steep slopes at the angle of repose (approximately 75% or 37&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;). These spoil-piles are generally found in multiple rows, several kilometers in length and heights of up to 50 or 60 m above the original landscape. They are highly dispersive and erodible. Legislation demands that these spoil piles be rehabilitated to minimize on-site and off-site discharges of sediment and salt into the surrounding environment. To achieve this, the steep slopes must be reduced, stabilized against erosion, covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. Key design criteria (slope gradient, slope length and vegetation cover) are required for the construction of post-mining landscapes that will result in acceptable erosion rates.
A novel user-friendly hillslope computer model MINErosion 3.4 was developed that can accurately predict potential erosion rates from field scale hillslopes using parameters measured with a 3m laboratory tilting flume-rainfall simulator or using routinely measured soil physical and chemical properties. This model links MINErosion 2 with a novel consolidation and above ground vegetation cover factors, to the RUSLE and MUSLE equations to predict the mean annual and storm event erosion rates. The RUSLE-based prediction of the mean annual erosion rates allow minesites to derive the key design criteria of slope length, slope gradient and vegetation cover that would lead to acceptable erosion rates. The MUSLE-based prediction of storm event erosion rates will be useful as input into risk analysis of potential damage from erosion.
MINErosion 3.4 was validated against erosion measured on 20 m field erosion plots established on post-mining landscapes at the Oakey Creek and Curragh coalmines, as well as on 120 and 70 m erosion plots on postmining landscapes at Kidston Gold Mine.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Hwat Bing So</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194230</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad2817:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>929e6cd3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hwat Bing So, Ashraf M.

The impact of agricultural practices and soil management on the communities of arthropods living in the agricultural landscape is acknowledged as a critical issue by the literature, and it needs to be better investigated to improve the ecological sustainability of agriculture. In the present study, we aimed to study how soil management affect carabid species distribution in one of the most typical agroecosystem of the Mediterranean region, i.e. the olive grove. In South Italy olive plantations feature different types of soil management, from tillage to half- or full-cover cropping. Species distribution has been examined for a total of 10,189 individuals and 62 species collected from 17 sites. Notably from our analysis we have observed that three factors (climax vegetation, soil features and soil management) explained half of the data variability. The composition of species groupings mirrors both bioclimatic conditions (climax vegetation) and soil features, especially watering, while soil management affects the species distribution, with different intensity from site to site. Eleven species have been recognized as the most abundant in the different facets of the studied olive groves and consequently designated as characteristics of the olive agroecosystem. The species traits of the sampled species have been weighted for a compelling evaluation of the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, showing uniform traits distribution when coping with the ecological factors that characterize the different plantation facets. We have found that carabid beetles can be used as model organisms for studying the effects of agricultural practices. Our study suggests that the interaction of man-induced trasformation with the natural background of the olive agroecosystem may be difficult to disentangle, so that such complexity must be taken into account when carabid beetles are expected to provide an ecosystem service for good agricultural practices.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Roberto Pizzolotto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194551</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37b1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>ee6e2a3c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto Pizzolotto, Antonio Mazzei, Teresa Bonacci, Stefano Scalercio, Nino Iannotta, Pietro Brandmayr&lt;/p&gt;

In summary, these results provide unique insights into the functioning of feedback-based counting mechanisms, and apply to organisms ranging from unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes to human cells.</description><published>1522479600000</published><title>Optimal feedback mechanisms for regulating cell numbers [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25216?af=R</originId><published>1522275167044</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25216?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25216?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/13&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, Page i-i, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626eabab44:6e14b09:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522275167044</crawled><fingerprint>ba711024</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 13, Page i-i, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 13, Page i-i, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Cover Image, Volume 39, Issue 13</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</originId><author><name>Javier A.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</href></item></canonical><engagement>5</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903d:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><fingerprint>a3308d99</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier A.

Understanding maternity roost requirements is fundamental to guide timber production forest management given such roosts are vital to sustain bat populations. We tracked lactating females of three tree cavity-roosting species: Gould&apos;s long-eared bat (&lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 7), eastern broad-nosed bat (&lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 6) and little forest bat (&lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;) (n = 25), over five weeks in young (predominately &amp;lt;5years old) forest regenerating from heavy timber harvest in southeast Australia. We aimed to investigate interspecific maternity roost selection in a regenerating landscape and by doing so, increase our understanding of the three species’ roost ecology. Sixteen &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and six &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orion&lt;/i&gt; unique maternity roost trees were located. Bats displayed a degree of maternity roost selection plasticity, however, interspecific differences were found. &lt;i&gt;Nyctophilus gouldi&lt;/i&gt; roosted selectively in retained riparian buffers, in trees of high senescence and switched roosts every day. &lt;i&gt;Vespadelus vulturnus&lt;/i&gt; roosted in logged areas and displayed high roost site fidelity, with one roost used for 33 consecutive days. &lt;i&gt;Scotorepens orion&lt;/i&gt; selected large live trees of low senescence. The preliminary data for this species suggests that females roost most days in ‘primary’ roosts but display a roost switching behaviour conforming to the fission-fusion model. Dead trees were identified to be important for both &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gouldi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vulturnus&lt;/i&gt;. Historical and recent logging at our study area drastically reduced cavity-bearing tree density to 1.4 trees per hectare in the logging zones (outside of exclusion areas), potentially limiting local populations of tree cavity-roosting bats and other cavity-dependent wildlife. Our data demonstrate that forest management must consider a range of maternity roost requirements to accommodate differences among species and highlight the importance of exclusion areas for roost habitat. We propose that an expanded ‘retention forestry’ approach should be implemented in logged areas that includes in-perpetuity forest patch retention to increase habitat complexity and continuity.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Niels Rueegger</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194429</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a61e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>38d9d976</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Niels Rueegger, Brad Law, Ross Goldingay&lt;/p&gt;

On the other hand, our proposed method, summary statistic imputation without performing variance re-weighting, fully accounts for imputation uncertainty while achieving better power.</description><published>1522479600000</published><title>A unifying framework for summary statistic imputation [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/CeZyQEHdPDo/s41598-018-23329-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &amp;lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&amp;lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23329-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/CeZyQEHdPDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>Wenhong Li</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1623d579f75:24a07a8:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521447575413</crawled><fingerprint>bc94a10a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &amp;lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&amp;lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &amp;lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 19 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23329-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23329-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of &lt;i&gt;Plutella xylostella&lt;/i&gt;, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus mundtii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/CeZyQEHdPDo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521442800000</published><title>Author Correction: Midgut bacteria in deltamethrin-resistant, deltamethrin-susceptible, and field-caught populations of Plutella xylostella, and phenomics of the predominant midgut bacterium Enterococcus mundtii</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3782.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3782.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3782.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Lithium (Li) isotope analyses of sedimentary rocks from the Meishan section in South China reveal extremely light seawater Li isotopic signatures at the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB), which coincide with the most severe mass extinction in the history of animal life.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Cheng-Te Chen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193936</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087d9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>cdb72b1d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Te Chen, Yu-Lan Chen, Yu-Ching Lin, Ching-Lin Hsieh, Jeng-Yi Tzeng, Kuan-Lin Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521666000000</published><title>Item-saving assessment of self-care performance in children with developmental disabilities: A prospective caregiver-report computerized adaptive test</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2952.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2952.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2952.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Obtaining grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is increasingly competitive, as funding success rates have declined over the past decade.

We retrospectively evaluated the effectiveness of combined use of salivary gland ultrasonography (US) and the 2016 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatic Disease (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for improving the diagnostic efficiency in patients with Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). A US-based salivary gland disease grading system was developed using a cohort comprising 213 SS or non-SS patients who fulfilled the minimum requirements for classifying SS based on the American-European Consensus Group (AECG) and ACR criteria. Using 62 SS or non-SS patients from the 213 patients and who had also undergone all the 5 examinations needed for the ACR/EULAR classification, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of various combinations of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications for diagnosing SS, using the clinical diagnosis of SS by rheumatologists as the gold standard. The ACR/EULAR criteria discriminated clinical SS patients with 77% and 79% accuracy for those with primary or secondary SS and for those with primary SS, respectively. However, the integrated score system of the ACR/EULAR and US classifications yielded 92% and 93% accuracy for these 2 SS patient groups, respectively, provided that US score of 3 was assigned to patients with US grade ≥2, and then patients with integrated threshold score of ≥5 were diagnosed as SS. Cross-validation also indicated improved accuracy of the integrated ACR/EULAR and US score system (91.9 and 93.0% for primary/secondary and primary SS patients, respectively) over that by the ACR/EULAR criteria alone. (74.2 and 86.0%, respectively).

The relationships of the monogeneric family Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 (Coleoptera: Elateroidea) have remained contentious due to its modified morphology, incorrect information on incomplete metamorphosis of females and the absence of molecular data. We produced the sequences for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;angulosus&lt;/i&gt; (Germar, 1844) (the type-species of &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852) and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to estimate its position. The analyses of Elateroidea (186 spp.) and Elateridae (110 spp.) molecular datasets of two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments repeatedly placed &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852 in relationships with the elaterid genera &lt;i&gt;Oxynopterus&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842 and &lt;i&gt;Pectocera&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842. Alternative topologies were rejected by likelihood tests. Therefore, Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 are down-ranked to the subfamily Plastocerinae in Elateridae Leach, 1815. We suggest that the morphology-based placement and high rank for some elateroid lineages were inferred from the presence of homoplasies which evolved due to incomplete sclerotization. Distantly related soft-bodied elateroids share freely movable and transverse coxae, a shortened prosternum, and a weakly sclerotized abdomen with free ventrites. Importantly, the apomorphic structures characteristic for their closest relatives, such as the prosternal process, mesoventral cavity, and intercoxal keel in the first abdominal ventrite are regularly absent. Consequently, morphology-based phylogenetic analyses suggest deeply rooted positions for lineages without expressed apomorphic character states. Molecular data represent an independent character system that is not affected by the convergent morphological evolution, and therefore molecular phylogenies can elucidate the relationships of incompletely sclerotized lineages.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Ladislav Bocak</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194026</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fe:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>d0af45d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislav Bocak, Michal Motyka, Matej Bocek, Milada Bocakova&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial architecture of signaling pathways and the interaction with cell size and morphology are complex, but little understood. With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology, it becomes crucial to understand intracellular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We suggest an estimate of average concentration for arbitrary cell shapes depending on the cell volume and cell surface area. The normalized variance, known from image analysis, is suggested as an alternative measure to quantify the deviation from the average concentration. A mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space is presented, providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. Quantification of signaling time scales reveals that signal propagation is faster at the membrane than at the nucleus, while this time difference decreases with the number of signaling components in the cytosol. Our investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades with feedback and asymmetric cell shapes. We conclude that intracellular signal propagation is highly dependent on cell geometry and, thereby, conveys information on cell size and shape to the nucleus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dutkoudOSkg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006075</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162ab8d3c72:d9a76:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523296582770</crawled><fingerprint>55f062a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wolfgang Giese, Gregor Milicic, Andreas Schröder, Edda Klipp&lt;/p&gt;

The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), also called the GABAergic tail of the ventral tegmental area, projects to the midbrain dopaminergic system, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and other regions. Whether the RMTg is involved in sleep–wake regulation is unknown. In the present study, pharmacogenetic activation of rat RMTg neurons promoted non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep with increased slow-wave activity (SWA). Conversely, rats after neurotoxic lesions of 8 or 16 days showed decreased NREM sleep with reduced SWA at lights on, which persisted until after lesions of 25 days. Similarly, pharmacological and pharmacogenetic inactivation of rat RMTg neurons decreased NREM sleep. Electrophysiological experiments combined with optogenetics showed a direct inhibitory connection between the terminals of RMTg neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The bidirectional effects of the RMTg on the sleep–wake cycle were mimicked by the modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neuronal activity using a pharmacogenetic approach. Furthermore, during the 2-hour recovery period following 6-hour sleep deprivation, the amount of NREM sleep in both the lesion and control rats was significantly increased compared with baseline levels; however, only the control rats showed a significant increase in SWA compared with baseline levels. Collectively, our findings reveal an essential role of the RMTg in the promotion of NREM sleep and homeostatic regulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oTjEGC4Ged0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002909</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002909</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48a:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523642710008</crawled><fingerprint>6f4b452d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Su-Rong Yang, Zhen-Zhen Hu, Yan-Jia Luo, Ya-Nan Zhao, Huan-Xin Sun, Dou Yin, Chen-Yao Wang, Yu-Dong Yan, Dian-Ru Wang, Xiang-Shan Yuan, Chen-Bo Ye, Wei Guo, Wei-Min Qu, Yoan Cherasse, Michael Lazarus, Yu-Qiang Ding, Zhi-Li Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Betânia M.

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Toshihito Fujii</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>f8b07d22</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toshihito Fujii, Keisho Hirota, Akihiro Yasoda, Akiko Takizawa, Naomi Morozumi, Ryuichi Nakamura, Takafumi Yotsumoto, Eri Kondo, Yui Yamashita, Yoriko Sakane, Yugo Kanai, Yohei Ueda, Ichiro Yamauchi, Shigeki Yamanaka, Kazumasa Nakao, Koichiro Kuwahara, Toshimasa Jindo, Mayumi Furuya, Tomoji Mashimo, Nobuya Inagaki, Tadao Serikawa, Kazuwa Nakao&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; is an important genus of legume plants and an herbage with excellent nitrogen fixation; it can tolerate extreme environmental conditions and possesses important medicinal value. However, there is limited genetic information about the genus; thus, we analysed four chloroplast loci (&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L, &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H and &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F) and one nuclear region (ITS) to determine the genetic diversity of 199 accessions from 18 &lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; species. The &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L and &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K sequences were highly conserved, whereas the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F and ITS sequences contained variable and parsimony-informative sites. In our analyses of the single and combined regions, we calculated the pairwise distance, haplotype and nucleotide diversity and gaps and then constructed phylogenetic trees to assess the genetic diversity, and our results revealed significant variations among the different accessions. The genetic distance values were between zero and nine, and based on the combined regions, the highest frequency value was approximately four. &lt;i&gt;Melilotus&lt;/i&gt; showed high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, particularly in the ITS sequences, with values of 0.86 and 0.0087, respectively. The single ITS sequence, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H, and the combined &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K+&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L+&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F (MRT) and &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K+&lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L+&lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H+&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L-F+ITS (MRPTI) regions showed interspecific variation in the gap analysis. Phylogenetic trees calculated using ITS, &lt;i&gt;psb&lt;/i&gt;A-&lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;H and MRPTI sequences indicated distinct genetic relationship in 18 species, and these species could be divided into two groups.

The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training.

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Marloes Vissers</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c4a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

Patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) can have extrahepatic manifestations. However, data about cardiac involvement of PBC is limited. We aimed in this study to analyze the clinical characteristics in patients with PBC complicated with and without cardiac involvement, and the risk factors of cardiac involvement in PBC. PBC patients admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2002 and February 2016 were consecutively enrolled. Structured interview, systemic rheumatologic examination, and laboratory tests were conducted for each patient, and risk factors of cardiac involvement were analyzed by comparing patients with and without cardiac involvement. In total, 580 PBC patients were enrolled, and cardiac involvement was identified in 24 patients (4%), with 11 male (46%) and a mean age of 57±8 year. Cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias were presented in 17 (70.8%) and 21 (87.5%) patients, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement were more frequently male (46% vs. 11%, P&amp;lt;0.01), complicated with inflammatory myopathy (IM) (58% vs. 1%, P&amp;lt;0.01), and had a longer disease course (median, 72 vs 24 month, P&amp;lt;0.01). Furthermore, concomitant IM was the independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC (OR = 77.333, 95% CI: 23.704–252.294). Cardiac involvement was a rare complication of PBC, which was more frequently observed in male or long-course patients. Importantly, concomitant IM was the strong independent risk factor of cardiac involvement in PBC. Given cardiac involvement is a serious complication, thorough evaluation of cardiac manifestation in high-risk PBC patients is highly recommended.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Sainan Bian</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194397</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e1d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>754a3bfe</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sainan Bian, Hua Chen, Li Wang, Yunyun Fei, Yunjiao Yang, Linyi Peng, Yongzhe Li, Fengchun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups.

Terrestrial arthropods play an important role in saltmarsh ecosystems, mainly affecting the saltmarsh’s primary production as the main consumers of terrestrial primary production and decomposition. Some of these arthropods, including selected insects and spiders, can be used as ecological indicators of overall marsh environmental health, as they are differentially sensitive to ecological stressors, such as land loss, erosion, oil spills, and tropical storms. In the present study, we used terrestrial arthropods collected from seven (three lightly-oiled, four heavily-oiled) sites in Barataria Bay and from three unoiled reference sites in Delacroix, Louisiana, to determine the impacts of the distribution and re-distribution of &lt;i&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/i&gt; (DWH) oil on these saltmarsh ecosystems. A total of 9,476 and 12,256 insects were collected in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The results show that the terrestrial arthropods were negatively affected by the re-distribution of DWH oil by Hurricane Isaac in 2012, although the level of impacts varied among the arthropod groups. Moreover, the mean diversity index was higher (&gt;1.5) in 2014 than in 2013 (&amp;lt;1.5) for all sites, suggesting a recovery trajectory of the saltmarsh arthropod population. The higher taxonomic richness observed in the reference sites compared to the oiled sites for both years also indicated long-term impacts of DWH oil to the saltmarsh arthropod community. Whereas a slow recovery of certain terrestrial arthropods was observed, long-term monitoring of arthropod communities would help better understand the recovery and succession of the marsh ecosystems.</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Coupled effects of oil spill and hurricane on saltmarsh terrestrial arthropods</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;
Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005985</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b6:a077e55f</id><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><fingerprint>f0df1a15</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

By killing cattle and otherwise complicating management, the many species of larkspur (&lt;i&gt;Delphinium&lt;/i&gt; spp.) present a serious, intractable, and complex challenge to livestock grazing management in the western United States. Among the many obstacles to improving our understanding of cattle-larkspur dynamics has been the difficulty of testing different grazing management strategies in the field, as the risk of dead animals is too great. Agent-based models (ABMs) provide an effective method of testing alternate management strategies without risk to livestock. ABMs are especially useful for modeling complex systems such as livestock grazing management, and allow for realistic bottom-up encoding of cattle behavior. Here, we introduce a spatially-explicit, behavior-based ABM of cattle grazing in a pasture with a dangerous amount of Geyer’s larkspur (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;geyeri&lt;/i&gt;). This model tests the role of herd cohesion and stocking density in larkspur intake, finds that both are key drivers of larkspur-induced toxicosis, and indicates that alteration of these factors within realistic bounds can mitigate risk. Crucially, the model points to herd cohesion, which has received little attention in the discipline, as playing an important role in lethal acute toxicosis. As the first ABM to model grazing behavior at realistic scales, this study also demonstrates the tremendous potential of ABMs to illuminate grazing management dynamics, including fundamental aspects of livestock behavior amidst ecological heterogeneity.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Kevin E.

A few colors, such as red and yellow, are commonly found in aposematic (warning) signaling across taxa, independent of evolutionary relationships. These colors have unique traits (i.e., hue, brightness) that aid in their differentiation, and perhaps, their effectiveness in promoting avoidance learning. This repeated use calls into question the influence of selection on specific warning colors adopted by aposematic prey-predator systems. To disentangle the influence of color characteristics on this process, we trained week-old chickens (&lt;i&gt;Gallus gallus domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) to learn to avoid distasteful food that was associated with one of three color signals (yellow, white, red) that varied in both hue and in brightness in order to assess which of these traits most influenced their ability to learn avoidance. Our results show that while chicks learned to avoid all three colors, avoidance was based on the hue, not brightness of the different signals. We found that yellow was the most effective for avoidance learning, followed by red, and finally white. Our results suggest that while these three colors are commonly used in aposematic signaling, predators’ ability to learn avoidance differs among them. These results may explain why yellow is among the most common signals across aposematic taxa.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>J. P.

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>According to this new survey, depression and anxiety are far more common among graduate students than in the general population.

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern.

This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><published>1522789200000</published><title>Spatial regularity control of phyllotaxis pattern generated by the mutual interaction between auxin and PIN1</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194612</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;
Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Ranjit Chauhan</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5e9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>d2096ec8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment, but limited studies focused on the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with hearing loss among adults of working age. This paper aimed to fill this gap among Chinese adults. We obtained data from Ear and Hearing Disorder Survey conducted in four provinces of China in 2014–2015. The survey was based on WHO Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and 25,860 adults aged 25 to 59 years were selected in this study. Trained local examiners performed pure tone audiometry to screen people with hearing loss, and those who were screened positively for hearing loss were referred to audiologists to make final diagnosis. SES was measured by occupation, education and income. Results show after adjusting for SES measures and covariates, in urban areas, compared with white-collar workers, blue-collar workers and the unemployed were more likely to have hearing loss, with an odds ratio of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.3) and 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.4), respectively. Compared with people with education of senior high school or above, those with junior high school, primary school and illiteracy had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.4, 1.8), 2.1(95%CI: 1.7, 2.5) and 2.6 (95%CI: 1.9, 3.7) times as likely to have hearing loss, respectively. In rural areas, the unemployed had 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0, 2.3) times the risk of hearing loss compared with white-collar workers, and illiterates had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.1) times the risk of hearing loss compared with people with education of senior high school or above, after SES variables and covariates were taken into considerations. Income was not significantly associated with hearing loss in urban and rural areas. In conclusion, SES, in the form of occupation and education, was associated with hearing loss among working-aged population, and further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of such association.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Ping He</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195227</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>c274997a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping He, Yanan Luo, Xiangyang Hu, Rui Gong, Xu Wen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis (SDS) is a protein separation technique widely used, for example, prior to immunoblotting. Samples are usually prepared in a buffer containing both high concentrations of reducers and high concentrations of SDS. This conjunction renders the samples incompatible with common protein assays. By chelating the SDS, cyclodextrins make the use of simple, dye-based colorimetric assays possible. In this paper, we describe the optimization of the assay, focussing on the cyclodextrin/SDS ratio and the use of commercial assay reagents. The adaptation of the assay to a microplate format and using other detergent-containing conventional extraction buffers is also described.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Thierry Rabilloud</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195755</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>60f68c6d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thierry Rabilloud&lt;/p&gt;

Next generation sequencing (NGS) is becoming increasingly integrated into oncological practice and clinical research. NGS methods have also provided evidence for clonal evolution of cancers during disease progression and treatment. The number of variants associated with response to specific therapeutic agents keeps increasing. However, the identification of novel driver mutations as opposed to passenger (phenotypically silent or clinically irrelevant) mutations remains a major challenge. We conducted targeted exome sequencing of advanced solid tumors from 44 pre-treated patients with solid tumors including breast, colorectal and lung carcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas and others. We catalogued established driver mutations and putative new drivers as predicted by two distinct algorithms. The established drivers we detected were consistent with published observations. However, we also detected a significant number of mutations with driver potential never described before in each tumor type we studied. These putative drivers belong to key cell fate regulatory networks, including potentially druggable pathways.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Jared A.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Douglas Sheridan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66da:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

Background &amp;amp; aims &lt;p&gt;To determine the prognostic potential of classic and novel serologic antibodies regarding unfavorable disease course in a prospective ulcerative colitis (UC) patient cohort, since few and conflicting data are available in the literature regarding this matter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;187 consecutive patients were studied prospectively (median follow-up: 135 months) from a single referral IBD center in Hungary. Sera were tested for different IgA/IgG type autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic [ANCA], anti-DNA-bound-lactoferrin [anti-LFS], anti-goblet cell [anti-GAB] and anti-pancreatic [PAB: anti-CUZD1 and anti-GP2)]) by indirect immunofluorescence technique and for anti-microbial (anti-&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; [ASCA] IgG/IgA and anti-OMP Plus&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; IgA) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 73.6%, 62.4% and 11.2% of UC patients were positive for IgA/IgG type of atypical perinuclear-ANCA, anti-LFS and anti-GAB, respectively. Occurrences of PABs were 9.6%, while ASCA IgA/IgG and anti-OMP IgA were 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Antibody status was stable over time. IgA type PABs were more prevalent in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (37.5% vs. 4.7% for anti-CUZD1 and 12.5% vs. 0% for anti-GP2, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; for both). IgA type ASCA and anti-CUZD1 antibodies were associated with higher risk of requirement for long-term immunosuppressant therapy in Kaplan-Meier analysis (pLogRank &lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt; for both). However, in multivariate Cox-regression analysis only ASCA IgA (HR: 2.74, 95%CI: 1.46–5.14, &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;01&lt;/i&gt;) remained independent predictor. UC-related hospitalization due to disease activity was only associated with multiple antibody positivity (for 3 or more; HR 2.03 [95% CI: 1.16–3.56]; p = 0.013). None of the individual antibodies or their combination was associated with the risk of development of extensive disease or colectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Even with low prevalence rates, present study gives further evidence to the role of certain antibodies as markers for distinct phenotype and disease outcome in UC.

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Takashi Ijiri</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66d3:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract &lt;p&gt;The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a species detection tool is attracting attention from both scientific and applied fields, especially for detecting invasive or rare species. In order to use eDNA as an efficient and reliable tool, however, we need to understand its origin and state as well as factors affecting its degradation. Various biotic and abiotic environmental factors have been proposed to affect degradation of eDNA in aquatic environments and thus to influence detection rates of species. Here, we were interested in two of them, namely UV light, which can break down DNA, and the presence of filter feeders, which can remove DNA and DNA-bound particles. A few, mostly laboratory-based studies have found minor effects of UVB on the degradation of eDNA. Ultraviolet A radiation (UVA), however, has been neglected although it also causes DNA lesions and is 10- to 100-fold more prevalent than UVB when reaching the earth’s surface. Filter feeders are common in aquatic ecosystem, but their effects on eDNA has hitherto been ignored. We conducted a full-factorial aquatic mesocosm experiment under near-natural outdoor conditions manipulating UV radiation as well as the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dreissena polymorpha&lt;/i&gt;, a strong filter feeder capable of filtering cells or organelles containing DNA. Surprisingly, we found that neither UV radiation nor the presence of the filter feeder affected eDNA-based detection rates of macroinvertebrates, even though the experiment took place in summer when UV radiation intensity and filtration activity is high for the chosen experimental site and conditions. These results, in combination with studies from marine or laboratory settings finding no effect of sunlight and its UV components on the detectability of eDNA, suggest that eDNA based species assessments could be relatively robust with respect to our two factors studied.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Elvira Mächler</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195529</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd082:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>e37a265a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elvira Mächler, Maslin Osathanunkul, Florian Altermatt&lt;/p&gt;

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization.

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Fabio Tramuto</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f6:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>b8c64933</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Disturbance of intestinal wound closure leads to insufficient anastomotic healing and is associated with considerable morbidity following colorectal resections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in regulation of wound closure. Here fluorescence endoscopy was evaluated for assessment of MMP-2/-9 expression during failed intestinal anastomotic healing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Distal colonic anastomoses were performed as a model for disturbed healing in 36 Balb/c mice. Healing was evaluated endoscopically, macroscopically, and histologically after 1, 3 and 5 days. For detection of MMP-2/-9 expression fluorescence endoscopy (FE) was used following &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;administration of a Cy5.5-labeled MMP-2/-9 specific tracer. FE was complemented by quantification of the fluorescence signal using the MS-FX PRO Optical Imaging System. An overall leakage score was calculated and correlated with the results of FE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;With increasing incidence of anastomotic leakage from POD1 (17%) to POD5 (83%) the uptake of the MMP tracer gradually increased (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), POD1: 17.91 ± 1.251 vs. POD3: 30.56 ± 3.03 vs. POD5: 44.8 ± 4.473, P&amp;lt;0.0001). Mice with defective anastomotic healing showed significantly higher uptake compared to non-defective (SNR: 37.37± 3.63 vs. 26.16± 3.635, P = 0.0369). White light endoscopy and FE allowed evaluation of anastomotic healing and visualization of mucosal MMPs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using FE based detection of MMPs in the anastomosis, an overall positive predictive value of 71.4% and negative predictive value of 66.6% was calculated for detection of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;During disturbed anastomotic healing increased expression of MMP-2/-9 was observed in the anastomotic tissue.

LdtR is a master regulator of gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, one of the causative agents of citrus greening disease. LdtR belongs to the MarR-family of transcriptional regulators and it has been linked to the regulation of more than 180 genes in &lt;i&gt;Liberibacter&lt;/i&gt; species, most of them gathered in the following Clusters of Orthologous Groups: cell motility, cell wall envelope, energy production, and transcription. Our previous transcriptomic evidence suggested that LdtR is directly involved in the modulation of the zinc uptake system genes (&lt;i&gt;znu&lt;/i&gt;) in the closely related &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;crescens&lt;/i&gt;. In this report, we show that LdtR is involved in the regulation of one of the two encoded zinc uptake mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticus&lt;/i&gt;, named &lt;i&gt;znu&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To understand translational capacity on a genome-wide scale across three developmental stages of immature soybean seed cotyledons, ribosome profiling was performed in combination with RNA sequencing and cluster analysis. Transcripts representing 216 unique genes demonstrated a higher level of translational activity in at least one stage by exhibiting higher translational efficiencies (TEs) in which there were relatively more ribosome footprint sequence reads mapping to the transcript than were present in the control total RNA sample. The majority of these transcripts were more translationally active at the early stage of seed development and included 12 unique serine or cysteine proteases and 16 2S albumin and low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins that may serve as substrates for turnover and mobilization early in seed development. It would appear that the serine proteases and 2S albumins play a vital role in the early stages. In contrast, our investigation of profiles of 19 genes encoding high abundance seed storage proteins, such as glycinins, beta-conglycinins, lectin, and Kunitz trypsin inhibitors, showed that they all had similar patterns in which the TE values started at low levels and increased approximately 2 to 6-fold during development. The highest levels of these seed protein transcripts were found at the mid-developmental stage, whereas the highest ribosome footprint levels of only up to 1.6 TE were found at the late developmental stage. These experimental findings suggest that the major seed storage protein coding genes are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level during normal soybean cotyledon development. Finally, our analyses also identified a total of 370 unique gene models that showed very low TE values including over 48 genes encoding ribosomal family proteins and 95 gene models that are related to energy and photosynthetic functions, many of which have homology to the chloroplast genome. Additionally, we showed that genes of the chloroplast were relatively translationally inactive during seed development.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Md.

Oxytocin is a neurohypophysial peptide linked to a wide range of biological functions, including milk ejection, temperament and reproduction. Aims of the present study were a) the characterization of the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; (Oxytocin-neurophysin I) gene and its regulatory regions in Old and New world camelids; b) the investigation of the genetic diversity and the discovery of markers potentially affecting the gene regulation. On average, the gene extends over 814 bp, ranging between 825 bp in dromedary, 811 bp in Bactrian and 810 bp in llama and alpaca. Such difference in size is due to a duplication event of 21 bp in dromedary. The main regulatory elements, including the composite hormone response elements (CHREs), were identified in the promoter, whereas the presence of mature microRNAs binding sequences in the 3’UTR improves the knowledge on the factors putatively involved in the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation, although their specific biological effect needs to be still elucidated. The sequencing of genomic DNA allowed the identification of 17 intraspecific polymorphisms and 69 nucleotide differences among the four species. One of these (MF464535:g.622C&gt;G) is responsible, in alpaca, for the loss of a consensus sequence for the transcription factor SP1. Furthermore, the same SNP falls within a CpG island and it creates a new methylation site, thus opening future possibilities of investigation to verify the influence of the novel allelic variant in the &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation. A PCR-RFLP method was setup for the genotyping and the frequency of the allele C was 0.93 in a population of 71 alpacas. The obtained data clarify the structure of &lt;i&gt;OXT&lt;/i&gt; gene in domestic camelids and add knowledge to the genetic variability of a genomic region, which has received little investigation so far. These findings open the opportunity for new investigations, including association studies with productive and reproductive traits.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Alfredo Pauciullo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195407</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7693a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>17b8f840</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfredo Pauciullo, Danlami Moses Ogah, Marco Iannaccone, Georg Erhardt, Liliana Di Stasio, Gianfranco Cosenza&lt;/p&gt;

Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid signaling–dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently, Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino acid deprivation–induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tMWvVxdBQbk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005090</href></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005090</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:493921:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><fingerprint>4afaf308</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Weng, Yi-Peng Han, Atsushi Enomoto, Yasuyuki Kitaura, Shushi Nagamori, Yoshikatsu Kanai, Naoya Asai, Jian An, Maki Takagishi, Masato Asai, Shinji Mii, Takashi Masuko, Yoshiharu Shimomura, Masahide Takahashi&lt;/p&gt;

These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tMWvVxdBQbk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1521053823081</recrawled><published>1521061200000</published><title>Negative regulation of amino acid signaling by MAPK-regulated 4F2hc/Girdin complex</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-i?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/44-i?rss=1</link><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522950073000</published><author><name>Smith, H.
