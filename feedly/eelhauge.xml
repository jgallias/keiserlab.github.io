Due to low efficacy of classic antimicrobial drugs, finding new active preparations attracts much attention. In this study an innovative, cost-effective and environmentally friendly method was applied to produce silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using filamentous fungi &lt;i&gt;Metarhizium robertsii&lt;/i&gt; biomass waste. It was shown that these NPs possess prominent antifungal effects against &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glabrata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; reference strains. Further detailed studies were performed on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 90028. AgNPs kill curve (CFU method and esterase-mediated reduction of fluorescein diacetate); fractionally inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with fluconazole (FLC); effect on fungal cell membrane permeability (propidium iodide (PI) staining), membrane lipids profile (HPLC-MS), yeast morphotypes and intracellular reactive oxygen species level (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DCFDA probe) were investigated. Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm properties of AgNPs (alone and in combination with FLC) were also tested. Biosafety of AgNPs use was assessed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in cytotoxicity tests against L929 fibroblasts, pulmonary epithelial A549 cell line, and red blood cells. Significant reduction in the viability of yeast cells treated with AgNPs was shown within 6 h. The proportion of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; PI-positive cells increased in a dose and time-dependent manner. Changes in the qualitative and quantitative profile of cell membrane lipids, including significant decline in the quantity of most phospholipid species containing C18:2 and an increase in the amount of phospholipids containing C18:1 acyl species were observed after yeast exposure to AgNPs. CLSM images showed an enhancement in ROS intracellular accumulation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; treated with biogenic nanosilver. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albicans&lt;/i&gt; transformation from yeast to hyphal forms was also reduced. AgNPs decreased adhesion of yeast to abiotic surfaces, as well as acted synergistically with FLC against sessile population. At fungicidal and fungistatic concentrations, they were non-toxic to mammalian cells. Obtained results confirm suitability of our “green synthesis” method to produce AgNPs with therapeutic potential against fungal infections.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>73c71460</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Różalska, Beata Sadowska, Aleksandra Budzyńska, Przemysław Bernat, Sylwia Różalska&lt;/p&gt;

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>88d37bb1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Óscar M.

Devils Hole is the sole natural habitat of the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (&lt;i&gt;Cyprinodon diabolis&lt;/i&gt;). To establish a backup population, the Ash Meadows Fish Conservation Facility (AMFCF), a full-scale replica of the uppermost 6.7 m of Devils Hole, was constructed by management agencies in the mid-2010s. Despite rigorous efforts to mimic the bathymetric and physical details of the Devils Hole environment, the biogeochemistry and microbiology of the AMFCF refuge tank remain largely unaddressed. We evaluated water physicochemistry and employed Illumina DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries to evaluate planktonic and benthic bacterial and archaeal community composition within their respective physicochemical contexts in Devils Hole and AMFCF on the same day. Major ion concentrations were consistent between the two systems, but water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics differed. Bioavailable nitrogen (primarily nitrate) was 5x lower in AMFCF. Devils Hole and AMFCF nitrogen:phosphorus molar ratios were 107:1 and 22:1, indicative of different nutrient control mechanisms. Both sites are microbiologically diverse, with over 40 prokaryotic phyla represented at each, with 37 shared between them and nearly than half deriving from candidate divisions. The abundance and composition of predicted photosynthetic primary producers (Cyanobacteria) was markedly different between sites: Devils Hole planktonic and sediment communities were dominated by &lt;i&gt;Oscillatoria spp&lt;/i&gt;. (13.2% mean relative abundance), which proved virtually undetectable in AMFCF. Conversely, AMFCF was dominated by a predicted heterotroph from the Verrucomicrobiaceae family (31.7%); which was comparatively rare (&amp;lt;2.4%) in Devils Hole. We propose that the paucity of bioavailable nitrogen in AMFCF, perhaps resulting from physical isolation from allochthonous environmental inputs, is reflected in the microbial assemblage disparity, influences biogeochemical cycling of other dissolved constituents, and may ultimately impact survivorship and recruitment of refuge populations of the Devils Hole pupfish.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>436a1637</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joshua D.

Medulloblastoma (MB), the tumor of the cerebellum, is the most frequent brain cancer in childhood and a major cause of pediatric mortality. Based on gene profiling, four MB subgroups have been identified, i.e., Wnt or Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) types, and subgroup 3 or 4. The Shh-type MB has been shown to arise from the cerebellar precursors of granule neurons (GCPs), where a hyperactivation of the Shh pathway leads to their neoplastic transformation. We have previously shown that the gene &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PC3&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Btg2&lt;/i&gt;) inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation and migration of GCPs. Moreover, the overexpression or the deletion of &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, a model of spontaneous Shh-type MB, highly reduces or increases, respectively, the frequency of MB. Here we tested whether Tis21 can inhibit MB allografts. Athymic nude mice were subcutaneously grafted with MB cells explanted from &lt;i&gt;Patched1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice. MB allografts were then injected with adeno-associated viruses either carrying &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; (AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;) or empty (AAV-CBA). We observed that the treatment with AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; significantly inhibited the growth of tumor nodules, as judged by their volume, and reduced the number of proliferating tumor cells (labeled with Ki67 or BrdU), relative to AAV-CBA-treated control mice. In parallel, AAV-&lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; increased significantly tumor cells labeled with early and late neural differentiation markers. Overall the results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt;-gene therapy slows down MB tumor growth through inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neural differentiation. These results validate &lt;i&gt;Tis21&lt;/i&gt; as a relevant target for MB therapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>610466c5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dario Presutti, Manuela Ceccarelli, Laura Micheli, Giuliana Papoff, Simonetta Santini, Simone Samperna, Cristiana Lalli, Lorena Zentilin, Giovina Ruberti, Felice Tirone&lt;/p&gt;

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.
In &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, we could not observe any clear increasing or decreasing trends during the archaeological time periods, either for humans or for animals, which would have suggested significant changes in the environment and landscape use. We discovered sex-related dietary differences, with males of all archaeological periods having higher &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values than females, and an age-related increasing consumption of animal protein.

Recent studies have suggested that proficient bilinguals show morphological decomposition in the L2, but the question remains as to whether this process is modulated by the cognateness of the morphemic constituents of L2 words and by L2 proficiency. To answer this question was the main goal of the present research. For that purpose, a masked priming lexical decision task was conducted manipulating for the first time the degree of orthographic overlap of the L2 word as a whole, as well as of their morphemic constituents (bases and suffixes). Thirty-four European Portuguese-English bilinguals (16 intermediate and 18 high-proficient) and 16 English native-speaking controls performed the task in English. Results revealed that both groups of bilinguals decomposed words as the native control group. Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d671f977</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Montserrat Comesaña, Pauline Bertin, Helena Oliveira, Ana Paula Soares, Juan Andrés Hernández-Cabrera, Séverine Casalis&lt;/p&gt;

Importantly, results also showed that morphological priming effects were sensitive not only to cross-language similarities of words as a whole, but also to their morphemic constituents (especially, suffixes).</description><title>The impact of cognateness of word bases and suffixes on morpho-orthographic processing: A masked priming study with intermediate and high-proficiency Portuguese-English bilinguals</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a6b:7c9981b6</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193480</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193480</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1520888400000</published><author><name>Montserrat Comesaña</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1520876345325</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195412</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195412</originId><updated>1522875600000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dimitar Spirrov, Maaike Van Eeckhoutte, Lieselot Van Deun, Tom Francart&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;People who use a cochlear implant together with a contralateral hearing aid—so-called bimodal listeners—have poor localisation abilities and sounds are often not balanced in loudness across ears. In order to address the latter, a loudness balancing algorithm was created, which equalises the loudness growth functions for the two ears. The algorithm uses loudness models in order to continuously adjust the two signals to loudness targets. Previous tests demonstrated improved binaural balance, improved localisation, and better speech intelligibility in quiet for soft phonemes. In those studies, however, all stimuli were preprocessed so spontaneous head movements and individual head-related transfer functions were not taken into account. Furthermore, the hearing aid processing was linear.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In the present study, we simplified the acoustical loudness model and implemented the algorithm in a real-time system. We tested bimodal listeners on speech perception and on sound localisation, both in normal loudness growth configuration and in a configuration with a modified loudness growth function. We also used linear and compressive hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The comparison between the original acoustical loudness model and the new simplified model showed loudness differences below 3% for almost all tested speech-like stimuli and levels. We found no effect of balancing the loudness growth across ears for speech perception ability in quiet and in noise. We found some small improvements in localisation performance. Further investigation with a larger sample size is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>767bdbd6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dimitar Spirrov, Maaike Van Eeckhoutte, Lieselot Van Deun, Tom Francart&lt;/p&gt;

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity.

Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition.

Insulin is a vital part of diabetes treatment, whereas glucagon is primarily used to treat insulin-induced hypoglycemia. However, glucagon is suggested to have a central role in the regulation of body weight, which would be beneficial for diabetic patients. Since the glucagon effect on blood glucose is known to be transient, it is relevant to investigate the pharmacodynamics of glucagon after repeated dosing. In the present study, we used telemetry to continuously measure blood glucose in streptozotocin induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats. This allowed for a more detailed analysis of glucose regulation compared to intermittent blood sampling. In particular, we evaluated the blood glucose-lowering effect of different insulin doses alone, and in combination with a long acting glucagon analog (LAG). We showed how the effect of the LAG accumulated and persisted over time. Furthermore, we found that addition of the LAG decreased body weight without affecting food intake.
In a subsequent study, we focused on the glucagon effect on body weight and food intake during equal glycemic control. In order to obtain comparable maximum blood glucose lowering effect to insulin alone, the insulin dose had to be increased four times in combination with 1 nmol/kg of the LAG. In this set-up the LAG prevented further increase in body weight despite the four times higher insulin-dose. However, the body composition was changed. The insulin group increased both lean and fat mass, whereas the group receiving four times insulin in combination with the LAG only significantly increased the fat mass. No differences were observed in food intake, suggesting a direct effect on energy expenditure by glucagon. Surprisingly, we observed decreased levels of FGF21 in plasma compared to insulin treatment alone. With the combination of insulin and the LAG the blood glucose-lowering effect of insulin was prolonged, which could potentially be beneficial in diabetes treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7444c4b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christina Pedersen, Trine Porsgaard, Maria Thomsen, Mette Marie Rosenkilde, Nikolaj Kulahin Roed&lt;/p&gt;

Here the authors analyze circulating and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from 19 EOC patients and report frequent recovery of neo-antigen-reactive T cells from both compartments but with distinct TCR repertoires that have higher affinity in TILs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/4yzrKIsgvlU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Sensitive and frequent identification of high avidity neo-epitope specific CD8 + T cells in immunotherapy-naive ovarian cancer</title><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16229332b32:98b635:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03301-0</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/4yzrKIsgvlU/s41467-018-03301-0</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1521097200000</published><author><name>Sara Bobisse</name></author><unread>False</unread><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03301-0</href></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521109642034</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.9.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Ecology, Medicine, Diseases</item></keywords><title>Resistance is not futile</title><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>d2c18f6b</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c79:34f43e70</id><published>1522345097000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Vignieri, S.</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-i?rss=1</link><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522347550579</crawled></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24972?af=R</originId><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 13, Page 757-761, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>b4f572d5</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Volume 39, Issue 13, Page 757-761, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><title>Issue Information</title><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626eabab44:6e14b0a:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24972?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.24972?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><published>1522275167044</published><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/1096987x/39/13&quot;&gt;Volume 39, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, Page 757-761, May 15, 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522275167044</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</originId><updated>1521666000000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Delphine Grynberg, Belén López-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;
Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78). Afterwards, we assessed participants’ reports of avoidance and approach with regard to the character and their disposition to use maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that both PD and EC were positively related to maladaptive strategies and negatively related to adaptive strategies, and that the association between maladaptive regulation strategies (i.e., rumination) and the willingness to avoid the person in distress was mediated by reports of greater PD. This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a37b37d3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Delphine Grynberg, Belén López-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

We highlight the capability of the methods to pinpoint key elements related to cell function and cell development, conforming with biological knowledge and experimentally validated data, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a system&apos;s dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.</description><title>An Algorithmic Information Calculus for Causal Discovery and Reprogramming Systems [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162308dc6cb:1583832:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185637v13?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/185637v13?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><published>1521183600000</published><author><name>Zenil, H.</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521233020619</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>295b60f4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nm0418-526b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/rHJ2uFaIUnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Erratum: The molecular landscape of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia reveals recurrent structural alterations and age-specific mutational interactions</title><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_162b039947a:1dcc85e:923c4a60</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/rHJ2uFaIUnU/nm0418-526b</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1523343600000</published><author><name>Hamid Bolouri</name></author><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0418-526b</href></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523374986362</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01240</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.7b01240/20180316/images/medium/ct-2017-01240d_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01240&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

We present a computational model of spatial navigation comprising different learning mechanisms in mammals, i.e., associative, cognitive mapping and parallel systems. This model is able to reproduce a large number of experimental results in different variants of the Morris water maze task, including standard associative phenomena (spatial generalization gradient and blocking), as well as navigation based on cognitive mapping. Furthermore, we show that competitive and cooperative patterns between different navigation strategies in the model allow to explain previous apparently contradictory results supporting either associative or cognitive mechanisms for spatial learning. The key computational mechanism to reconcile experimental results showing different influences of distal and proximal cues on the behavior, different learning times, and different abilities of individuals to alternatively perform spatial and response strategies, relies in the dynamic coordination of navigation strategies, whose performance is evaluated online with a common currency through a modular approach. We provide a set of concrete experimental predictions to further test the computational model. Overall, this computational work sheds new light on inter-individual differences in navigation learning, and provides a formal and mechanistic approach to test various theories of spatial cognition in mammals.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ErL2lgBM7O0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>37c4f22b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laurent Dollé, Ricardo Chavarriaga, Agnès Guillot, Mehdi Khamassi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of learning and memory impairments remains a challenge. Recent investigations have shown that the activation of group I mGluRs (mGluR1 and mGluR5) in cultured hippocampal neurons by application of (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) causes the regulated internalization of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which subsequently activates protein kinase D1 (PKD1). Through phosphorylating the C-terminals of the NMDAR GluN2 subunits, PKD1 down-regulates the activity of remaining (non-internalized) surface NMDARs. The knockdown of PKD1 does not affect the DHPG-induced inhibition of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) but prevents the DHPG-induced inhibition of NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, we investigated the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effects of bilateral infusions of DHPG into the hippocampal CA1 area of rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) and the novel object discrimination (NOD) tests.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 300 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–280 g) were used for behavioral tests. One hundred ninety four were used in MWM test and the other 106 rats in the NOD test. Following one week of habituation to the vivarium, rats were bilaterally implanted under deep anesthesia with cannulas aimed at the CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1 coordinates in mm from Bregma: AP -3.14; lateral +/-2; DV -3.0). Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min). The effects of these infusions and the effects of PKD1 knockdown were examined in MWM or NOD test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;DHPG infusion increased the latency to reach the platform in the MWM test and reduced the preference for the novel object in the NOD task. We found that the DHPG effects were dose-dependent and could be maintained for up to 2 days. Notably, these effects could be prevented by pre-infusion of the group1 mGluR antagonist MPEP, the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673, or by PKD1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence that PKD1-mediated signaling may play a critical role in the induction of learning and memory impairments by DHPG infusion into the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6755c000</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Florian Duclot, Bradley R.

Through implanted cannulas artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), the group1 mGluR antagonist 6-Methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, or the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673 were infused into the bilateral hippocampal CA1 areas (2 μL per side, over 5 min). The effects of these infusions and the effects of PKD1 knockdown were examined in MWM or NOD test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;DHPG infusion increased the latency to reach the platform in the MWM test and reduced the preference for the novel object in the NOD task. We found that the DHPG effects were dose-dependent and could be maintained for up to 2 days. Notably, these effects could be prevented by pre-infusion of the group1 mGluR antagonist MPEP, the dynamin-dependent internalization inhibitor Dynasore, the PKD1 inhibitor CID755673, or by PKD1 knockdown in the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Altogether, these findings provide direct evidence that PKD1-mediated signaling may play a critical role in the induction of learning and memory impairments by DHPG infusion into the hippocampal CA1 area.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Hippocampal protein kinase D1 is necessary for DHPG-induced learning and memory impairments in rats</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f55:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195095</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195095</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522789200000</published><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522777331269</crawled></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25178?af=R</originId><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>bce4b96d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626543470b:6cdfb:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25178?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25178?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><published>1522117330699</published><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522117330699</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</originId><updated>1522443600000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frédéric Picard-Jean, Carolin Brand, Maude Tremblay-Létourneau, Andréa Allaire, Maxime C.

The 5&apos; RNA cap structure (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA) is a key feature of eukaryotic mRNAs with important roles in stability, splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA export, and translation. Higher eukaryotes can further modify this minimal cap structure with the addition of a methyl group on the ribose 2&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; position of the first transcribed nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA) and sometimes on the adjoining nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA). In higher eukaryotes, the DXO protein was previously shown to be responsible for both decapping and degradation of RNA transcripts harboring aberrant 5’ ends such as pRNA, pppRNA, GpppRNA, and surprisingly, &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA. It was proposed that the interaction of the cap binding complex with the methylated cap would prevent degradation of &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNAs by DXO. However, the critical role of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation found in higher eukaryotic cap structures was not previously addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that DXO possesses both decapping and exoribonuclease activities toward incompletely capped RNAs, only sparing RNAs with a 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated cap structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy assays also revealed that the presence of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation on the cap structure drastically reduces the affinity of DXO for RNA. Moreover, immunofluorescence and structure-function assays also revealed that a nuclear localisation signal is located in the amino-terminus region of DXO.

Vandetanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of various cancers, has been reported to induce several adverse cardiac effects. However, the underlying mechanisms of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of vandetanib-induced cardiotoxicity using intracellular electrophysiological recordings on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs), rabbit Purkinje fibers, and HEK293 cells transiently expressing human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG; the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNQ1/KCNE1 (the slowly activating delayed rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt;), KCNJ2 (the inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;) or SCN5A (the inward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt;). Purkinje fiber assays and ion channel studies showed that vandetanib at concentrations of 1 and 3 μM inhibited the hERG currents and prolonged the action potential duration. Alanine scanning and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; hERG docking studies demonstrated that Y652 and F656 in the hERG S6 domain play critical roles in vandetanib binding. In hiPSC-CMs, vandetanib markedly reduced the maximum rate of depolarization during the AP upstroke. Ion channel studies revealed that hiPSC-CMs were more sensitive to inhibition of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; by vandetanib than in a heterogeneously expressed HEK293 cell model, consistent with the changes in the AP parameters of hiPSC-CMs. The subclasses of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs inhibited &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; currents in a dose-dependent manner in hiPSC-CMs and SCN5A-encoded HEK293 cells. The inhibitory potency of vandetanib for &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; was much higher in hiPSC-CMs (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 2.72 μM) than in HEK293 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 36.63 μM).

Elucidation of the neural correlates of time perception constitutes an important research topic in cognitive neuroscience. The focus to date has been on durations in the millisecond to seconds range, but here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine brain functional connectivity during much longer durations (i.e., 15 min). For this purpose, we conducted an initial exploratory experiment followed by a confirmatory experiment. Our results showed that those participants who overestimated time exhibited lower activity of beta (18–30 Hz) at several electrode sites. Furthermore, graph theoretical analysis indicated significant differences in the beta range (15–30 Hz) between those that overestimated and underestimated time. Participants who underestimated time showed higher clustering coefficient compared to those that overestimated time. We discuss our results in terms of two aspects. FFT results, as a linear approach, are discussed within localized/dedicated models (i.e., scalar timing model). Second, non-localized properties of psychological interval timing (as emphasized by intrinsic models) are addressed and discussed based on results derived from graph theory. Results suggested that although beta amplitude in central regions (related to activity of BG-thalamocortical pathway as a dedicated module) is important in relation to timing mechanisms, the properties of functional activity of brain networks; such as the segregation of beta network, are also crucial for time perception. These results may suggest subjective time may be created by vector units instead of scalar ticks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ba2774aa</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amir Hossein Ghaderi, Shadi Moradkhani, Arvin Haghighatfard, Fatemeh Akrami, Zahra Khayyer, Fuat Balcı&lt;/p&gt;

Social medical insurance schemes are crucial for realizing universal health coverage and health equity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how reimbursement for injury-induced medical expenses is addressed in Chinese legislative documents relevant to social medical insurance. We retrieved legislative documents from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Lawyee databases. Four types of social medical insurance schemes were included: urban employee basic medical insurance, urban resident basic medical insurance, new rural cooperative medical system, and urban and rural resident medical insurance. Text analyses were conducted on all identified legislative documents. As a result, one national law and 1,037 local legislative documents were identified. 1,012 of the 1,038 documents provided for reimbursement. Of the 1,012 documents, 828 (82%) provided reimbursement only for injuries without a legally responsible person/party or not caused by self-harm, alcohol use, drug use, or other law violations, and 162 (16%) did not include any details concerning implementation. Furthermore, 760 (92%) of the 828 did not provide an exception clause applying to injuries when a responsible person/party could not be contacted or for situations when the injured person cannot obtain reimbursement from the responsible person/party. Thus, most Chinese legislative documents related to social medical insurance do not provide reimbursement for medical expenses from injuries having a legally responsible person/party or those caused by illegal behaviors. We argue that all injury-induced medical expenses should be covered by legislative documents related to social medical insurance in China, no matter what the cause of the injury. Further research is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of such policy changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>185e86e6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuyan Gao, Li Li, David C.

Further research is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of such policy changes.</description><title>Reimbursement for injury-induced medical expenses in Chinese social medical insurance schemes: A systematic analysis of legislative documents</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e1a:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194381</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194381</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521147600000</published><author><name>Yuyan Gao</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521135729687</crawled></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04162-9</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convert your weaknesses into assets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convert your weaknesses into assets, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04162-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04162-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Work out what you really enjoy doing, and pitch your skills accordingly, says Lia Paola Zambetti.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9faefaed</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convert your weaknesses into assets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convert your weaknesses into assets, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04162-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04162-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Work out what you really enjoy doing, and pitch your skills accordingly, says Lia Paola Zambetti.</description><title>Convert your weaknesses into assets</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162b017c9bf:1de33d4:9aea0a7d</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04162-9</link><published>1523343600000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04162-9</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04162-9/d41586-018-04162-9_15592938.jpg</url><height>576</height></visual><author><name>Lia Paola Zambetti</name></author><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.03</engagementRate><crawled>1523372771775</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194431</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194431</originId><updated>1522270800000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9984bae5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and patients &lt;p&gt;Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03).

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>eedb143f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women. Future work should seek to understand the nature of this association and whether there is promise in developing interventions to enhance executive function to reduce sexual risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2edbf8cc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Rosenberg, Audrey Pettifor, Mihaela Duta, Nele Demeyere, Ryan G.

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04–1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22–1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32–3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38–2.49).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity.

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is a risk factor of osteoporotic fracture (OF). Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) can differentiate into osteoclasts to resorb bone. It was known that PBM-expressed Anxa2 protein is associated with BMD, and extracellular Anxa2 protein promotes osteoclastogenesis. This study aimed to test 1) whether Anxa2 protein level in PBM differs significantly between subjects with OF and without fracture history (NF); 2) whether Anxa2 level in plasma is associated with BMD; 3) how Anxa2 protein at various concentrations would affect osteoblastic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. All the study subjects were Chinese Han elderly. Firstly, Anxa2 protein in PBM was identified and quantitated by LC-MS/MS and compared between 45 OF cases and 42 healthy controls. Secondly, plasma Anxa2 protein level was quantitated by ELISA and compared between unrelated subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD (0.63±0.10 vs. 1.05±0.10 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, n = 75). Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; functional assay was utilized to test the effects of extracellular Anxa2 protein on osteoblastic growth. We found that Anxa2 protein expression in PBM was significantly up-regulated in OF vs. NF subjects (fold change [FC)] = 1.16, P&amp;lt;0.05). Plasma Anxa2 protein concentration (range: 31.69–227.35ng/ml) was significantly elevated in low vs. high BMD subjects (84.85 vs. 66.15ng/ml, FC = 1.28, P&amp;lt;0.05). Cellular dynamical monitoring demonstrated that the general shape of dose-response relationship is the inverse U-shaped curve. Specifically, lower dose of Anxa2 protein may promote osteoblast growth and the optimal concentration for osteoblastic growth was around 50ng/ml, but even higher concentration could attenuate hFOB1.19 osteoprogenitor cell growth. We concluded that Anxa2 protein could attenuate osteoblast growth and be associated with hip BMD and OF in Chinese elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2885684e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Wen-Yu Wang, Xin Lu, Zhen-Huan Jiang, Yun-Hong Zhang, Ding-Hua Jiang, Jian-Nong Jiang, Hong-Qing Gao, Shu-Feng Lei, Fei-Yan Deng&lt;/p&gt;

Sponge-cyanobacteria associations have attracted research interest from an ecological, evolutionary and biotechnological perspective. Current knowledge is, in its majority, “hidden” in metagenomics research studying the entire microbial communities of sponges, while knowledge on these associations is totally missing for certain geographic areas. In this study, we (a) investigated the occurrence of cyanobacteria in 18 sponge species, several of which are studied for the first time for their cyanobionts, from a previously unexplored eastern Mediterranean ecoregion, the Aegean Sea, (b) isolated sponge-associated cyanobacteria, and characterized them based on a polyphasic (morphological-morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analysis) approach, and (c) conducted a meta-analysis on the global diversity of sponge species hosting cyanobacteria, as well as the diversity of cyanobacterial symbionts. Our research provided new records for nine sponge species, previously unknown for this association, while the isolated cyanobacteria were found to form novel clades within &lt;i&gt;Synechococcus&lt;/i&gt;, Leptolyngbyaceae, Pseudanabaenaceae, and Schizotrichaceae, whose taxonomic status requires further investigation; this is the first report of a Schizotrichaceae cyanobacterium associated with sponges. The extensive evaluation of the literature along with the new data from the Aegean Sea raised the number of sponge species known for hosting cyanobacteria to 320 and showed that the cyanobacterial diversity reported from sponges is yet underestimated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8308395c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Despoina Konstantinou, Vasilis Gerovasileiou, Eleni Voultsiadou, Spyros Gkelis&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3af0ee32</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

Seropositive patients were divided into three groups (low-positive, mid-positive, and high-positive) according to the Hp-IgG titer value.

The high-positive group was significantly younger (median age, 55.0 years), with a higher proportion of female (45.0%) and non-smokers (58.9%). The proportion of diffuse-type GC increased in the order low-, mid-, and high-positive groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, the factors associated with diffuse-type GC were younger age, female sex, non-smokers, and a high-positive Hp-IgG titer.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vector control remains the sole effective method to prevent dengue virus (DENV) transmission, although a vaccine for dengue has recently become available and testing of its efficacy and coverage is being performed in multiple places. Entomological surveillance is a key factor in alerting authorities to possible outbreaks, but until now natural DENV infection of mosquito populations has been scarcely used as an early warning system to monitor fluctuating prevalence of infected mosquitoes.

Total RNAs of the samples were extracted and the nested reverse transcriptase PCR assay for detecting and typing DENV was performed. Of the 1333 immature insects collected during the study period, 1186 (89%) were &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and 147 (11%) &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt;.

The quality of biological samples greatly affects the accuracy of scientific results. However, RNA in cryopreserved tissues gradually degrades during storage, leading to errors in the results of subsequent experiments. A suitable sample preservative solution can prolong storage and enhance the research value of samples. Here, we developed a sample preservative solution using the properties of the ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) and compared its effects on RNA and DNA quality, protein activity, and tissue morphology with the commercially available and widely used RNAlater® Stabilization Solution. The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4fd8268</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Reported communication issues included lack of communication training as well as time and workload issues. Two archetypes of narratives on PPC issues and practice emerged and are discussed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;While providers’ narratives put patients at the centre of care, there were indications that patient-provider communication training and practice need further development.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to gain insight into the physiological changes occurring in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) after autogenic drainage (AD). Changes in respiratory system resistance (Rrs), reactance (Xrs), and spirometry were analyzed in adult CF subjects after a single AD physiotherapy session.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective observational study was conducted during the annual check-up of adult CF subjects in stable condition. Spirometry and Rrs and Xrs measurements using the forced oscillations technique at 5, 11, and 19 hertz (Hz) were performed before and 30 min after a 20-min AD session. Control CF subjects were tested at baseline and 50 min without AD. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median [interquartile range].&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty subjects were included in the physiotherapy group (age 29 [25–34] years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 40.3 [30.1–57.9]% predicted) and 11 in the control group (age 31 [28.5–36.5] years, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 43.6 [31.1–51.9] % predicted). No significant changes in any parameter were observed in the control group. AD modestly but significantly increased the forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (p&amp;lt;0.001). Inspiratory resistance was also significantly improved by AD: Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; from 5.74±2.39 to 5.24±2.17 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.05; Rrs&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.83±1.98 to 4.32±1.7 cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p = 0.003; and Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; from 4.18 [3.46–5.07] to 3.86 [2.76–4.98] cmH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/L/s, p&amp;lt;0.001. In contrast, AD had no significant effects on frequency dependence of resistance (Rrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–Rrs&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;) or expiratory resistance. Inspiratory Xrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, but not ΔXrs&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (expiratory—inspiratory Xrs), was improved by AD (p&amp;lt;0.05).

Background &lt;p&gt;The impact of obesity on survival is known to vary in different cancers. Advanced biliary tract cancer was rarely analyzed about the relationship between obesity and prognosis. We performed this study to evaluate the BMI and body weight change as prognostic factors for advanced biliary tract cancer patients with palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between January 2005 and December 2016, two hundred and seventy-six patients who underwent chemotherapy for biliary tract cancer were retrospectively analyzed. The relationship between BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and clinical outcomes including overall and progression-free survival was assessed. Additionally the relationship between change in body composition and overall survival was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Median overall survival was 9.7 months for underweight patients, 10.1 months for normal patients, 15.8 months for overweight group, 13.1 months for obese patients, respectively. (p = 0.047) Univariate analysis showed that BMI, stage III, age less than 64 year-old, gallbladder cancer, operation, radiotherapy and ECOG performance were significantly associated with better survival. Compared with normal patients, overweight patients (BMI 23–24.9kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had a reduced risk of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR 0.632; 95% CI 0.436–0.918, p = 0.016). In the additional analysis for the effect of changes in body weight and BMI to the overall survival, decrease in body weight and BMI (HR 1.410, 95% CI 1.168–1.986, p = 0.046) was associated with a shorter in overall survival.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Overweight status and the maintenance of body weight during the initial period of chemotherapy are important and independent predictors of better overall survival in advanced biliary tract cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fbc1694c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinwoo Kang, Sang Hyub Lee, Jun Hyuk Son, Jae Woo Lee, Young Hoon Choi, Jin Ho Choi, Woo Hyun Paik, Ji Kon Ryu, Yong-Tae Kim&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; isolates as &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; (n = 158), &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida duobushaemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 2). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. Increasing isolation of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in recent years from diverse clinical specimens including bloodstream shows that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging non-&lt;i&gt;albicans Candida&lt;/i&gt; species in Kuwait causing a variety of infections. Inability of conventional identification methods to accurately identify this pathogen and multidrug-resistant nature of many strains calls for a greater understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors for acquiring &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; infection and management strategies in high-risk patients.

Given a selection of older papers from the journal that readers were unfamiliar with, could they pick out the ones that ended up getting cited more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this work, revised and expanded, is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194903&quot;&gt;subject of a paper&lt;/a&gt; in PLOS ONE (open access, by definition), and the author line features some blog pseudonyms, interestingly. A 2003 issue of JACS was selected, and respondents were asked the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers in the issue to you think are the most ‘significant’ (your own definition of ‘significant’ is what is important here)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without looking up numbers, which three papers do you think will have been cited the most to-date?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you most want to point out to other chemists?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which three papers would you want to shout about from the rooftops (i.e., tell anybody about, not just chemists)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to say that I seem to have skewed the set of responders a bit, since it appears that many of the people who answered the survey were readers of this blog following a link. Looking over the papers that were suggested, it seems that the correlation between the first set and the third (significant, and should be shared with other chemists) was pretty strong, as you might think, but that correlation between “significant” and “will have been cited the most” was somewhat weaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the correlation between what respondents thought would be the most cited articles and the actual ten-years-later citation counts was quite poor (see the paper’s Figure 1). Looking at Figure 2, you can see that none of the other questions, in fact, correlate well with the real citation counts (I would be rather unhappy if these graphs represented project assay correlations!) Of course, it’s also true that the respondents disagreed pretty significantly about which papers were significant in the first place. That’s strong evidence that the survey set was indeed composed of practicing chemists, because we rarely agree on much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are there indeed differences between “interesting, thought-provoking” papers and ones that you feel like telling other chemists about? Or between those and the ones that pick up citations? These data, though far from comprehensive, suggest that both of these may be true (as does ones own intuition, for what that’s worth). The paper tries to correlate responses to the reported areas of specialization of the responders, and there may well be something to that. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja034820y&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was cited 325 times over the next ten years, but only five responders to the survey picked it as one that would get cited. All five of them, though, indicated that they specialized in this general area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja0345423&quot;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; was selected by many survey responders as one that would pick up citations, but its actual ten-year citation count was average-to-modest. My own guess here (I may have picked this one myself!) was that the title sounded like something “hot”, by current standards, and it surely would have been picked up on. But that shows you the peril of such gut feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this does is drive yet another nail into the idea that current publication-based measures to evaluate research importance, quality, and impact are much good at all. They aren’t. The paper finishes up on just this point, referencing several other initiatives that are trying to overturn citation counts, h-indices, journal impact factors and so on. These things are measures, sure enough, but they’re not necessarily measuring very much, and not necessarily what some of their users think that they’re measuring!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a8dd49c3</fingerprint><description>Back in 2013, I mentioned the “JACS Challenge”, an interesting attempt to see if papers that eventually got cited a lot were obvious prima facie.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy were used to evaluate in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent corneal debridement and topical application of liquid and redissolved powder HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liquid form and redissolved lyophilized powder form HPLs had similar concentrations of EGF, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and rat models on wound healing demonstrated no significant difference between the liquid and redissolved lyophilized powder forms for HPLs, HPS and FBS. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; confocal microscopy revealed similar wound healing process at different layers of cornea after corneal epithelial debridement between liquid form and redissolved lyophilized power form of HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The redissolved lyophilized powder form of both commercialized HPLs showed similar growth factor concentrations and corneal epitheliotrophic abilities compared to the liquid form. Results suggest that the properties of liquid HPLs can be retained despite lyophilization and that lyophilized HPLs can be a treatment option for corneal epithelial disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f0d5b7f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lily Wei Chen, Chien-Jung Huang, Wen-Hui Tu, Chia-Ju Lu, Yi-Chen Sun, Szu-Yuan Lin, Wei-Li Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy were used to evaluate in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent corneal debridement and topical application of liquid and redissolved powder HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liquid form and redissolved lyophilized powder form HPLs had similar concentrations of EGF, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and rat models on wound healing demonstrated no significant difference between the liquid and redissolved lyophilized powder forms for HPLs, HPS and FBS. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; confocal microscopy revealed similar wound healing process at different layers of cornea after corneal epithelial debridement between liquid form and redissolved lyophilized power form of HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The redissolved lyophilized powder form of both commercialized HPLs showed similar growth factor concentrations and corneal epitheliotrophic abilities compared to the liquid form. Results suggest that the properties of liquid HPLs can be retained despite lyophilization and that lyophilized HPLs can be a treatment option for corneal epithelial disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>The corneal epitheliotrophic abilities of lyophilized powder form human platelet lysates</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e3:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194345</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194345</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521234000000</published><author><name>Lily Wei Chen</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521222125307</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31955</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><title>Research: A comprehensive and quantitative exploration of thousands of viral genomes</title><summary><content>The complete assembly of viral genomes from metagenomic datasets (short genomic sequences gathered from environmental samples) has proven to be challenging, so there still remain significant blind spots in our view of viral genomes through the lens of metagenomics.

Gut bacterial communities have been shown to be influenced by diet, host phylogeny and anatomy, but most of these studies have been done in captive animals. Here we compare the bacterial communities in the digestive tract of wild birds. We characterized the gizzard and intestinal microbiota among 8 wild Neotropical bird species, granivorous or frugivorous species of the orders Columbiformes and Passeriformes. We sequenced the V4 region of the &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene in 94 collected samples from 32 wild birds from 5 localities, and compared bacterial communities by foraging guild, organ, locality and bird taxonomy. &lt;i&gt;16S rRNA&lt;/i&gt; gene-based sequencing data were examined using QIIME with linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and metabolic pathways were predicted using PICRUSt algorism. We identified 8 bacterial phyla, dominated by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Beta diversity analyses indicated significant separation of gut communities by bird orders (Columbiformes vs. Passerifomes) and between bird species (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In lower intestine, PICRUSt shows a predominance of carbohydrate metabolism in granivorous birds and xenobiotics biodegradation pathways in frugivorous birds. Gizzard microbiota was significantly richer in granivorous, in relation to frugivorous birds (Chao 1; non-parametric t-test, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), suggesting a microbial gizzard function, beyond grinding food. The results suggest that the most important factor separating the bacterial community structure was bird taxonomy, followed by foraging guild. However, variation between localities is also likely to be important, but this could not been assessed with our study design.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e8e282f4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by M.

Epileptic seizures are known to follow specific changes in brain dynamics. While some algorithms can nowadays robustly detect these changes, a clear understanding of the mechanism by which these alterations occur and generate seizures is still lacking. Here, we provide crossvalidated evidence that such changes are initiated by an alteration of physiological network state dynamics. Specifically, our analysis of long intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from a group of 10 patients identifies a critical phase of a few hours in which time-dependent network states become less variable (&amp;quot;degenerate&amp;quot;), and this phase is followed by a global functional connectivity reduction before seizure onset. This critical phase is characterized by an abnormal occurrence of highly correlated network instances and is shown to be particularly associated with the activity of the resected regions in patients with validated postsurgical outcome. Our approach characterizes preseizure network dynamics as a cascade of 2 sequential events providing new insights into seizure prediction and control.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DHVkBqQJLvk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8c94dc9b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Adrià Tauste Campo, Alessandro Principe, Miguel Ley, Rodrigo Rocamora, Gustavo Deco&lt;/p&gt;

Using in-field bioreactors, we investigated the influence of exogenous microorganisms in groundwater planktonic and biofilm microbial communities as part of the Integrated Field Research Challenge (IFRC). After an acclimation period with source groundwater, bioreactors received either filtered (0.22 μM filter) or unfiltered well groundwater in triplicate and communities were tracked routinely for 23 days after filtration was initiated. To address geochemical influences, the planktonic phase was assayed periodically for protein, organic acids, physico-/geochemical measurements and bacterial community (via 16S rRNA gene sequencing), while biofilms (i.e. microbial growth on sediment coupons) were targeted for bacterial community composition at the completion of the experiment (23 d). Based on Bray-Curtis distance, planktonic bacterial community composition varied temporally and between treatments (filtered, unfiltered bioreactors). Notably, filtration led to an increase in the dominant genus, &lt;i&gt;Zoogloea&lt;/i&gt; relative abundance over time within the planktonic community, while remaining relatively constant when unfiltered. At day 23, biofilm communities were more taxonomically and phylogenetically diverse and substantially different from planktonic bacterial communities; however, the biofilm bacterial communities were similar regardless of filtration. These results suggest that although planktonic communities were sensitive to groundwater filtration, bacterial biofilm communities were stable and resistant to filtration. Bioreactors are useful tools in addressing questions pertaining to microbial community assembly and succession. These data provide a first step in understanding how an extrinsic factor, such as a groundwater inoculation and flux of microbial colonizers, impact how microbial communities assemble in environmental systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>96380ad6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geoff A.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7ce5bfc3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuval B.

We evaluated the feasibility and safety of nictitating membrane fixation to address reduced contact lens stability by the nictitating membrane in a rabbit model. Under general anesthesia, twelve animals received a horizontal mattress suture between the nictitating membrane and the upper eyelid of one eye. To assess the effects of this technique and secondary side effects, contact lens stability test, Schirmer tear test, tear break-up time measurement, eye tissue pathology and morphology were evaluated. Contact lens stability was increased after nictitating membrane fixation. The percentage of contact lens retention in the nictitating membrane fixed rabbit after 4 hours was 90% whereas that in the untreated rabbit was 42.5%. In addition, there were no significant differences in tear quantity and quality between the fixed and untreated eyes. Furthermore, no remarkable pathological lesions were found in gross observation during the 1-month time period or the following pathological examination. In this study, we demonstrated that nictitating membrane fixation increases contact lens stability without specific side effects using a rabbit model. This minimally invasive procedure could be useful when designing animal models for testing new contact lenses and has potential to apply to other biomaterial research on the ocular surface.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bfc59809</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Biosecurity is defined as the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of disease agents being introduced and/or spread. For pig production, several of these measures are routinely implemented (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, segregation). However, air as a potential vector of pathogens has long been disregarded. Filters for incoming and recirculating air were installed into an already existing ventilation plant at a fattening piggery (3,840 pigs at maximum) in Saxony, Germany. Over a period of three consecutive fattening periods, we evaluated various parameters including air quality indices, environmental and operating parameters, and pig performance. Animal data regarding respiratory diseases, presence of antibodies against influenza A viruses, PRRSV, and &lt;i&gt;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and lung health score at slaughter were recorded, additionally. There were no significant differences (p = 0.824) in total bacterial counts between barns with and without air filtration. Recirculating air filtration resulted in the lowest total dust concentration (0.12 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and lung health was best in animals from the barn equipped with recirculating air filtration modules. However, there was no difference in animal performance. Antibodies against all above mentioned pathogens were detected but mostly animals were already antibody-positive at re-stocking. We demonstrated that supply air filtration as well as recirculating air filtration technique can easily be implemented in an already existing ventilation system and that recirculating air filtration resulted in enhanced lung health compared to supply air-filtered and non-filtered barns. A more prominent effect might have been obtained in a breeding facility because of the longer life span of sows and a higher biosecurity level with air filtration as an add-on measure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>96acc23b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cindy Wenke, Janina Pospiech, Tobias Reutter, Bettina Altmann, Uwe Truyen, Stephanie Speck&lt;/p&gt;

Transfer entropy from non-uniform embedding is a popular tool for the inference of causal relationships among dynamical subsystems. In this study we present an approach that makes use of low-dimensional conditional mutual information quantities to decompose the original high-dimensional conditional mutual information in the searching procedure of non-uniform embedding for significant variables at different lags. We perform a series of simulation experiments to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed method to demonstrate its advantage compared to previous algorithms. The results provide concrete evidence that low-dimensional approximations can help to improve the statistical accuracy of transfer entropy in multivariate causality analysis and yield a better performance over other methods. The proposed method is especially efficient as the data length grows.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b8660dd1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Scabin is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme and is a putative virulence factor produced by the plant pathogen, &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces scabies&lt;/i&gt;. Previously, crystal structures of Scabin were solved in the presence and absence of substrate analogues and inhibitors. Herein, experimental (hydrogen-deuterium exchange), simulated (molecular dynamics), and theoretical (Gaussian Network Modeling) approaches were systematically applied to study the dynamics of apo-Scabin in the context of a Scabin·NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;·DNA model. MD simulations revealed that the apo-Scabin solution conformation correlates well with the X-ray crystal structure, beyond the conformation of the exposed, mobile regions. In turn, the MD fluctuations correspond with the crystallographic B-factors, with the fluctuations derived from a Gaussian network model, and with the experimental H/D exchange rates. An Essential Dynamics Analysis identified the dynamic aspects of the toxin as a crab-claw-like mechanism of two topological domains, along with coupled deformations of exposed motifs. The “crab-claw” movement resembles the motion of C3-like toxins and emerges as a property of the central β scaffold of catalytic single domain toxins. The exposure and high mobility of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; side motifs in the Scabin β-core suggest involvement in DNA substrate binding. A ternary Scabin·NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;·DNA model was produced via an independent docking methodology, where the intermolecular interactions correspond to the region of high mobility identified by dynamics analyses and agree with binding and kinetic data reported for wild-type and Scabin variants. Based on data for the Pierisin-like toxin group, the sequence motif R&lt;sub&gt;β1&lt;/sub&gt;–R&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt;–N&lt;sub&gt;Lc&lt;/sub&gt;–STT&lt;sub&gt;β2&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;PN&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt;–(QxE)&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt; emerges as a catalytic signature involved in the enzymatic activity of these DNA-acting toxins. However, these results also show that Scabin possesses a unique DNA-binding motif within the Pierisin-like toxin group.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1800d72c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel R.

In turn, the MD fluctuations correspond with the crystallographic B-factors, with the fluctuations derived from a Gaussian network model, and with the experimental H/D exchange rates. An Essential Dynamics Analysis identified the dynamic aspects of the toxin as a crab-claw-like mechanism of two topological domains, along with coupled deformations of exposed motifs. The “crab-claw” movement resembles the motion of C3-like toxins and emerges as a property of the central β scaffold of catalytic single domain toxins. The exposure and high mobility of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; side motifs in the Scabin β-core suggest involvement in DNA substrate binding. A ternary Scabin·NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;·DNA model was produced via an independent docking methodology, where the intermolecular interactions correspond to the region of high mobility identified by dynamics analyses and agree with binding and kinetic data reported for wild-type and Scabin variants. Based on data for the Pierisin-like toxin group, the sequence motif R&lt;sub&gt;β1&lt;/sub&gt;–R&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt;–N&lt;sub&gt;Lc&lt;/sub&gt;–STT&lt;sub&gt;β2&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;PN&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt;–(QxE)&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt; emerges as a catalytic signature involved in the enzymatic activity of these DNA-acting toxins. However, these results also show that Scabin possesses a unique DNA-binding motif within the Pierisin-like toxin group.</description><title>Dynamics of Scabin toxin.

Scant research is available on the impact of the current economic crisis and austerity policies on inequality in health services utilisation in Europe. This study aimed to describe the trends in horizontal inequity in the use of health services in Andalusia, Spain, during the early years of the Great Recession, and the contribution of demographic, economic and social factors. Consultation with a general practitioner (GP) and specialist, hospitalisation and emergency care were studied through the Andalusian Health Survey 2007 (pre-crisis) and 2011–2012 (crisis), using a composite income index as socioeconomic status (SES) indicator. Horizontal inequity indices (HII) were calculated to take differential healthcare needs into account, and a decomposition analysis of change in inequality between periods was performed. Results showed that before the crisis, the HII was positive (greater access for people with higher SES) for specialist visits but negative (greater access for people with lower SES) in the other three utilisation models. During the crisis no change was observed in inequalities in GP visits, but a pro-poor development was seen for the other types of utilisation, with hospital and emergency care showing significant inequality in favour of low income groups. Overall, the main contributors to pro-poor changes in utilisation were socio-economic variables and poor mental health, due to changes in their elasticities. Our findings show that inequalities in healthcare utilisation largely remained in favour of the less well-off, despite the cuts in welfare benefits and health services provision during the early years of the recession in Andalusia. Further research is needed to monitor the potential impact of such measures in subsequent years.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d99bca9c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Antonio Córdoba-Doña, Antonio Escolar-Pujolar, Miguel San Sebastián, Per E.

Until recently, it was only possible to sequence DNA into short strings called &apos;reads&apos;. Nanopore is a new sequencing technology to produce significantly longer reads.

&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. In this paper we focus on sentiment classification of Twitter data. Construction of sentiment classifiers is a standard text mining task, but here we address the question of how to properly evaluate them as there is no settled way to do so. Sentiment classes are ordered and unbalanced, and Twitter produces a stream of time-ordered data. The problem we address concerns the procedures used to obtain reliable estimates of performance measures, and whether the temporal ordering of the training and test data matters. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set). We find no significant difference between the best cross-validation and sequential validation. However, we observe that all cross-validation variants tend to overestimate the performance, while the sequential methods tend to underestimate it. Standard cross-validation with random selection of examples is significantly worse than the blocked cross-validation, and should not be used to evaluate classifiers in time-ordered data scenarios.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>97e9bea5</fingerprint><title>How to evaluate sentiment classifiers for Twitter time-ordered data?</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6e:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Igor Mozetič, Luis Torgo, Vitor Cerqueira, Jasmina Smailović&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts. We evaluated the influence of these assumptions on model projections of the number of infections and deaths prevented by expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A new dynamic model of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) was developed, which incorporated each of four alternative assumptions about disease progression used in previous models: (A) ART slows disease progression; (B) ART halts disease progression; (C) ART reverses disease progression by increasing CD4 count; (D) ART reverses disease progression, but disease progresses rapidly once treatment is stopped. The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM. Larger differences in the predicted fraction of HIV-related deaths averted were observed (up to 15pp). However, if ART dropouts could only reinitiate ART at CD4&amp;lt;200 cells/μl, assumption C predicted substantially larger fractions of HIV infections and deaths averted than other assumptions (up to 20pp and 37pp larger, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Different disease progression assumptions on and post-ART interruption did not affect the fraction of HIV infections averted with expanded ART, unless ART dropouts only re-initiated ART at low CD4 counts.

Different disease progression assumptions had a larger influence on the fraction of HIV-related deaths averted with expanded ART.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Influence of model assumptions about HIV disease progression after initiating or stopping treatment on estimates of infections and deaths averted by scaling up antiretroviral therapy</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f1:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194220</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521493200000</published><author><name>Kanes Sucharitakul</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1386.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Engineering, Materials Science</item></keywords><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Origami enables folding of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and biological systems.

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels control electrical rhythmicity in specialized brain and heart cells. We quantitatively analysed voltage-dependent activation of homotetrameric HCN2 channels and its modulation by the second messenger cAMP using global fits of hidden Markovian models to complex experimental data. We show that voltage-dependent activation is essentially governed by two separable voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: It stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP. Together, these results provide detailed new insight into the voltage- and cAMP-induced activation gating of HCN channels.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/syBDlU90QXo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9c9a9e5c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sabine Hummert, Susanne Thon, Thomas Eick, Ralf Schmauder, Eckhard Schulz, Klaus Benndorf&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and intraocular lens power (IOLP) of IOLMaster and Ultrasound in normal, long and short eyes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy-four normal eyes (≥ 22 mm and ≤ 25 mm), 74 long eyes (&gt; 25 mm) and 78 short eyes (&amp;lt; 22 mm) underwent AL and ACD measurements with both devices in the order of IOLMaster followed by Ultrasound. The IOLP were calculated using a free online LADAS IOL formula calculator.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The difference in AL and IOLP between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant when all three groups were combined. The difference in ACD between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant in the normal group (P&amp;lt;0.001) and short eye group (P&amp;lt;0.001) but not the long eye group (P = 0.465). For the IOLP difference between IOLMaster and Ultrasound in the normal group, the percentage of IOLP differences &amp;lt;|0.5|D, ≥|0.5|D&amp;lt;|0.75|D, ≥|0.75|D&amp;lt;|1.0|D, and ≥|1.0|D were 90.5%, 8.1%, 1.4% and 0%, respectively. For the long eye group, they were 90.5%, 5.4%, 4.1% and 0%, respectively. For the short eye group, they were 61.5%, 23.1%, 10.3%, and 5.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IOLMaster and Ultrasound have statistically significant differences in AL measurements and IOLP (using LADAS formula) for normal, long eye and short eye. The two instruments agree regarding ACD measurements for the long eye group, but differ for the normal and short eye groups.

The IOLP were calculated using a free online LADAS IOL formula calculator.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The difference in AL and IOLP between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant when all three groups were combined. The difference in ACD between IOLMaster and Ultrasound was statistically significant in the normal group (P&amp;lt;0.001) and short eye group (P&amp;lt;0.001) but not the long eye group (P = 0.465). For the IOLP difference between IOLMaster and Ultrasound in the normal group, the percentage of IOLP differences &amp;lt;|0.5|D, ≥|0.5|D&amp;lt;|0.75|D, ≥|0.75|D&amp;lt;|1.0|D, and ≥|1.0|D were 90.5%, 8.1%, 1.4% and 0%, respectively. For the long eye group, they were 90.5%, 5.4%, 4.1% and 0%, respectively. For the short eye group, they were 61.5%, 23.1%, 10.3%, and 5.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IOLMaster and Ultrasound have statistically significant differences in AL measurements and IOLP (using LADAS formula) for normal, long eye and short eye. The two instruments agree regarding ACD measurements for the long eye group, but differ for the normal and short eye groups. Moreover, the high percentage of IOLP differences greater than |0.5|D in the short eye group is noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Comparison of axial length, anterior chamber depth and intraocular lens power between IOLMaster and ultrasound in normal, long and short eyes</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e11:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194273</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194273</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521147600000</published><author><name>Jing Dong</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521135729687</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195327</originId><updated>1522962000000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew B.

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9f25fe34</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew B.

Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway. Collectively, these data suggest that pan class I HDAC inhibition is a novel pathway for regulating astrocytic apoE secretion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7f725708</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erica Dresselhaus, James M.

Births outside marriage (BoM) account for around 15% of all births globally. However, the distribution around the world is very uneven, as are cultural and political attitudes towards them. Studies from East Asia have shown that the percentage of such births is very low, with only modest increases in recent years. The orthodox demographic view holds that the maintenance of conservative views around the relationship between marriage and childbearing can play a role in keeping fertility low. Prenuptial pregnancies (PNP) (where births occur within eight months of marriage) have been identified as a growing phenomenon in Japan, possibly being an ‘alternative’ Asian pathway to family formation. As yet, no comprehensive statistical analysis of the trends of BoM or PNP has been performed for Hong Kong. Using a comprehensive microdata set of birth registration in Hong Kong from 1984–2015 (N = 1,680,831) we provide evidence of recent trends in such ‘alternative pathways’ to family formation and examine predictors through regression analysis. Our results indicate, in common with elsewhere in East Asia, low overall period rates of either BoM or PNP (although the latter has risen notably in recent years). While more recent birth cohorts exhibit higher prevalence of such births, their incomplete nature and higher expected propensity suggests that the figures are exaggerated. In our regression analysis, we find that lower educational attainment is a strong predictor of both BoM and PNP, suggesting that a bifurcation of experience may be occurring. This adds further evidence to the theory that the maintenance of traditional family formation systems in the context of revolutionised educational and work opportunities for women mean that the opportunity costs of the ‘marriage package’ become too high. Current disparities in rights and privileges between married and unmarried parents–and especially their children–means that targeted family planning services and support for vulnerable families are policy priorities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>de73defb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stuart Gietel-Basten, Georgia Verropoulou&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM). However, scant data exist on how patients with chronic multimorbidities currently experience the (re)-organisation of health services and what their perceived needs are in order to enhance the management of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A qualitative study was conducted in a community health centre treating both HIV and diabetes patients in Cape Town. The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma. Burden of these demands varied in difficulty among patient-participants due to capacity factors such as: positive attitudes, optimal health literacy, social support and availability of economic resources. Strategies mentioned by participants for improved continuity of care and self-management of multi-morbidities included integration of chronic services, consolidated guidelines for healthcare workers, educational materials for patients, improved information systems and income for patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Using the CCM to explore multimorbidity captured most of the themes around &amp;quot;patient workload&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;patient capacity”, and was thus a suitable framework to explore multimorbidity in this high HIV/T2D burden setting. Integration of chronic services and addressing social determinants of health may be the first steps towards alleviating patient burden and improving their access and utilisation of these services.

The human amniotic membrane (HAM) is widely used for its wound healing effect in clinical practice, as a feeder for the cell cultivation, or a source of cells to be used in cell therapy. The aim of this study was to find effective and safe enzymatic HAM de-epithelialization method leading to harvesting of both denuded undamaged HAM and viable human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs). The efficiency of de-epithelialization using TrypLE Express, trypsin/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and thermolysin was monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the measurement of DNA concentration. The cell viability was determined by trypan blue staining. Scanning electron microscopy and immunodetection of collagen type IV and laminin α5 chain were used to check the basement membrane integrity. De-epithelialized hAECs were cultured and their stemness properties and proliferation potential was assessed after each passage. The HAM was successfully de-epithelialized using all three types of reagents, but morphological changes in basement membrane and stroma were observed after the thermolysin application. About 60% of cells remained viable using trypsin/EDTA, approximately 6% using TrypLE Express, and all cells were lethally damaged after thermolysin application. The hAECs isolated using trypsin/EDTA were successfully cultured up to the 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; passage with increasing proliferation potential and decreased stem cell markers expression (&lt;i&gt;NANOG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX2&lt;/i&gt;) in prolonged cell culture.

Background &lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3–5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3–12 months is recommended in international guidelines. We assessed TOC and retesting practices including extragenital testing in general practitioner (GP) practices located in different socioeconomic status (SES) areas to inform and optimize local test practices.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Laboratory data of 48 Dutch GP practices between January 2011 and July 2016 were used. Based on a patient’s first positive CT or NG test, the proportion of TOC (&amp;lt;3 months) and retests (3–12 months) were calculated. Patient- and GP-related factors were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For CT (n = 622), 20% had a TOC and 24% had a retest at the GP practice. GP practices in low SES areas were more likely to perform a CT TOC (OR:1.8;95%CI:1.1–3.1). Younger patients (&amp;lt;25 years) were more likely to have a CT TOC (OR:1.6;95%CI:1.0–2.4). For CT (n = 622), 2.4% had a TOC and 6.1% had a retest at another STI care provider. For NG (n = 73), 25% had a TOC and 15% had a retest at the GP practice. For NG (n = 73), 2.7% had a TOC and 12.3% had a retest at another STI care provider. In only 0.3% of the consultations patients were tested on extragenital sites.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of the patients returned for a CT TOC, especially at GP practices in low SES areas. For NG, 1 out of 4 patients returned for a TOC. Retesting rates were low for both CT (24%) and NG (15%), (re)infections including extragenital infections may be missed.

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature. Compared with other IDPRS schemes in the standard model, our SA-RIDPRS scheme greatly reduces the computation overhead of verification.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e3d68030</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaodong Yang, Chunlin Chen, Tingchun Ma, Jinli Wang, Caifen Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Thus, both PHP induction and expression mechanisms are locally transmitted and restricted to specific synaptic compartments.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34338</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295b869fc:a2b1bf3:34f43e70</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34338</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34338</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1522886400000</published><author><name>dickman@usc.edu (Catherine Chen)</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>61</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>4.07</engagementRate><crawled>1522930313724</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00126</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00126/20180330/images/medium/bi-2018-00126e_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00126&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Agricultural crops play an important role in the global carbon and water cycle. Global climate change scenarios predict enhanced water scarcity and altered precipitation pattern in many parts of the world. Hence, a mechanistic understanding of water fluxes, productivity and water use efficiency of cultivated crops is of major importance, i.e. to adapt management practices. We compared water and carbon fluxes of paddy and rainfed rice by canopy scale gas exchange measurements, crop growth, daily evapotranspiration, transpiration and carbon flux modeling. Throughout a monsoon rice growing season, soil evaporation in paddy rice contributed strongly to evapotranspiration (96.6% to 43.3% from initial growth to fully developed canopy and amounted to 57.9% of total water losses over the growing seasons. Evaporation of rainfed rice was significantly lower (by 65% on average) particularly before canopy closure. Water use efficiency (WUE) was significantly higher in rainfed rice both from an agronomic (WUE&lt;sub&gt;agro&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. grain yield per evapotranspiration) and ecosystem (WUE&lt;sub&gt;eco&lt;/sub&gt;, i.e. gross primary production per evapotranspiration) perspective. However, our results also show that higher WUE in rainfed rice comes at the expense of higher respiration losses compared to paddy rice (26% higher on average). Hence, suggestions on water management depend on the regional water availability (i.e. Mediterranean vs. Monsoon climate) and the balance between higher respiratory losses versus a potential reduction in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gas emissions. Our results suggest that a shift from rainfed/unsaturated soil to waterlogged paddy conditions after closure of the rice canopy might be a good compromise towards a sustainable use of water while preserving grain yield, particularly for water-limited production areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5630449</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bhone Nay‐Htoon, Wei Xue, Steve Lindner, Matthias Cuntz, Jonghan Ko, John Tenhunen, Christiane Werner, Maren Dubbert&lt;/p&gt;

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5e6e4f2a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

By integrating constraint-based models and tools from network science, our framework allows the study of context-specific metabolic responses at a system level beyond standard pathway descriptions.</description><title>Flux-dependent graphs for metabolic networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16275d6ea85:77b8e51:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290767v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290767v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><published>1522393200000</published><author><name>Beguerisse-Diaz, M.</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522395441797</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3578</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3578.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Cellulose synthesis occurs exclusively at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs).

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits’ connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings and provides fundamental insights into the relationship between connectivity structure and neural responses in cortical circuits.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FNF84rL9qos&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bafb2a1e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher Ebsch, Robert Rosenbaum&lt;/p&gt;

These cortical interneurons are structurally and functionally diverse. Here, we use single-cell transcriptomics to study the origins of this diversity in the mouse.

Background &lt;p&gt;Understanding the epidemiological characteristics of anaphylaxis-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the first step toward developing preventative strategies and optimizing care systems. We aimed to describe and compare epidemiological features and clinical outcomes among patients with anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs according to causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified emergency medical service (EMS)-treated anaphylaxis-associated OHCA patients from a nationwide OHCA registry between 2008 and 2015. We compared epidemiological characteristics and outcomes according to causal agents (a natural agents group and an iatrogenic agents group) and evaluated temporal variability in incidence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to compare survival to discharge between causative agent groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the study period (8 years), the total number of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs was 233. A total of 224 eligible cases were included in the analysis. There were 192 patients (85.6%) in the natural agents group and 32 patients (14.3%) in the iatrogenic agents group. There was significant diurnal and seasonal variability in the frequency of anaphylaxis-associated OHCAs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values&amp;lt;0.01 for both), with the highest incidences occurring during the day (7:01 am to 3 pm; 64.6%) and in summer (June to August, 48.7%). Compared with the natural agents group, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for survival to discharge in the iatrogenic agents group was statistically insignificant (AOR 3.61, 95% CI 0.86 to 15.06).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The incidence of anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is considerably low, and significant temporal variability, with a peak during the day and in summer, is evident. Anaphylaxis-associated OHCA is more common by natural agents than by iatrogenic agents, but no difference in the survival-to-discharge rate is evident.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b4fda32</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sun Young Lee, Seung Chul Lee, Sang Do Shin, Kyoung Jun Song, Young Sun Ro, Jeong Ho Park, So Yeon Kong&lt;/p&gt;

Sorghum (&lt;i&gt;Sorghum bicolor&lt;/i&gt;) extract is traditionally used as red biocolorant in West Africa to colour foods, among which &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;, a soft cheese. This biocolorant is a source of the phytoalexin apigeninidin and phenolic acids, and users claim that it has preservative effects next to its colouring properties. If such a claim can be scientifically substantiated, it adds a valuable functional property to this natural red colorant, thereby increasing its potential applications in the food industry. Hence, the present study evaluated the antimicrobial properties of dye sorghum extracts using challenge tests in broth and &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; as a model of a popular food application. The alkaline extract and hot aqueous extract were used for dyeing &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; by 87.7% and 12.3% of the traders, respectively. The dyeing procedure is perceived as a preservation strategy, and is also a means to maximise the revenues. However, results demonstrated that the application of sorghum biocolorant on &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt; had no inhibitory effect on the growth of fungi (&lt;i&gt;Penicillium chrysogenum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cladosporium macrocarpum&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Furthermore, sorghum biocolorant in broth had no effect on growth of &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7. Consequently, the commonly used extracts for colouring soft West-African cheese did not show a preservative effect. In addition, dyeing did not affect the physico-chemical properties of &lt;i&gt;wagashi&lt;/i&gt;. Still, the red colour hampered visual detection of microbial growth, thus clarifying the preservative effect reported by users.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e29f6ef7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Folachodé U.

Plant-growth promotion has been linked to the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; genus since the beginning of this research field. In this work, we mined the genome of an Argentinean isolate of the recently described species &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;donghuensis&lt;/i&gt;. Strain SVBP6, isolated from bulk soil of an agricultural plot, showed a broad antifungal activity and several other plant-probiotic activities. As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach. Genome inspection confirmed our previous &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results about genes involved in several probiotic activities. Other genetic traits possibly involved in survival of SVBP6 in highly competitive environments, such as rhizospheres, were found. Tn&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis revealed that the antifungal activity against the soil pathogen &lt;i&gt;Macrophomina phaseolina&lt;/i&gt; was dependent on a functional &lt;i&gt;gacS&lt;/i&gt; gene, from the regulatory cascade Gac-Rsm, but it was not due to volatile compounds.

Background &lt;p&gt;Injuries are very common and can occur at any point of time in a day. Unintended injuries in kindergarten children are the most common and need immediate life saving care which is known as first aid. This study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors of first aid among kindergarten teachers of Lideta sub-city Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among kindergarten teachers. Data was collected using pretested, structured and self-administered questionnaire S1 File. The collected data was entered in to Epi Data version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between kindergarten teachers’ knowledge and attitudes towards first aid and different variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI and p&amp;lt;0.05 were computed to determine the presence of the association.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;One hundred and ninety-four teachers participated in the study with a response rate of 95%. Only 40% of the teachers were knowledgeable and 75% of them had positive attitude for first aid. Eighty percent of teachers encountered with children in need of first aid. Kindergarten teachers older than 35 years [AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: (1.02, 16.9)], five years’ experience [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.6)], having previous first aid training [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.7)], source of first aid information and teachers serving in private kindergarten are associated with having knowledge of first aid. Long time experience, type of kindergarten, previous training, and exposure to children in need of first aid were positive association with attitude towards first aid.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low first aid knowledge and high positive attitude among kindergarten teachers.

Background &lt;p&gt;Injuries are very common and can occur at any point of time in a day. Unintended injuries in kindergarten children are the most common and need immediate life saving care which is known as first aid. This study aimed to investigate knowledge, attitude, practice, and associated factors of first aid among kindergarten teachers of Lideta sub-city Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study was conducted among kindergarten teachers. Data was collected using pretested, structured and self-administered questionnaire S1 File. The collected data was entered in to Epi Data version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify association between kindergarten teachers’ knowledge and attitudes towards first aid and different variables. Odds ratios with 95% CI and p&amp;lt;0.05 were computed to determine the presence of the association.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;One hundred and ninety-four teachers participated in the study with a response rate of 95%. Only 40% of the teachers were knowledgeable and 75% of them had positive attitude for first aid. Eighty percent of teachers encountered with children in need of first aid. Kindergarten teachers older than 35 years [AOR = 4.2, 95%CI: (1.02, 16.9)], five years’ experience [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.6)], having previous first aid training [AOR = 3.1, 95%CI: (1.2, 7.7)], source of first aid information and teachers serving in private kindergarten are associated with having knowledge of first aid. Long time experience, type of kindergarten, previous training, and exposure to children in need of first aid were positive association with attitude towards first aid.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low first aid knowledge and high positive attitude among kindergarten teachers.

Hypovitaminosis D has been extensively documented in critically ill humans. However, whether or not critically ill dogs have alterations in vitamin D concentrations remains unconfirmed. The primary aims of our study were to compare serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] concentrations in critically ill dogs with healthy control dogs, determine the prognostic utility of serum 25(OH)D concentration as a biomarker in critically ill dogs, and to assess if serum 25(OH)D concentrations in critically ill dogs are associated with length of stay in the intensive care unit or illness severity. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D together with a range of other clinical, biochemical, and hematological parameters, were measured in 99 dogs within 24 hours of admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Critically ill dogs (P = 0.001) and dogs with sepsis (P = 0.002) had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy control dogs. In addition, serum 25(OH)D concentration was an independent predictor of in-hospital and 30 day survival. Using a cut-off of 33 ng/mL, serum 25(OH)D concentrations had excellent sensitivity (0.94; 95% CI, 0.71–1.00), but poor specificity (0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.53) for detection of survival. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with acute patient physiologic and laboratory evaluation (APPLE) fast score but were not associated with ICU length of stay. Hospitalized dogs with critical illness have decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations compared to healthy dogs and can be used to predict survival in this cohort.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>338237ea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jared A.

The Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly), &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt; (Wiedemann), is a key pest of fruit crops in many tropical, subtropical and mild temperate areas worldwide. The economic importance of this fruit fly is increasing due to its invasion of new geographical areas. Efficient control and eradication efforts require adequate information regarding &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; adults in relation to environmental and physiological cues. This would allow effective characterisation of the population spatio-temporal dynamic of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; population at both the orchard level and the area-wide landscape.
The aim of this study was to analyse population patterns of adult medflies caught using two trapping systems in a peach orchard located in central Italy. They were differentiated by adult sex (males or females) and mating status of females (unmated or mated females) to determine the spatio-temporal dynamic and evaluate the effect of cultivar and chemical treatments on trap catches. Female mating status was assessed by spermathecal dissection and a blind test was carried out to evaluate the reliability of the technique. Geostatistical methods, variogram and kriging, were used to produce distributional maps. Results showed a strong correlation between the distribution of males and unmated females, whereas males versus mated females and unmated females versus mated females showed a lower correlation. Both cultivar and chemical treatments had significant effects on trap catches, showing associations with sex and female mating status. Medfly adults showed aggregated distributions in the experimental field, but hot spots locations varied. The spatial pattern of unmated females reflected that of males, whereas mated females were largely distributed around ripening or ripe fruit. The results give relevant insights into pest management. Mated females may be distributed differently to unmated females and the identification of male hot spots through monitoring would allow localisation of virgin female populations. Based on our results, a more precise IPM strategy, coupled with effective sanitation practices, could represent a more effective approach to medfly control.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9bff587c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrea Sciarretta, Maria Rosaria Tabilio, Elena Lampazzi, Claudio Ceccaroli, Marco Colacci, Pasquale Trematerra&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;African Americans are disproportionately affected by both HIV and hypertension. Failure to modify risk factors for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease such as hypertension among HIV-infected patients may attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy. In the general population, African Americans with hypertension are less likely to have controlled blood pressure than whites. However, racial differences in blood pressure control among HIV-infected patients are not well studied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating racial differences in hypertension prevalence, treatment, and control among 1,664 patients attending the University of Alabama at Birmingham HIV Clinic in 2013. Multivariable analyses were performed to calculate prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the measure of association between race and hypertension prevalence and control while adjusting for other covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean age of patients was 47 years, 77% were male and 54% African-American. The prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared with whites (49% vs. 43%; p = 0.02). Among those with hypertension, 91% of African Americans and 93% of whites were treated (p = 0.43). Among those treated, 50% of African Americans versus 60% of whites had controlled blood pressure (systolic blood pressure &amp;lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &amp;lt;90 mmHg) (p = 0.007). After multivariable adjustment for potential confounders, prevalence of hypertension was higher among African Americans compared to whites (PR 1.25; 95% CI 1.12–1.39) and prevalence of BP control was lower (PR 0.80; 95% CI 0.69–0.93).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Despite comparable levels of hypertension treatment, African Americans in our HIV cohort were less likely to achieve blood pressure control. This may place them at increased risk for adverse outcomes that disproportionately impact HIV-infected patients, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and thus attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>27d56c6d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Greer A.

This may place them at increased risk for adverse outcomes that disproportionately impact HIV-infected patients, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, and thus attenuate the benefits conferred by combination antiretroviral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Racial disparities in the prevalence and control of hypertension among a cohort of HIV-infected patients in the southeastern United States</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef0d:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194940</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194940</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Greer A.

Background and objectives &lt;p&gt;The clinical implications of the discordance between the risk of exacerbations and the level of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are still unknown.

The data, collected by the Taiwan Obstructive Lung Disease consortium, were managed and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the enrolled participants, 316 (41.7%) had an inconsistency between the risk of exacerbations and the severity of airflow limitation. Univariate analysis showed that more severe airflow limitation (p = 0.000), higher COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (p = 0.003) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scales (p = 0.008), and the presence of at least one (p = 0.000) or two (p = 0.003) co-morbidities were significantly associated with such inconsistency.

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species.

The &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito is the principal vector of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus. These arboviruses are transmitted during adult female mosquito bloodfeeding. While these viruses must transverse the midgut to replicate, the blood meal must also reach the midgut to be digested, absorbed, or excreted, as aggregation of blood meal metabolites can be toxic to the female mosquito midgut. The midgut peritrophic matrix (PM), a semipermeable extracellular layer comprised of chitin fibrils, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, is one such mechanism of protection for the mosquito midgut. However, this structure has not been characterized for adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. We conducted a mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis to identify proteins that comprise or are associated with the adult female &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; early midgut PM. Altogether, 474 unique proteins were identified, with 115 predicted as secreted. GO-term enrichment analysis revealed an abundance of serine-type proteases and several known and novel intestinal mucins. In addition, approximately 10% of the peptides identified corresponded to known salivary proteins, indicating &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes extensively swallow their own salivary secretions. However, the physiological relevance of this remains unclear, and further studies are needed to determine PM proteins integral for midgut protection from blood meal derived toxicity and pathogen protection. Finally, we describe substantial discordance between previously described transcriptionally changes observed in the midgut in response to a bloodmeal and the presence of the corresponding protein in the PM.

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Annual rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from mixed-effects Poisson regression models evaluating the relationship between shale gas activity and reported annual STI rates while adjusting for secular trends and potential confounders obtained from the US Census.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to counties with no shale gas activity, counties with high activity had 21% (RR = 1.21; 95%CI = 1.08–1.36) increased rates of chlamydia and 19% (RR = 1.27; 95%CI 0.98–1.44) increased rates of gonorrhea, respectively. No association was observed for syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This first report of a link between shale gas activity and increased rates of both chlamydia and gonorrhea may inform local policies and community health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d51c9d5f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole C.

Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America. Our results here should be considered in disease mitigation programs if emergent arboviruses are to be effectively diminished in Panama through vector suppression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ee1f55c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gilberto A.

Offspring survival is generally more variable than adult survival and may limit population growth. Although white-tailed deer neonate survival has been intensively investigated, recent work has emphasized how specific cover types influence neonate survival at local scales (single study area). These localized investigations have often led to inconsistences within the literature. Developing specific hypotheses describing the relationships among environmental, habitat, and landscape factors influencing white-tailed deer neonate survival at regional scales may allow for detection of generalized patterns. Therefore, we developed 11 hypotheses representing the various effects of environmental (e.g., winter and spring weather), habitat (e.g., hiding and escape cover types), and landscape factors (e.g., landscape configuration regardless of specific cover type available) on white-tailed deer neonate survival up to one-month and from one- to three-months of age. At one-month, surviving fawns experienced a warmer lowest recorded June temperature and more June precipitation than those that perished. At three-months, patch connectance (percent of patches of the corresponding patch type that are connected within a predefined distance) positively influenced survival. Our results are consistent with white-tailed deer neonate ecology: increased spring temperature and precipitation are likely associated with a flush of nutritional resources available to the mother, promoting increased lactation efficiency and neonate growth early in life. In contrast, reduced spring temperature with increased precipitation place neonates at risk to hypothermia. Increased patch connectance likely reflects increased escape cover available within a neonate’s home range after they are able to flee from predators. If suitable escape cover is available on the landscape, then managers could focus efforts towards manipulating landscape configuration (patch connectance) to promote increased neonate survival while monitoring spring weather to assess potential influences on current year survival.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2ecedc0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric S.

The hypothesis that pigs placed on diets with reduced indispensable amino acid (AA) content attempts to offset the reduction in the nutrient density with increased feed intake was tested. In the experiment, feeds with a high or a low AA content were administrated to pigs fed &lt;i&gt;ad-libitum&lt;/i&gt; or restrictively according to a 2 × 2 factorial design. Ninety-six barrows were housed in 8 pens (12 pigs/pen) equipped with automatic feeders. Within pen, and from 47 body weight (BW) onwards, 6 pigs were fed &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt;. The others pigs were allowed to consume, as a maximum, the feed amounts indicated by the breeding company feeding plane to optimize the feed efficiency. In early (86–118 kg BW) and late (118–145 kg BW) finishing, the pigs of 4 pens received feeds with high indispensable AA contents (8.1 and 7.5 g lysine/kg in the two periods, respectively). The other pigs received feeds with reduced indispensable AA contents (lysine, methionine, threonine and tryptophan) by 9 and 18% in early and late finishing, respectively. Body lipid and protein (Pr) retentions were estimated from BW and back-fat depth measures recorded at the beginning and the end of each period. Nitrogen excretion was estimated as actual intake minus estimated N-retention (Pr/6.25). Pigs were slaughtered at 144 kg BW. Restricted feeding decreased feed intake (-7%), daily gain (-5%), carcass weight (-2.6%) and back-fat depth (-8.0%) but increased gain:feed ratio (+2%). The AA restriction increased feed intake (+5.9%), carcass weight (+4.9%) and intramuscular fat (+17.6%), and reduced carcass weight variation (-36%), with no effects on the feed efficiency and the estimated Pr (142 g/d). N excreted was reduced by feed (-9%) and dietary AA (-15%) restrictions.

Moreover, the spectra exhibit different connections to various dopant types and positions: the graphitic‐type dopant species present large variety in absorption profiles, while the pyridinic‐type ones show extraordinary uniform stability and spectra independent of dopant positions/numbers and hence are hardly distinguishable from each other. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><title>Theoretical study of nitrogen‐doped graphene nanoflakes: Stability and spectroscopy depending on dopant types and flake sizes</title><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162956fcc6f:a3d99e5:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25206?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25206?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><published>1520236800000</published><author><name>Chih‐KaiLin</name></author><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522925554799</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37316</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item></keywords><title>Correction: PGAM5 promotes lasting FoxO activation after developmental mitochondrial stress and extends lifespan in Drosophila</title><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>6c5de1c6</fingerprint><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37316</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162af313e53:1bf7f97:923c4a60</id><published>1523318400000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37316</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37316</link><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523357662803</crawled></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25102?af=R</originId><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>2b31058d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162658ab04b:6ce22:76251cdd</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25102?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25102?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><published>1522122010699</published><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522122010699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00167</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage degradation but also by other joint tissues modifications like subchondral bone sclerosis. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to compare secretome of osteoblast isolated from sclerotic (SC) or non sclerotic (NSC) area of OA subchondral bone.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Secretome was analyzed using differential quantitative and relative label free analysis on nanoUPLC G2 HDMS system. mRNA of the more differentially secreted proteins were quantified by RT-PCR in cell culture from 5 other patients. Finally, osteomodulin and fibulin-3 sequences were quantified by western blot and immunoassays in serum and culture supernatants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;175 proteins were identified in NSC osteoblast secretome. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD008494. Compared to NSC osteoblast secretome, 12 proteins were significantly less secreted (Osteomodulin, IGFBP5, VCAM-1, IGF2, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, versican, calumenin, IGFBP2, thrombospondin-4, periostin, reticulocalbin 1 and osteonectin), and 13 proteins were significantly more secreted by SC osteoblasts (CHI3L1, fibulin-3, SERPINE2, IGFBP6, SH3BGRL3, SERPINE1, reticulocalbin3, alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, TIMP-2, IGFBP3, TIMP-1, SERPINF1, CSF-1). Similar changes in osteomodulin, IGF2, SERPINE1, fibulin-3 and CHI3L1 mRNA levels were observed. ELISAs assays confirm the decrease by half of osteomodulin protein in SC osteoblasts supernatant compared to NSC and in OA patients serum compared to healthy subjects. Fibulin-3 epitopes Fib3-1, Fib3-2 and Fib3-3 were also increased in SC osteoblasts supernatant compared to NSC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We highlighted some proteins differentially secreted by the osteoblasts coming from OA subchondral bone sclerosis. These changes contribute to explain some features observed in OA subchondral bone, like the increase of bone remodeling or abnormalities in bone matrix mineralization. Among identified proteins, osteomodulin was found decreased and fibulin-3 increased in serum of OA patients. These findings suggest that osteomodulin and fibulin-3 fragments could be biomarkers to monitor early changes in subchondral bone metabolism in OA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>31ad2d79</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christelle Sanchez, Gabriel Mazzucchelli, Cécile Lambert, Fanny Comblain, Edwin DePauw, Yves Henrotin&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to document the effects of an eight hour journey on behavioural, clinical, haematological, environmental and respiratory parameters, and to identify possible associations between factors. Twelve horses underwent clinical examination, respiratory endoscopy with tracheal wash (TW) aspiration, and collection of venous and arterial blood before (BJ) and after the journey (AJ). TW were submitted for conventional quantitative bacteriological evaluation and genetic microbiome analyses. Behaviour was assessed in stables prior to transportation and throughout the journey. Transportation caused mild, but significant, effects on fluid and electrolyte balance and an acute phase response, characterized by neutrophilia, hyperfibrinogenaemia and hyperglobulinaemia. The proportion of neutrophils in TW, tracheal mucus and TW bacterial concentration was increased AJ, with preferential replication of &lt;i&gt;Pasteurellaceae&lt;/i&gt;. Horse behaviour &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; predicted clinical and respiratory outcomes. The frequency of stress related behaviours was greatest in the first hour of the journey, and balance-related behaviours were most common in the final hour of the journey. Horses which lowered their heads less frequently &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; and showed more stress-related behaviours had higher physiological stress (serum cortisol and heart rate on arrival), increased tracheal mucus and inflammation scores, and higher TW bacterial concentration AJ (P&amp;lt;0.05). Six horses with abnormal lung auscultation AJ proved to have had higher tracheal inflammation scores at preloading (P = 0.017), an overall higher concentration of bacteria in their TW (P = 0.013), and an increased percentage of neutrophils in TW at five days AJ (P = 0.003) in comparison to the other horses. While transport-related health problems are multifactorial, clinical examination, including auscultation and endoscopic inspection of the lower respiratory tract before and after journey, and behavioural observation &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; may identify animals at increased risk of transport associated respiratory disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9999fc62</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Padalino, Sharanne L.

While transport-related health problems are multifactorial, clinical examination, including auscultation and endoscopic inspection of the lower respiratory tract before and after journey, and behavioural observation &lt;i&gt;en route&lt;/i&gt; may identify animals at increased risk of transport associated respiratory disease.</description><title>Behaviour during transportation predicts stress response and lower airway contamination in horses</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123918:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194272</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521752400000</published><author><name>Barbara Padalino</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521740721801</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193899</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193899</originId><updated>1520888400000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Meng-Hsing Wu, Pei-Fang Su, Kuan-Ya Chen, Tung-Hee Tie, Hsu-Cheng Ke, Hau Chen, Yu-Chi Su, Yu-Chen Su, Huang-Tz Ou&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess predictive ability of heart rate variability (HRV) for pregnancy outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Research design and method &lt;p&gt;A total of 180 women with 261 cycles of IVF and 211 embryo transfers (ETs) were analyzed. HRV was measured at four times during IVF treatment: the first date of menstruation, r-HCG (Ovidrel) administration, and before and after ET. Pregnancy indicators included chemical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy (&gt; 10 weeks), and live birth (pregnancy &gt; 24 weeks). Mixed effect models were applied to identify predictors for IVF pregnancy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess prediction models for pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The HRV values increased during IVF treatment and then decreased after ET. The trend of changes in HRV values during IVF treatment was significant among patients with chemical pregnancy (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and those with live birth (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02). Women without pregnancy had lower HRV compared to those with IVF pregnancy (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). With a one unit increase in HRV difference before and after ET, the odds of chemical pregnancy decreased by 18% (odds ratio; OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70–0.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.02). With a one year increase in maternal age, the odds decreased by 16% (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.76–0.93, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), 25% (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58–0.93, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), and 28% (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54–0.91, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01) for chemical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and live birth, respectively. The AUCs were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.84), 0.89 (0.79, 0.98), and 0.91(0.83, 0.99) for the prediction models for chemical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, and live birth, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Reduced HRV may be an indicator for low chance of IVF pregnancy.

The relationships of the monogeneric family Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 (Coleoptera: Elateroidea) have remained contentious due to its modified morphology, incorrect information on incomplete metamorphosis of females and the absence of molecular data. We produced the sequences for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;angulosus&lt;/i&gt; (Germar, 1844) (the type-species of &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852) and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses to estimate its position. The analyses of Elateroidea (186 spp.) and Elateridae (110 spp.) molecular datasets of two mitochondrial and two nuclear gene fragments repeatedly placed &lt;i&gt;Plastocerus&lt;/i&gt; Schaum, 1852 in relationships with the elaterid genera &lt;i&gt;Oxynopterus&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842 and &lt;i&gt;Pectocera&lt;/i&gt; Hope, 1842. Alternative topologies were rejected by likelihood tests. Therefore, Plastoceridae Crowson, 1972 are down-ranked to the subfamily Plastocerinae in Elateridae Leach, 1815. We suggest that the morphology-based placement and high rank for some elateroid lineages were inferred from the presence of homoplasies which evolved due to incomplete sclerotization. Distantly related soft-bodied elateroids share freely movable and transverse coxae, a shortened prosternum, and a weakly sclerotized abdomen with free ventrites. Importantly, the apomorphic structures characteristic for their closest relatives, such as the prosternal process, mesoventral cavity, and intercoxal keel in the first abdominal ventrite are regularly absent. Consequently, morphology-based phylogenetic analyses suggest deeply rooted positions for lineages without expressed apomorphic character states. Molecular data represent an independent character system that is not affected by the convergent morphological evolution, and therefore molecular phylogenies can elucidate the relationships of incompletely sclerotized lineages.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d0af45d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ladislav Bocak, Michal Motyka, Matej Bocek, Milada Bocakova&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking. This paper’s overall purpose is to identify which combination of activities, and at which level, hold the potential to facilitate systems changes to better support ear health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We began with a review of documents identified in consultation with stakeholders and an online search. In addition, key informants were invited to participate in an online survey and a face-to-face or phone interview. Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide were used to explore survey responses in more depth. We also undertook interviews at the community level to elicit a diverse range of views. Ideas, statements or activities reported in the documents and interviews as being performed under the Intervention Level Framework were identified using qualitative thematic and content analysis. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also undertaken, whereby data was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and coded under the relevant strategic directions and performance indicators of the Framework. Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ea9b2d45</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jo Durham, Lisa Schubert, Lisa Vaughan, Cameron D.

Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the bloodstream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded blood vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct.

Although lymph node metastasis in cancer patients correlates with poor prognosis, evidence is lacking as to whether and how tumor cells enter the bloodstream via lymph nodes. To investigate this question, we delivered carcinoma cells into the lymph nodes of mice by microinfusing the cells into afferent lymphatic vessels. We found that tumor cells rapidly infiltrated the lymph node parenchyma, invaded blood vessels, and seeded lung metastases without involvement of the thoracic duct.

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>42b24064</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel Borchardt, Cullen Moran, Stuart Cantrill, Chemjobber, See Arr Oh, Matthew R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypothermia is widely associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, but remains a pervasive global problem. No studies have examined the impact of hypothermia on outcomes for preterm infants treated with CPAP for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective analysis assessed the impact of hypothermia on outcomes of 65 neonates diagnosed with RDS and treated with either nasal oxygen (N = 17) or CPAP (N = 48) in a low-resource setting. A classification tree approach was used to develop a model predicting survival for subjects diagnosed with RDS.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Survival to discharge was accurately predicted based on three variables: mean temperature, treatment modality, and mean respiratory rate. None of the 23 neonates with a mean temperature during treatment below 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of treatment modality. Among neonates with a mean temperature exceeding 35.8°C, the survival rate was 100% for the 31 neonates treated with CPAP and 36.4% for the 11 neonates treated with nasal oxygen (p&amp;lt;0.001). For neonates treated with CPAP, outcomes were poor if more than 50% of measured temperatures indicated hypothermia (5.6% survival). In contrast, all 30 neonates treated with CPAP and with more than 50% of temperature measurements above 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of initial temperature.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results of our study suggest that successful implementation of CPAP to treat RDS in low-resource settings will require aggressive action to prevent persistent hypothermia. However, our results show that even babies who are initially cold can do well on CPAP with proper management of hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6ec92a21</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Carns, Kondwani Kawaza, MK Quinn, Yinsen Miao, Rudy Guerra, Elizabeth Molyneux, Maria Oden, Rebecca Richards-Kortum&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled. Serum samples were collected from patients with OSA at diagnostic polysomnography and from patients with ACS at disease onset. Serum NBL1-Ab level was measured by amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay and its association with clinical variables related to atherosclerosis was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;NBL1-Ab level was significantly elevated in patients with both OSA and ACS compared with HVs. Subgroup analyses showed that NBL1-Ab level was markedly higher in patients with severe OSA and OSA patients with a history of CAD. Weak associations were observed between NBL1-Ab level and apnea-hypopnea index, age, mean SpO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and arousal index, whereas significantly higher NBL1-Ab levels were observed in OSA patients with a history of CAD than in those without a history of CAD. Sensitivity analysis using a logistic regression model also demonstrated that increased NBL1-Ab levels were associated with the previous history of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Elevated NBL1-Ab levels may be associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA, which needs to be confirmed further.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1): A potential biomarker for coronary artery disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef1a:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195015</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522357200000</published><author><name>Takuma Matsumura</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522345504828</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/286906</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286906v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Gene regulatory effects of microRNAs at a posttranscriptional level has been established over the last decade.

Urinary type IV collagen (U-Col4) and albumin excretion is evaluated to monitor the development of diabetic kidney disease. However, U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, 1067 participants without diabetes and with urinary albumin-creatinine ratio &amp;lt;300 mg/gCr (normo- or microalbuminuria) who underwent an annual health examination in 2004 were enrolled and observed for 5 years. They were divided according to the amount of U-Col4 or urinary albumin excreted. The decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. In participants with eGFR ≥80 mL/min, abnormal U-Col4 excretion was indicated as a significant independent risk factor for 10% eGFR change per year, which is one of the prognostic factors for the development of end-stage kidney disease. Moreover, in contrast to urinary albumin excretion, U-Col4 excretion was not related to age or kidney function, suggesting that some individuals with abnormal U-Col4 excretion can have an independent hidden risk for the development of kidney dysfunction. In conclusion, it is important to measure U-Col4 excretion in the general population without diabetes to determine changes in renal features in every individual and help detect future complications such as diabetic kidney disease. If U-Col4 excretion is abnormal, kidney manifestation should be carefully followed up, even if the kidney function and urinalysis findings are normal.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a4d1fbb0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fumi Kishi, Kojiro Nagai, Norimichi Takamatsu, Tatsuya Tominaga, Masanori Tamaki, Eriko Shibata, Taichi Murakami, Seiji Kishi, Hideharu Abe, Yasuhiko Koezuka, Naoto Minagawa, Go Ichien, Toshio Doi&lt;/p&gt;

Genomic prediction exploits single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome for predicting genetic merit of selection candidates. In most models for genomic prediction, e.g. BayesA, B, C, R and GBLUP, independence of SNP effects is assumed. However, SNP effects are expected to be locally dependent given the presence of a nearby QTL because SNPs surrounding the QTL do not segregate independently. A consequence of ignoring this dependence is that SNPs with small effects may be overly shrunk, e.g. effects from markers with high minor allele frequencies (MAF) that flank QTL with low MAF. A nested mixture model (BayesN) is developed to account for the dependence of effects of SNPs that are closely linked, where the effects of SNPs in every non-overlapping genomic window &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; follow a point mass at zero for all SNPs or a mixture of some SNPs with nonzero effects and others with zero effects. It can be regarded as a parsimonious alternative to the existing antedependence model, antiBayesB, which allow a nonstationary dependence of SNP effects. Illumina 777K BovineHD genotypes from 948 Angus cattle were used to simulate 5,000 offspring, with 4,000 used for training and 1,000 for validation. Scenarios with 300 common (MAF &gt; 0.05) or rare (MAF &amp;lt; 0.05) QTL randomly selected from segregating SNPs were replicated 8 times. SNPs corresponding to QTL were masked from a 600k panel comprising SNPs with MAF &gt; 0.05 or a 50k evenly spaced subset of these. Compared with BayesB and a modified antiBayesB, BayesN improved the accuracy of prediction up to 2.0% with 50k SNPs and up to 7.0% with 600k SNPs, most improvements occurring in the rare QTL scenario. Computing time was reduced up to 60% with 50k SNPs and up to 75% with 600k SNPs. BayesN is an accurate and computationally efficient method for genomic prediction with whole-genome SNPs, especially for traits with rare QTL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2b0a2650</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Zeng, Dorian Garrick, Jack Dekkers, Rohan Fernando&lt;/p&gt;

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>42fe5b05</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atsushi Takagi, Francesco Usai, Gowrishankar Ganesh, Vittorio Sanguineti, Etienne Burdet&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The paced serial addition test (PSAT) is regularly used to assess cognitive deficits in various neuropsychiatric conditions. Being a complex test, it reflects the status of multiple cognitive domains such as working memory, information processing speed and executive functioning. Two versions of the PSAT exist. One uses auditory stimuli through spoken numbers and is known as the PASAT, while the other one presents patients with visual stimuli and is called PVSAT. The PASAT is considered more frustrating by patients, and hence the visual version is usually preferred. Research has suggested that an interference might exist between patients’ verbal answers and the auditory presentation of stimuli. We therefore removed the verbal response in this study, and aimed to investigate differences in functional brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifteen healthy controls performed the two test versions inside an MRI scanner—switching between stimulus modality (auditory vs. visual) as well as inter-stimulus frequency (3s vs. 2s). We extracted 11 independent components from the data: attentional, visual, auditory, sensorimotor and default mode networks. We then performed statistical analyses of mean network activity within each component, as well as inter-network connectivity of each component pair during the different task types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, we noted an effect of modality on activity in the visual and auditory components. However, we also describe bilateral frontoparietal, anterior cingulate and insular attentional network activity. An effect of frequency was noted only in the sensorimotor network. Effects were found on edges linking visual and auditory regions. Task modality influenced an attentional-sensorimotor connection, while stimulus frequency had an influence on sensorimotor-default mode connections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Scanner noise during functional MRI may interfere with brain activation—especially during tasks involving auditory pathways. The question whether to use PVSAT or PASAT for an fMRI study is, therefore, an important one. Specific effects of both modalities should be known to study designers. We conclude that both tests should not be considered interchangeable, as significant changes were brought to light during test performance in different modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f61a8083</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeroen Gielen, Wietse Wiels, Jeroen Van Schependom, Jorne Laton, Wim Van Hecke, Paul M.

Despite the importance of 3D spatial localization to parse objects in the environment and to guide movement, most neurophysiological investigations of sensory mapping have been limited to studies of restrained subjects, tested with 2D, artificial stimuli. Here, we show for the first time that sensory neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of the free-flying echolocating bat encode 3D egocentric space, and that the bat’s inspection of objects in the physical environment sharpens tuning of single neurons, and shifts peak responses to represent closer distances.

Despite the importance of 3D spatial localization to parse objects in the environment and to guide movement, most neurophysiological investigations of sensory mapping have been limited to studies of restrained subjects, tested with 2D, artificial stimuli. Here, we show for the first time that sensory neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of the free-flying echolocating bat encode 3D egocentric space, and that the bat’s inspection of objects in the physical environment sharpens tuning of single neurons, and shifts peak responses to represent closer distances.

Their mean age was 62.7 years. The majority were males and smokers. Specimens were mostly from respiratory sources (97%). Common comorbidities included chronic lung disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), solid tumor, systemic disease, and diabetes mellitus. Productive cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms. Frequent radiographic findings were infiltrates and nodules on chest X-ray and nodules, infiltrates, and bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography scan. Among 18 tested isolates, 5.8% were resistant to clarithromycin, 11.7% to amikacin, and 70–100% to other antimicrobials. Out of 13 patients receiving early treatment, 5 noted improvement, one had recurrence of symptoms, two received alternative diagnosis, and five died. Two of those deaths were related to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;simiae&lt;/i&gt;. Common treatment regimens included clarithromycin in different combinations with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, moxifloxacin, and amikacin. Moreover, clofazimine was used in only two patients whose isolates were resistant to all but one agent.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c5d67f74</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rana Jajou, Albert de Neeling, Rianne van Hunen, Gerard de Vries, Henrieke Schimmel, Arnout Mulder, Richard Anthony, Wim van der Hoek, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;×floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>2f33a0a6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zdeněk Kaplan, Judith Fehrer, Veronika Bambasová, C.

Epidemiological studies have revealed that noise exposure was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the exact nature of that association remains to be elucidated. The present study is designed to examine the effects of chronic noise exposure on the development of T2DM in combination with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in mice. Here we show that chronic noise exposure at 85 dB SPL (4 h /day, below the safety limit for occupational noise exposure) exaggerated multiple metabolic abnormalities induced by HFD in C57BL/6J male mice, including worsened glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, noise exposure exhibited a paradoxical impact on fat accumulation and circulating levels of free fatty acid, indicating a potential stimulating effect of noise on lipolysis. These results provide first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4b198f0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijie Liu, Yi Huang, Cong Fang, Hongyu Zhang, Jing Yang, Chuanying Xuan, Fanfan Wang, Haiying Lu, Shuangfeng Cao, Yongfang Wang, Shengwei Li, Jun Sha, Mingming Zha, Min Guo, Jian Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>76a5e3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Remy J.

Our observations indicate that NDC80, rather than through biased diffusion, tracks depolymerizing microtubules by harnessing force generated during microtubule disassembly.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36764</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162aa589577:14fe33c:9aea0a7d</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36764</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36764</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1523232000000</published><author><name>m.dogterom@tudelft.nl (Andrea Musacchio)</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523276354935</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022669?af=R</originId><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>e74bc2e7</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><title>Assessment of interaction-strength interpolation formulas for gold and silver clusters</title><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b30:7c9981b6</id><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022669?af=R</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022669?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><published>1522648010000</published><author><name>Sara Giarrusso</name></author><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523085743269</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/13.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Scientific Community, Science and Policy</item></keywords><title>University is quick to disclose misconduct</title><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>f75e7111</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529860:34f43e70</id><published>1522950073000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>McCook, A., Retraction Watch</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/13?rss=1</link><engagement>23</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.43</engagementRate><crawled>1522951977478</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193848</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193848</originId><updated>1520888400000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by João Cavaleiro Rufo, Inês Paciência, Diana Silva, Carla Martins, Joana Madureira, Eduardo de Oliveira Fernandes, Patrícia Padrão, Pedro Moreira, Luís Delgado, André Moreira&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Endurance swimming exercises coupled to disinfection by-products exposure has been associated with increased airways dysfunction and neurogenic inflammation in elite swimmers. However, the impact of swimming pool exposure at a recreational level on autonomic activity has never been explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how swimming pool attendance is influencing lung and autonomic function in school-aged children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 858 children enrolled a cross sectional survey. Spirometry and airway reversibility to beta-2 agonist, skin-prick-tests and exhaled nitric oxide measurements were performed. Pupillometry was used to evaluate autonomic nervous function. Children were classified as current swimmers (CS), past swimmers (PS) and non-swimmers (NS), according to the amount of swimming practice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Current swimmers group had significantly lower maximum and average pupil constriction velocities when compared to both PS and NS groups (3.8 and 5.1 vs 3.9 and 5.3 vs 4.0 and 5.4 mm/s, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, affinity to the beta-2 agonist and levels of exhaled nitric oxide were significantly higher in CS when compared to NS (70 vs 60 mL and 12 vs 10 ppb, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively). A non-significant trend for a higher risk of asthma, atopic eczema and allergic rhinitis was found with more years of swimming practice, particularly in atopic individuals (β = 1.12, 1.40 and 1.31, respectively). After case-case analysis, it was possible to observe that results were not influenced by the inclusion of individuals with asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Concluding, swimming pool attendance appears to be associated with autonomic changes and increased baseline airway smooth muscle constriction even in children without asthma.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c0b869de</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by João Cavaleiro Rufo, Inês Paciência, Diana Silva, Carla Martins, Joana Madureira, Eduardo de Oliveira Fernandes, Patrícia Padrão, Pedro Moreira, Luís Delgado, André Moreira&lt;/p&gt;

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>840f90f3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;While silent brain infarcts (SBIs) in screened cohorts are associated with risk of symptomatic stroke and dementia, the clinical significance of incidentally discovered SBIs (id-SBIs) is unknown.

Background &lt;p&gt;While silent brain infarcts (SBIs) in screened cohorts are associated with risk of symptomatic stroke and dementia, the clinical significance of incidentally discovered SBIs (id-SBIs) is unknown.

Cabbage (&lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L. var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt;), an important vegetable crop in the Brassicaceae family, is economically important worldwide. In the process of hybrid seed production, Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility (OguCMS), controlled by the mitochondrial gene &lt;i&gt;orf138&lt;/i&gt;, has been extensively used for cabbage hybrid production with complete and stable male sterility. To identify the critical genes and pathways involved in the sterility and to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, the anther of OguCMS line R2P2CMS and the fertile line R2P2 were used for RNA-seq and iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation) proteome analysis. RNA-seq analysis generated 13,037,109 to 13,066,594 SE50-clean reads, from the sterile and fertile lines, which were assembled into 36,890 unigenes. Among them, 1,323 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, consisting of 307 up- and 1016 down-regulated genes. For ITRAQ analysis, a total of 7,147 unique proteins were identified, and 833 were differentially expressed including 538 up- and 295 down-regulated proteins. These were mainly annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome and mRNA surveillance pathways. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified 22 and 70 genes with the same and opposite expression profiles, respectively. Using KEGG analysis of DEGs, gibberellin mediated signaling pathways regulating tapetum programmed cell death and four different pathways involved in sporopollenin synthesis were identified. Secretion and translocation of the sporopollenin precursors were identified, and the key genes participating in these pathways were all significantly down-regulated in R2P2CMS. Light and transmission electron (TE) microscopy revealed fat abnormal tapetum rather than vacuolization and degradation at the tetrad and microspore stages of the OguCMS line.

Strategic purchasing is an essential health financing function. This paper compares the strategic purchasing practices of Thailand’s two tax-financed health insurance schemes, the Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS), and identifies factors contributing to successful universal health coverage outcomes by analysing the relationships between the purchaser and government, providers and members. The study uses a cross-sectional mixed-methods design, including document review and interviews with 56 key informants. The Comptroller General Department (CGD) of Ministry of Finance manages CSMBS as one among civil servant welfare programmes. Their purchasing is passive. Fee for service payment for outpatient care has resulted in rapid cost escalation and overspending of their annual budget. In contrast, National Health Security Office (NHSO) manages purchasing for UCS, which undertakes a range of strategic purchasing actions, including applying closed ended provider payment, promoting primary healthcare’s gate keeping functions, exercising collective purchasing power and engaging views of members in decision making process. This difference in purchasing arrangements resulted in expenditure per CSMBS member being 4 times higher than UCS in 2014. The governance of the purchaser organization, the design of the purchasing arrangements including incentives and use of information, and the institutional capacities to implement purchasing functions are essential for effective strategic purchasing which can improve health system efficiency as a whole.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9ee1557c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Walaiporn Patcharanarumol, Warisa Panichkriangkrai, Angkana Sommanuttaweechai, Kara Hanson, Yaowaluk Wanwong, Viroj Tangcharoensathien&lt;/p&gt;

Despite evidence that the ability to taste is weakened by obesity and can be rescued with weight loss intervention, few studies have investigated the molecular effects of obesity on the taste system. Taste bud cells undergo continual turnover even in adulthood, exhibiting an average life span of only a few weeks, tightly controlled by a balance of proliferation and cell death. Recent data reveal that an acute inflammation event can alter this balance. We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>beb3cc5a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Kaufman, Ezen Choo, Anna Koh, Robin Dando&lt;/p&gt;

We demonstrate that chronic low-grade inflammation brought on by obesity reduces the number of taste buds in gustatory tissues of mice—and is likely the cause of taste dysfunction seen in obese populations—by upsetting this balance of renewal and cell death.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OTfX7eySHIY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Inflammation arising from obesity reduces taste bud abundance and inhibits renewal</title><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1624482964b:1c8565b:76251cdd</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2001959</link><author><name>Andrew Kaufman</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/OTfX7eySHIY/article</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><published>1521579600000</published><recrawled>1521573302873</recrawled><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001959</href></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521567831627</crawled></item><item><engagement>55</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The role of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in control of the intestinal stem-cell niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in control of the intestinal stem-cell niche, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03638-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Colony stimulating factor 1 controls the growth and differentiation of macrophages.

&lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, due to its short lipooligosaccharide structure, is generally more sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of some fatty acids than most other Gram negative bacteria. This supports recent development of a fatty acid-based potential treatment for gonococcal infections, particularly ophthalmia neonatorum. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; genome contains genes for fatty acid resistance. In this study, the potential for genomic mutations that could lead to resistance to this potential new treatment were investigated. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; strain NCCP11945 was repeatedly passaged on growth media containing a sub-lethal concentration of fatty acid myristic acid and monoglyceride monocaprin. Cultures were re-sequenced and assessed for changes in minimum inhibitory concentration. Of note, monocaprin grown cultures developed a mutation in transcription factor gene &lt;i&gt;dksA&lt;/i&gt;, which suppresses molecular chaperone DnaK and may be involved in the stress response. The minimum inhibitory concentration after exposure to monocaprin showed a modest two-fold change. The results of this study suggest that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; cannot readily evolve resistance that will impact treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum with monocaprin.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5cd25554</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin P.

Feed costs account for over 70% of the annual expenditures in cow/calf production. During the production year the cow uses nutrients to support conceptus growth, milk production, work (grazing and locomotion), and maintenance requirements. The majority of the nutrients are used to support maintenance. Substrate cycling has been identified as one of the major contributors toward energy expenditure associated with maintenance in mature cows. The objective of this study was to determine whether beef cows that differ in the efficiency of weight gain differ in the relative abundance of transcripts for metabolic regulation in adipose tissue. Mature beef cows were subjected to feed restriction followed by ad libitum feed. Adipose tissue from twelve cows with high (n = 6) and low (n = 6) gain based on growth performance during the ad libitum feeding period was evaluated for transcriptome expression differences. A total of 496 genes were differentially expressed and passed Bonferroni correction for the animals with greater gain between restriction and realimentation and 491 genes were differentially expressed among animals with lesser gains between feed restriction and realimentation. Of these two differentially expressed gene lists, 144 genes were common between animals with greater and those with lesser gain. Enriched biological processes included the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, respiratory electron transport chain and fatty acid metabolic processes. Specific to adipose tissue of low gaining animals was glycolysis and to high gain animals was coenzyme, steroid, cellular amino acid, nitrogen compound metabolic processes, and sensory perception. The oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways were commonly associated with the high gain animals between feed restriction and realimentation, as well as with the low gaining animals between the two time points. Unique to the high gaining animals were valine degradation and LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function pathways. In this discovery study, genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation pathways appear to be critical to mature cows during times of abundant feed after feed restriction.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>887574c9</fingerprint><title>Differential transcript abundance in adipose tissue of mature beef cows during feed restriction and realimentation</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d58:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hannah Crocker Cunningham, Kristi M.

Our understanding on the importance of viral lysis in the functioning of tropical estuarine ecosystem is limited. This study examines viral infection of prokaryotes and subsequent lysis of cells belonging to different morphotypes across a salinity gradient in monsoon driven estuarine ecosystem (Cochin estuary, India). High standing stock of viruses and prokaryotes accompanied by lytic infection rates in the euryhaline/mesohaline region of the estuary suggests salinity to have an influential role in driving interactions between prokaryotes and viruses. High prokaryotic mortality rates, up to 42% of prokaryote population in the pre-monsoon season is further substantiated by a high virus to prokaryote ratio (VPR), suggesting that maintenance of a high number of viruses is dependent on the most active fraction of bacterioplankton. Although myoviruses were the dominant viral morphotype (mean = 43%) throughout the study period, there was significant variation among prokaryotic morphotypes susceptible to viral infection. Among them, the viral infected short rod prokaryote morphotype with lower burst estimates (mean = 18 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was dominant (35%) in the dry seasons whereas a substantial increase in cocci forms (30%) infected by viruses with high burst size (mean = 31 viruses prokaryote&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) was evident during the monsoon season. Such preferential infections of prokaryotic morphopopulations with respect to seasons can have a strong and variable impact on the carbon and energy flow in this tropical ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>85a5d3b8</fingerprint><title>Differential impact of lytic viruses on prokaryotic morphopopulations in a tropical estuarine system (Cochin estuary, India)</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d53:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vijayan Jasna, Angia Sriram Pradeep Ram, Ammini Parvathi, Telesphore Sime-Ngando&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, an increasing number of studies has investigated majority influence in nonhuman animals. However, due to both terminological and methodological issues, evidence for conformity in nonhuman animals is scarce and controversial. Preliminary evidence suggests that wild birds, wild monkeys, and fish show conformity, that is, forgoing personal information in order to copy the majority. By contrast, chimpanzees seem to lack this tendency. The present study is the first to examine whether dogs (&lt;i&gt;Canis familiaris)&lt;/i&gt; show conformity. Specifically, we tested whether dogs conform to a majority of conspecifics rather than stick to what they have previously learned. After dogs had acquired a behavioral preference via training (i.e., shaping), they were confronted with counter-preferential behavior of either no, one or three conspecifics. Traditional frequentist analyses show that the dogs’ behavior did not differ significantly between the three conditions. Complementary Bayesian analyses suggest that our data provide moderate evidence for the null hypothesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that dogs stick to what they have learned rather than conform to the counter-preferential behavior of others. We discuss the possible statistical and methodological limitations of this finding. Furthermore, we take a functional perspective on conformity and discuss under which circumstances dogs might show conformity after all.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>eb50a6a4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Markus Germar, Amira Sultan, Juliane Kaminski, Andreas Mojzisch&lt;/p&gt;

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>608c2992</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</description><title>Predicting protein complexes using a supervised learning method combined with local structural information</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88ef:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521493200000</published><author><name>Yadong Dong</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><engagement>187</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03445-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Scientists hope to learn what makes a ‘typical’ solar system from the European Space Agency’s €450-million probe.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3b72e644</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03445-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Scientists hope to learn what makes a ‘typical’ solar system from the European Space Agency’s €450-million probe.</description><title>First space mission dedicated to exoplanet atmospheres gets green light</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162448dd1f2:30ca44e:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</link><published>1521529200000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03445-5</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03445-5/d41586-018-03445-5_15548832.jpg</url><height>576</height></visual><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><unread>False</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521568567794</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194589</originId><updated>1521838800000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

Lifestyle interventions in type 2 diabetes (DM2) prevention implementation studies can be effective and lasting. Long-term weight loss maintenance enhances the intervention effect through a significant decrease in diabetes incidence over time. Our objective was to identify factors predicting long-term successful weight reduction maintenance achieved during a DM2 prevention program in patients with high DM2 risk in primary health care. Study participants (n = 263), middle-aged, slightly obese with baseline increased DM2 risk (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC)&gt;14), but no diabetes were invited to receive 11 lifestyle counselling sessions, guided physical activity sessions and motivational support during 10-months. The study participants had three clinical examinations during the study (baseline, one and three years). Stepwise regression analysis was used to determine demographic, clinical, and lifestyle predictors of weight reduction maintenance two years after the discontinuation of the intervention. Out of 105 patients who completed all three examinations (baseline age 56.6 (standard deviation (SD) = 10.7), body mass index 31.1 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (SD = 4.9), FINDRISC 18.6 (SD = 3.1)), 73 patients (70%) showed weight loss during the intervention (mean weight loss 4.2 kg, SD = 5.1). The total weight loss achieved in the maintainers (27 of 73 study participants) two years after the intervention had finished was 6.54 kg (4.47 kg+2.0 kg). The non-maintainers, on the other hand, returned to their initial weight at the start of the intervention (+0.21 kg). In multivariable analysis baseline history of increased glucose (odds ratio (OR) = 3.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–13.6) and reduction of total fat in diet during follow-up (OR = 4.3; 95% CI 1.5–12.2) were independent predictors of successful weight loss. Further studies exploring predictors of weight loss maintenance in diabetes prevention are needed to help health care providers to redesign interventions and improve long-term outcomes of real life interventions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a15c8eea</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aleksandra Gilis-Januszewska, Noël C.

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</description><title>Visualizing the Bayesian 2-test case: The effect of tree diagrams on medical decision making</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f21:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522184400000</published><author><name>Karin Binder</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522172707031</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194993</originId><updated>1522098000000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;
The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC. Personalized medicine may be needed for different histological types of EOC because of their different outcomes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9df5e11f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin-Chau Chang, Chih-Fen Huang, Mei-Shu Lai, Li-Jiuan Shen, Fe-Lin Lin Wu, Wen-Fang Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Interactions between DNA and proteins located in the cell nucleus play an important role in controlling physiological processes by specifying, augmenting and regulating context-specific transcription events. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a widely used methodology to study DNA-protein interactions and has been successfully used in various cell types for over three decades. More recently, by combining ChIP with genomic screening technologies and Next Generation Sequencing (e.g. ChIP-seq), it has become possible to profile DNA-protein interactions (including covalent histone modifications) across entire genomes. However, the applicability of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq has rarely been extended to non-model species because of a number of technical challenges. Here we report a method that can be used to identify genome wide covalent histone modifications in a group of non-model fruit fly species (Diptera: Tephritidae). The method was developed by testing and refining protocols that have been used in model organisms, including &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that this method is suitable for a group of economically important pest fruit fly species, viz., &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera dorsalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ceratitis capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zeugodacus cucurbitae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bactrocera tryoni&lt;/i&gt;. We also report an example ChIP-seq dataset for &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tryoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing evidence for histone modifications in the genome of a tephritid fruit fly for the first time. Since tephritids are major agricultural pests globally, this methodology will be a valuable resource to study taxa-specific evolutionary questions and to assist with pest management. It also provides a basis for researchers working with other non-model species to undertake genome wide DNA-protein interaction studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>fd9667ce</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kumaran Nagalingam, Michał T.

European plum (&lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an ancient domesticated species cultivated in temperate areas worldwide whose genetic structure has been scarcely analyzed to date. In this study, a broad representation of Spanish European plum germplasm collected in Northeastern Spain and a representative set of reference cultivars were compared using nuclear and chloroplast markers. The number of alleles per locus detected with the SSR markers ranged from 8 to 39, with an average of 23.4 alleles, and 8 haplotypes were identified. Bayesian model-based clustering, minimum spanning networks, and the analysis of molecular variance showed the existence of a hierarchical structure. At the first level, two genetic groups were found, one containing ‘Reine Claude’ type reference cultivars altogether with ca. 25% of local genotypes, and a second one much more diverse. This latter group split in two groups, one containing most (ca. 70%) local genotypes and some old Spanish and French reference cultivars, whereas the other included 24 reference cultivars and only six local genotypes. A third partition level allowed a significant finer delineation into five groups. As a whole, the genetic structure of European plum from Northeastern Spain was shown to be complex and conditioned by a geographical proximity factor. This study not only contributes to genetic conservation and breeding for this species at the national level, but also supports the relevance of undertaking similar tasks of collection and characterization in other unexplored areas. Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ec946bba</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jorge Urrestarazu, Pilar Errea, Carlos Miranda, Luis G.

Moreover, this kind of research could lead to future coordinated actions for the examination of the whole European plum diversity, to define conservation strategies, and could be used to better understand the genetic control of traits of horticultural interest through association mapping.</description><title>Genetic diversity of Spanish &amp;lt;i&gt;Prunus domestica L&amp;lt;/i&gt;. germplasm reveals a complex genetic structure underlying</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529a:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195591</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1523307600000</published><author><name>Jorge Urrestarazu</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523295737183</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</originId><updated>1522789200000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>993d9672</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human breast cancer and is a marker for poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Transplantation of p53 null mouse mammary epithelium into syngeneic wild-type mice leads to normal mammary gland development followed by spontaneous mammary tumors that recapitulate many of the phenotypic, molecular and genetic features of human breast cancer. Transient exposure of p53 null mice to the anti-estrogen, tamoxifen leads to sustained and robust protection against tumor development. However the mechanism underlying this anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that transient exposure to tamoxifen leads to a reduction in mammary ductal side-branching and epithelial cell proliferation after tamoxifen withdrawal. Global gene expression analysis showed that transient tamoxifen exposure leads to persistent changes in the expression of a subset of estrogen regulated gene signatures in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Among these was the protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt;). We show that &lt;i&gt;Ptpn5&lt;/i&gt; is a novel tamoxifen regulated target gene which is upregulated in MECs after transient tamoxifen exposure and displays tumor suppressor activity in human breast cancer cells. Further, PTPN5 expression is strongly associated with good clinical outcome in tamoxifen treated human breast cancer patients suggesting that PTPN5 may represent a novel biomarker of tamoxifen response in human breast cancer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>33265d5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Murugesan Palaniappan, David Edwards, Chad J.

Acceptable internal consistency reliabilities, ranging from .81 to .94, were found in this sample. Approximate fit indices suggest that a correlated six first-order factor model best describes the data in contrast to theoretical considerations suggesting that a six factor model with two correlated superordinate factors (i.e., statistics anxiety and attitudes toward statistics) best describes the data.

Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction following left ventricular (LV) failure is associated with poor prognosis. RV remodeling is thought initiated by the increase in the afterload of RV due to secondary pulmonary hypertension (PH) to impaired LV function; however, RV molecular changes might occur in earlier stages of the disease. cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)-phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, widely used to treat PH through their pulmonary vasorelaxation properties, have shown direct cardiac benefits, but their impacts on the RV in LV diseases are not fully determined. Here we show that RV molecular alterations occur early in the absence of RV hemodynamic changes during LV pressure-overload and are ameliorated by PDE5 inhibition. Two-day moderate LV pressure-overload (transverse aortic constriction) neither altered RV pressure/ function nor RV weight in mice, while it induced only mild LV hypertrophy. Importantly, pathological molecular features were already induced in the RV free wall myocardium, including up-regulation of gene markers for hypertrophy and inflammation, and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and calcineurin. Concomitant PDE5 inhibition (sildenafil) prevented induction of such pathological genes and activation of ERK and calcineurin in the RV as well as in the LV. Importantly, dexamethasone also prevented these RV molecular changes, similarly to sildenafil treatment. These results suggest the contributory role of inflammation to the early pathological interventricular interaction between RV and LV. The current study provides the first evidence for the novel early molecular cross-talk between RV and LV, preceding RV hemodynamic changes in LV disease, and supports the therapeutic strategy of enhancing cGMP signaling pathway to treat heart diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>727a0802</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yousuke Imai, Taro Kariya, Masaki Iwakiri, Yoshitsugu Yamada, Eiki Takimoto&lt;/p&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a4e34836</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

During online speech processing, our brain tracks the acoustic fluctuations in speech at different timescales. Previous research has focused on generic timescales (for example, delta or theta bands) that are assumed to map onto linguistic features such as prosody or syllables. However, given the high intersubject variability in speaking patterns, such a generic association between the timescales of brain activity and speech properties can be ambiguous. Here, we analyse speech tracking in source-localised magnetoencephalographic data by directly focusing on timescales extracted from statistical regularities in our speech material. This revealed widespread significant tracking at the timescales of phrases (0.6–1.3 Hz), words (1.8–3 Hz), syllables (2.8–4.8 Hz), and phonemes (8–12.4 Hz). Importantly, when examining its perceptual relevance, we found stronger tracking for correctly comprehended trials in the left premotor (PM) cortex at the phrasal scale as well as in left middle temporal cortex at the word scale. Control analyses using generic bands confirmed that these effects were specific to the speech regularities in our stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the phase at the phrasal timescale coupled to power at beta frequency (13–30 Hz) in motor areas. This cross-frequency coupling presumably reflects top-down temporal prediction in ongoing speech perception. Together, our results reveal specific functional and perceptually relevant roles of distinct tracking and cross-frequency processes along the auditory–motor pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3m9xJbh7ayE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bb53183c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anne Keitel, Joachim Gross, Christoph Kayser&lt;/p&gt;

Spatial heterogeneity in the strength or agents of selection can lead to geographic variation in ecologically important phenotypes. Many dendrobatid frogs sequester alkaloid toxins from their diets and often exhibit fixed mutations at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4, a voltage-gated sodium ion channel associated with alkaloid toxin resistance. Yet previous studies have noted an absence of resistance mutations in individuals from several species known to sequester alkaloid toxins, suggesting possible intraspecific variation for alkaloid resistance in these species. Toxicity and alkaloid profiles vary substantially between populations in several poison frog species (genus &lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&lt;/i&gt;) and are correlated with variation in a suite of related traits such as aposematic coloration. If resistance mutations are costly, due to alterations of channel gating properties, we expect that low toxicity populations will have reduced frequencies and potentially even the loss of resistance alleles. Here, we examine whether intraspecific variation in toxicity in three dendrobatid frogs is associated with intraspecific variation in alleles conferring toxin resistance. Specifically, we examine two species that display marked variation in toxicity throughout their native ranges (&lt;i&gt;Dendrobates pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granuliferus&lt;/i&gt;) and one species with reduced toxicity in its introduced range (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auratus&lt;/i&gt;). However, we find no evidence for population-level variation in alkaloid resistance at Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.4. In fact, contrary to previous studies, we found that alkaloid resistance alleles were not absent in any populations of these species. All three species exhibit fixed alkaloid resistance mutations throughout their ranges, suggesting that these mutations are maintained even when alkaloid sequestration is substantially reduced.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>81bbb08a</fingerprint><title>Sodium ion channel alkaloid resistance does not vary with toxicity in aposematic &amp;lt;i&gt;Dendrobates&amp;lt;/i&gt; poison frogs: An examination of correlated trait evolution</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d68:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD patients. Systemic inflammation associated with COPD, is often hypothesised as a causal factor. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases play a key role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of COPD and atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study sought to evaluate the effects of losmapimod, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor, on vascular inflammation and endothelial function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with systemic inflammation (defined by plasma fibrinogen &gt;2·8g/l).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase II trial that recruited COPD patients with plasma fibrinogen &gt;2.8g/l. Participants were randomly assigned by an online program to losmapimod 7·5mg or placebo tablets twice daily for 16 weeks.

Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We screened 160 patients, of whom, 36 and 37 were randomised to losmapimod or placebo. The treatment effect of losmapimod compared to placebo was not significant, at -0·05 for TBR (95% CI: -0·17, 0·07), p = 0·42, and +0·40% for FMD (95% CI: -1·66, 2·47), p = 0·70. The frequency of adverse events reported was similar in both treatment groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this plasma fibrinogen-enriched study, losmapimod had no effect on arterial inflammation and endothelial function at 16 weeks of treatment, although it was well tolerated with no significant safety concerns.

The impact of agricultural practices and soil management on the communities of arthropods living in the agricultural landscape is acknowledged as a critical issue by the literature, and it needs to be better investigated to improve the ecological sustainability of agriculture. In the present study, we aimed to study how soil management affect carabid species distribution in one of the most typical agroecosystem of the Mediterranean region, i.e. the olive grove. In South Italy olive plantations feature different types of soil management, from tillage to half- or full-cover cropping. Species distribution has been examined for a total of 10,189 individuals and 62 species collected from 17 sites. Notably from our analysis we have observed that three factors (climax vegetation, soil features and soil management) explained half of the data variability. The composition of species groupings mirrors both bioclimatic conditions (climax vegetation) and soil features, especially watering, while soil management affects the species distribution, with different intensity from site to site. Eleven species have been recognized as the most abundant in the different facets of the studied olive groves and consequently designated as characteristics of the olive agroecosystem. The species traits of the sampled species have been weighted for a compelling evaluation of the effects of agricultural management on biodiversity, showing uniform traits distribution when coping with the ecological factors that characterize the different plantation facets. We have found that carabid beetles can be used as model organisms for studying the effects of agricultural practices. Our study suggests that the interaction of man-induced trasformation with the natural background of the olive agroecosystem may be difficult to disentangle, so that such complexity must be taken into account when carabid beetles are expected to provide an ecosystem service for good agricultural practices.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ee6e2a3c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto Pizzolotto, Antonio Mazzei, Teresa Bonacci, Stefano Scalercio, Nino Iannotta, Pietro Brandmayr&lt;/p&gt;

Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear whether immune protection wanes or whether the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from six studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 years (95% confidence interval, 16 to 51 years) after vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>7fa8e306</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

Often these transcripts are processed (spliced, capped, polyadenylated) and some are known to have important biological functions. However, most lncRNAs have unknown or poorly understood functions. Nevertheless, because of their potential role in cancer, lncRNAs are receiving a lot of attention, and the need for computational tools to predict their possible mechanisms of action is more than ever. Fundamentally, most of the known lncRNA mechanisms involve RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. Through accurate predictions of each kind of interaction and integration of these predictions, it is possible to elucidate potential mechanisms for a given lncRNA. Approach: Here we introduce MechRNA, a pipeline for corroborating RNA-RNA interaction prediction and protein binding prediction for identifying possible lncRNA mechanisms involving specific targets or on a transcriptome-wide scale. The first stage uses a version of IntaRNA2 with added functionality for efficient prediction of RNA-RNA interactions with very long input sequences, allowing for large-scale analysis of lncRNA interactions with little or no loss of optimality. The second stage integrates protein binding information pre-computed by GraphProt, for both the lncRNA and the target. The final stage involves inferring the most likely mechanism for each lncRNA/target pair. This is achieved by generating candidate mechanisms from the predicted interactions, the relative locations of these interactions and correlation data, followed by selection of the most likely mechanistic explanation using a combined p-value. Results: We applied MechRNA on a number of recently identified cancer-related lncRNAs (PCAT1, PCAT29, ARLnc1) and also on two well-studied lncRNAs (PCA3 and 7SL). This led to the identification of hundreds of high confidence potential targets for each lncRNA and corresponding mechanisms. These predictions include the known competitive mechanism of 7SL with HuR for binding on the tumor suppressor TP53, as well as mechanisms expanding what is known about PCAT1 and ARLn1 and their targets BRCA2 and AR, respectively. For PCAT1-BRCA2, the mechanism involves competitive binding with HuR, which we confirmed using HuR immunoprecipitation assays.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f37a8728</fingerprint><description>Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not get translated into proteins.

One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states.

Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures.

Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes.

One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states.

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a0e64413</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

Perceived time constraints have been highlighted in sociological studies as representing a core issue in determining quality of life. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that gender inequalities regarding insufficiency of time play a role in the development of overweight and obesity in adults. The study used baseline data (2008–2010) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), which monitors a cohort of 15,105 civil servants of 35 to 74 years of age. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure due to professional and domestic duties, as detailed in a structured questionnaire, comprised the main exposure variable. The outcome variable was overweight/obesity measured according to body mass index. Prevalence ratios were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. A greater proportion of women compared to men reported insufficient time for personal care and leisure (34.5% versus 23.8%, respectively). The prevalence of overweight was greater in men, while obesity was more common in women. Insufficient time for personal care and leisure was associated with overweight (PR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.04–1.61) and obesity (PR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.28–2.12) only in women working over 40 hours/week. No significant association was found for males. These results suggest that the length of the working week influences factors underlying weight gain, possibly issues linked to behavior and/or stress mechanisms. The fact that such an association was restricted to women suggests that the results originate from gender inequalities involving relationships between time and health. The findings of this study provide data on which to base public policies aimed at encouraging the redistribution of domestic responsibilities in the direction of gender equity, as well as macrosocial policies such as providing public schools for workers’ children.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>85f03dc5</fingerprint><title>Gender, time use and overweight and obesity in adults: Results of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d5f:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karina Araujo Pinto, Rosane Harter Griep, Lucia Rotenberg, Maria da Conceição Chagas Almeida, Rosane Sousa Barreto, Estela M.

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ff4d936c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</description><title>Identification of aaNAT5b as a spermine N-acetyltransferase in the mosquito, &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88fe:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194499</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521493200000</published><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195366</originId><updated>1522962000000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;
The waste of commonly used medicines is known to contaminate freshwater ecosystems. Pharmaceuticals can be toxic, mutagenic, or modifying to freshwater organisms even at low concentrations if consider their permanent presence in the environment. Chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer, and in particular alkylating agents, contribute significantly to this form of pollution, the latter introducing cytotoxic and/or mutagenic lesions to the DNA and RNA of organisms which can be disruptive to their cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide (CP) on &lt;i&gt;Daphnia magna&lt;/i&gt; clones. We evaluated the life history parameters and protein profiles of this crustacean following exposure to environmentally relevant CP concentration of 10 ng L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Even at this low concentration, the alkylating agent caused modification of the life history parameters and proteome profile of the &lt;i&gt;Daphnia&lt;/i&gt;. These changes were clone-specific and involved growth rate, age at first reproduction, neonate number, and proteins related to cell cycle and redox state regulation. The disturbance caused by pharmaceuticals contaminating freshwater ecosystem is probably weaker and unlikely to be cytotoxic in character due to the high dilution of these substances in the water. However, our results indicate that prolonged exposure of organisms to these toxins may lead to modifications on the organismal and molecular levels with unpredictable significance for the entire ecosystem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d431fe05</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Grzesiuk, Damian Mielecki, Tomasz Pilżys, Damian Garbicz, Michał Marcinkowski, Elżbieta Grzesiuk&lt;/p&gt;

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

When some individuals are screen-detected before the beginning of the study, but otherwise would have been diagnosed symptomatically during the study, this results in different case-ascertainment probabilities among screened and unscreened participants, referred to here as lead-time-biased case-ascertainment (LTBCA). In fact, this issue can arise even in risk-factor studies nested within a randomized screening trial; even though the screening intervention is randomly allocated to trial arms, there is no randomization to potential risk-factors and uptake of screening can differ by risk-factor strata. Under the assumptions that neither screening nor the risk factor affects underlying incidence and no other forms of bias operate, we simulate and compare the underlying cumulative incidence and that observed in the study due to LTBCA. The example used will be constructed from the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial. The derived mathematical model is applied to simulating two nested studies to evaluate the potential for screening bias in observational lung cancer studies. Because of differential screening under plausible assumptions about preclinical incidence and duration, the simulations presented here show that LTBCA due to chest x-ray screening can significantly increase the estimated risk of lung cancer due to smoking by 1% and 50%. Traditional adjustment methods cannot account for this bias, as the influence screening has on observational study estimates involves events outside of the study observation window (enrollment and follow-up) that change eligibility for potential participants, thus biasing case ascertainment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>c5e60a84</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rick J.

Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death.

This is one of those questions that improves on further inspection – or deteriorates, according to your point of view, because it just keeps on getting more complicated. For decades, there was no good answer at all, but then there was “It reduces signaling in the inflammation pathways”, followed by “OK, it seems to do that by decreasing this prostaglandin signaling molecule” and “Ah, it does that by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme in the pathway to make those”. Then we moved to “Hold it, there’s more than one cyclooxygenase”, which is how we ended up with the COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx, which led to “You know, the functions of these two are more complicated than we even thought”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on top of all these, there are clearly effects of NSAID drugs that have nothing to do with the COX enzymes at all. Blood clotting you can pretty much chalk up to the COX isoforms, but there are more things going on, and they’re very poorly defined. Which brings up a more general question: how do you ever know about all the things that a small-molecule drug might be doing in a living system? The answer is, you don’t. That’s not generally appreciated outside the biomedical professions, but it’s the truth. We don’t have some way to track things around and watch them interact at a molecule level through out a cell or an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. Mapping compound-protein interactions is a big part of chemical biology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b11639&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Woo lab at Harvard shows an attempt to track small molecules in just this way. It uses photoaffinity labeling, via the now-nearly-standard combination tag of a diazirine and an acetylene, which lets you form a covalent bond to (most) of the thing the molecule of interest is spending time next to, and on the back end of the process, it uses isotope-labeled tags on the acetylene-click-conjugation step to give the mass spec detection a much higher signal/noise. Just digging through the whole cellular proteome without the kind of validation that isotope tagging gives you is a tall order, but the deliberately-weird-mass-combination effect of the stable isotope tags moves things up out of the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three NSAIDs are given the treatment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen&quot;&gt;naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celecoxib&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; (Celebrex), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indometacin&quot;&gt;indomethacin&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a good spread of activity: naproxen hits both COX-1 and COX-2 pretty much equally, celecoxib is of course a COX-2 selective compound, and indomethacin is in a structurally distinct class that’s already known to have some other modes of action. &lt;em&gt;(Update:&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja408322b&quot;&gt; here’s work&lt;/a&gt; from another group on an alkyne-tagged aspirin derivative, which also interacts with a long list of cellular proteins).&lt;/em&gt; All the photolabel-derivatized compounds were still active against COX enzymes (albeit with somewhat lower affinity), and all of them could be displaced by the parent compounds in competition assays. All of them photo-labeled COX-2 in an &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiment, as they certainly should, and this experiment was used to validate the mass spec analysis methods for the whole-cell experiments. (For example, each of these compounds produces six or seven different photoadducts, depending on which nearby amino acid gets snagged by the reactive carbene that forms from the diazirene, and the group was able to see and account for all of these without difficulty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happens in cells? They tried the dosing/photolabeling experiment in Jurkat cells, along with experiments with photoactive negative control (non-NSAID) compounds. About 700 proteins were labeled in all, with quite a bit of overlap between the three NSAIDs (40% of them are hit by all three), and that figure alone should make a person stop and think a bit: &lt;em&gt;as simple and widely used a molecule as naproxen binds to hundreds of proteins well enough to photolabel them&lt;/em&gt;. No, we don’t know the details of what’s going on in there, do we? Admittedly, that’s at a high concentration (250 micromolar), but (1) patients take whopping doses of this stuff in the real world, and (2) the majority of these interactions also showed up at a 50 micromolar dose as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same set of experiments was also run in K562 cells, a leukemia line. In this case, there were 513 enriched protein targets and &lt;em&gt;only 206 of them overlapped&lt;/em&gt; with the set from the Jurkat cells. And that’s also something to think about – not only do small, well-known compounds like these interact with a long list of proteins, that list can change dramatically in different cell backgrounds. Only about 30% of the total list of proteins have ever been report to interact with any small molecules at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of these doesn’t show any particular compartmentalization effects in the cells; it pretty much tracks protein abundance across the cytoplasm, various organelles, nucleus and so on. A closer look at the proteins and their interaction sites can be found in the paper, but one thing worth mentioning is a “hot spot” in histone H2A, which is certainly not a target that anyone had been thinking about for NSAIDs, to my knowledge. Assigning all the specific sites of labeling across the proteome is still beyond current technology, although you can think of some experiments that would help narrow things down a lot (different protein digestion before the mass spec, and so on). But even at this level – which is more detailed than we’ve ever had for such compounds – there’s a lot to deal with here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you needed a reminder about just what a complicated mixing bowl we’re throwing our compounds into, here you go. The hope is that such techniques and the ungodly huge piles of data that they generate will help up build up a clearer picture of drug action. But what a picture that’s going to be!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>94f2e936</fingerprint><description>When you take an NSAID (naproxen, ibuprofen, aspirin, etc.), how does it work?

Heparan sulfate 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfotransferases (HS3STs) catalyze the final maturation step of heparan sulfates. Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biological processes have been described to be influenced by 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated motifs. A conflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 may exhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on the model used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare the consequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellular model. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhanced the proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, the colony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by the expression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between the three isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had the same functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt and NF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In line with these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant to cell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activity and support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss of their expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/or changes in the tumor environment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1c7c6408</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Hellec, Maxime Delos, Mathieu Carpentier, Agnès Denys, Fabrice Allain&lt;/p&gt;

Graphic warnings (GWs) on cigarette packs are widely used internationally with the aim of reducing smoking behavior. In the current study, we investigated whether GWs influence implicit evaluations of smoking, a potential moderator of smoking behavior, as measured with an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Results showed that viewing a GW did not produce more negative implicit evaluations of smoking for daily smokers, occasional smokers, or non-smokers, compared to viewing a text-only warning. If anything, effects were in the direction of evaluations of smoking being &lt;i&gt;more positive&lt;/i&gt; after certain participants (i.e., daily and occasional smokers) viewed a GW. We also did not find any beneficial effects of GWs on explicit evaluations of smoking. These results contrast with the observation that non-smokers and occasional smokers (but not daily smokers) believed that GWs would be more effective than the text-only warnings. We discuss implications and limitations of these findings and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of cigarette pack warnings on implicit evaluations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>15d944d9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pieter Van Dessel, Colin Tucker Smith, Jan De Houwer&lt;/p&gt;

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ad6de948</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas J.

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as click-worthy as a meta-pug—a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume—but it is crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research. We should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx20SHTzNfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>bdf14f2e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa Bero&lt;/p&gt;

Seizure clustering is a common and significant phenomenon in patients with epilepsy. The clustering of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) in animal models of epilepsy, including mouse pilocarpine models, has been reported. However, most studies have analyzed seizures for a short duration after the induction of status epilepticus (SE). In this study, we investigated the detailed characteristics of seizure clustering in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model for an extended duration by continuous 24/7 video-EEG monitoring. A seizure cluster was defined as the occurrence of one or more seizures per day for at least three consecutive days and at least five seizures during the cluster period. We analyzed the cluster duration, seizure-free period, cluster interval, and numbers of seizures within and outside the seizure clusters. The video-EEG monitoring began 84.5±33.7 days after the induction of SE and continued for 53.7±20.4 days. Every mouse displayed seizure clusters, and 97.0% of the seizures occurred within a cluster period. The seizure clusters were followed by long seizure-free periods of 16.3±6.8 days, showing a cyclic pattern. The SRSs also occurred in a grouped pattern within a day. We demonstrate that almost all seizures occur in clusters with a cyclic pattern in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. The seizure-free periods between clusters were long. These findings should be considered when performing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies using this animal model. Furthermore, this model might be appropriate for studying the unrevealed mechanism of ictogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>562867d1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jung-Ah Lim, Jangsup Moon, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin-Sun Jun, Byeongsu Park, Jung-Ick Byun, Jun-Sang Sunwoo, Kyung-Il Park, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Daejong Jeon, Kon Chu, Sang Kun Lee&lt;/p&gt;

reaction mechanisms without dynamics simulations. This modeling scheme uses a global optimization

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b2123d08</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Knowledge of tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes is substantially needed to assess the performance of national TB controls programs (NTPs). To date, the overall estimates of treatment outcomes have not been determined in Ethiopia. Therefore, this meta-analysis was undertaken to produce pooled estimates of TB treatment outcomes and to analyze the impact of prior anti-TB drug exposure and HIV co-infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Potentially relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and MEDLINE online databases. The unpublished studies have been retrieved from the grey literature through Google and Google Scholar. The pooled estimates were calculated using random effect model. The summary estimates were also presented using Forest plots and Tables. The outcome measures were successful and unsuccessful treatment outcomes. Patients who were cured or with completed treatment defined as successful treatment outcome and patients meeting the definition of death, defaulting and failure are considered as unsuccessfully treated cases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 34 studies are included for meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of successful TB treatment outcomes amounts to 83.7% (95% CI 81.1%–86.3%). Of successfully treated cases, 33.9% were cured and the remaining completed cases. Besides, among patients with unsuccessful treatment outcome, nearly 50% were dead and the rest were treatment failures and defaulters. Sub-group analysis shows that high treatment success rate was estimated in Afar; 88.9% (95% CI 83.8%–94.2%), followed by Oromia; 88.5% (95% CI 82.6%–94.5%) and Gambella; 86.1% (95% CI 84.4%–87.9%), whereas relatively poor treatment outcome was noted in Tigray; 20.0% (95% CI 2.1%–37.9%) and Amhara; 19.0% (95% CI 12.6%–25.5%). The unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was found to be higher among HIV/TB co-infected cases with an odds ratio of 1.98 (95%CI, 1.56–2.52) and re-treated cases with an odds ratio of 2.17 (95%CI, 1.55–3.03). The time trend was assessed from 2003 to 2016, but it shows insignificant variation with treatment outcome (P = 0.108).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The rate of successful treatment outcome in Ethiopia appears generally high, only slightly below the threshold suggested by the World Health Organization. History of tuberculosis treatment and HIV/TB co-infection were inversely associated with favorable treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e2bd8368</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Setegn Eshetie, Mucheye Gizachew, Animut Alebel, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

Patients who were cured or with completed treatment defined as successful treatment outcome and patients meeting the definition of death, defaulting and failure are considered as unsuccessfully treated cases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 34 studies are included for meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of successful TB treatment outcomes amounts to 83.7% (95% CI 81.1%–86.3%). Of successfully treated cases, 33.9% were cured and the remaining completed cases. Besides, among patients with unsuccessful treatment outcome, nearly 50% were dead and the rest were treatment failures and defaulters. Sub-group analysis shows that high treatment success rate was estimated in Afar; 88.9% (95% CI 83.8%–94.2%), followed by Oromia; 88.5% (95% CI 82.6%–94.5%) and Gambella; 86.1% (95% CI 84.4%–87.9%), whereas relatively poor treatment outcome was noted in Tigray; 20.0% (95% CI 2.1%–37.9%) and Amhara; 19.0% (95% CI 12.6%–25.5%). The unsuccessful TB treatment outcome was found to be higher among HIV/TB co-infected cases with an odds ratio of 1.98 (95%CI, 1.56–2.52) and re-treated cases with an odds ratio of 2.17 (95%CI, 1.55–3.03). The time trend was assessed from 2003 to 2016, but it shows insignificant variation with treatment outcome (P = 0.108).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The rate of successful treatment outcome in Ethiopia appears generally high, only slightly below the threshold suggested by the World Health Organization. History of tuberculosis treatment and HIV/TB co-infection were inversely associated with favorable treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Ethiopia from 2003 to 2016, and impact of HIV co-infection and prior drug exposure: A systematic review and meta-analysis</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8906:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194675</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194675</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521493200000</published><author><name>Setegn Eshetie</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>32</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521481331028</crawled></item><item><engagement>527</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02967-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A SpaceX rocket blows a hole in the atmosphere&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SpaceX rocket blows a hole in the atmosphere, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02967-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02967-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Launch-related rupture has the potential to disrupt navigation signals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>642ada94</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A SpaceX rocket blows a hole in the atmosphere&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A SpaceX rocket blows a hole in the atmosphere, Published online: 12 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02967-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02967-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Launch-related rupture has the potential to disrupt navigation signals.</description><title>A SpaceX rocket blows a hole in the atmosphere</title><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1621b1a2bb7:642191b:923c4a60</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02967-2</link><published>1520838000000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02967-2</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-02967-2/d41586-018-02967-2_15518894.jpg</url><height>576</height></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1520873122743</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195266</originId><updated>1522702800000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;A large number of programs have been implemented in many countries to increase the healthcare workforce recruitment in rural and remote areas. Rural early exposure programs for medical students have been shown to be effective strategies. However, no related studies have been reported before in China. This study was carried out to determine the association between medical students’ participation in rural clinical clerkships and their intentions to choose rural medical work after graduation from western medical schools in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on a two-stage random sampling method, the cross-sectional survey was carried out in ten western provinces in China. A brief questionnaire filled in by medical students was used for data collection. A total of 4278 medical students participated in the study. The response rate was approximately 90.34%. Pearson’s chi-squared tests and binary logistic regression analyses were performed for data analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Approximately 52.0% of medical students disclosed intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation. Only one in five participants had experience with a rural clinical clerkship. Rural clinical clerkships were significantly associated with medical students’ intentions to work in rural medical institutions (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.05–1.46); further analyses indicated that such clerkships only had a significant impact among the medical students with an urban background (OR: 2.10, 95%CI: 1.48–2.97). In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics, younger age, low level of parental education, majoring in general practice, and studying in low-level medical schools increased the odds of having intentions to engage in rural medical work among medical students; however, rural origins was the only positive univariate predictor. In addition, the predictors of intentions to choose rural medical work were different between medical students with a rural background and those with an urban background.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural clinical clerkship is likely to increase the odds of having intentions to work in rural medical institutions after graduation among medical students in western China, especially for those with an urban background. Related policy makers could consider developing compulsory rural clerkship programs and implement them among medical students to increase early rural exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f150cd78</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinlin Liu, Bin Zhu, Ying Mao&lt;/p&gt;

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings. However, tactile suppression was comparable between conditions arguing against the hypothesis that it frees capacities for processing other relevant visual signals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ba854dbd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Gertz, Katja Fiehler, Dimitris Voudouris&lt;/p&gt;

Young women (aged 15–24) who exchange sex for money or other support are among the highest risk groups for HIV acquisition, particularly in high prevalence settings. To prepare for introduction and evaluation of the DREAMS programme in Zimbabwe, which provides biomedical and social interventions to reduce adolescent girls’ and young women’s HIV vulnerability, we conducted a rapid needs assessment in 6 towns using a “social mapping” approach. In each site, we talked to adult sex workers and other key informants to identify locations where young women sell sex, followed by direct observation, group discussions and interviews. We collected data on socio-demographic characteristics of young women who sell sex, the structure and organisation of their sexual exchanges, interactions with each other and adult sex workers, and engagement with health services. Over a two-week period, we developed a “social map” for each study site, identifying similarities and differences across contexts and their implications for programming and research. Similarities include the concentration of younger women in street-based venues in town centres, their conflict with older sex workers due to competition for clients and acceptance of lower payments, and reluctance to attend existing services. Key differences were found in the 4 university towns included in our sample, where female students participate in diverse forms of sexual exchange but do not identify themselves as selling sex. In smaller towns where illegal gold panning or trucking routes were found, young women migrated in from surrounding rural areas specifically to sell sex. Young women who sell sex are different from each other, and do not work with or attend the same services as adult sex workers. Our findings are being used to inform appropriate intervention activities targeting these vulnerable young women, and to identify effective strategies for recruiting them into the DREAMS process and impact evaluations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>9f37edae</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tarisai Chiyaka, Phillis Mushati, Bernadette Hensen, Sungai Chabata, James R.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain various amounts of dimeric IgG complexes. Current insights into the possible biological activities of these dimers remain controversial, and both immunemodulating and immune-activating effects have been reported. Here, we analyzed the putative immune-activating effects of dimers isolated from IVIg.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were purified by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) and tested for the ability to induce neutrophil degranulation in vitro.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Dimers isolated from IVIg were found to be incapable of inducing in vitro neutrophil degranulation or complement activation, even at concentrations exceeding those expected to be reached upon administration in patients. These results depend on the removal of artefactual activation by using 0.1 micron filtration and the use of poloxamer to prevent adsorption of IgG onto the solid phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The data suggest dimeric IgG found in IVIg may bind to Fc-receptors without causing activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>99668730</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iwan Kustiawan, Ninotska I.

These results depend on the removal of artefactual activation by using 0.1 micron filtration and the use of poloxamer to prevent adsorption of IgG onto the solid phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The data suggest dimeric IgG found in IVIg may bind to Fc-receptors without causing activation.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Dimeric IgG complexes from IVIg are incapable of inducing &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; neutrophil degranulation or complement activation</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c2:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1523394000000</published><author><name>Iwan Kustiawan</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523382126889</crawled></item><item><engagement>13</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23376-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23376-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23376-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vrTMebE3Qfk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>24141d9c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23376-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23376-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vrTMebE3Qfk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Operating length and velocity of human vastus lateralis muscle during walking and running</title><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1624d36041a:3e23ce9:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23376-5</link><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23376-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23376_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>157</height></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vrTMebE3Qfk/s41598-018-23376-5</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1521702000000</published><author><name>S.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>95378d3e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

Reporter virus is a versatile tool to visualize and to analyze virus infections. However, for flaviviruses, it is difficult to maintain the inserted reporter genes on the viral genome, limiting its use in several studies that require homogeneous virus particles and several rounds of virus replication. Here, we showed that flanking inserted GFP genes on both sides with ribosome-skipping 2A sequences improved the stability and the consistency of their fluorescent signals for dengue-virus-serotype 2 (DENV2) reporter viruses. The reporter viruses can infect known susceptible mammalian cell lines and primary CD14+ human monocytes. This design can accommodate several fluorescent protein genes, enabling the generation of multi-color DENV2-16681 reporter viruses with comparable replication capabilities, as demonstrated by their abilities to maintain their fluorescent intensities during co-infections and to exclude superinfections regardless of the fluorescent tags. The reported design of multi-color DENV2 should be useful for high-throughput analyses, single-cell analysis, and characterizations of interference and superinfection in animal models.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>150c3bc8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amporn Suphatrakul, Thaneeya Duangchinda, Natapong Jupatanakul, Kanjanawadee Prasittisa, Suppachoke Onnome, Jutharat Pengon, Bunpote Siridechadilok&lt;/p&gt;

Despite the increasingly recognized importance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a regulator of tumor progression, only few &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; models have been developed to systematically study the effects of TME on tumor behavior in a controlled manner. Here we developed a three-dimensional (3D) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model that recapitulates the physical and compositional characteristics of Glioblastoma (GBM) extracellular matrix (ECM) and incorporates brain stromal cells such as astrocytes and endothelial cell precursors. The model was used to evaluate the effect of TME components on migration and survival of various patient-derived GBM cell lines (GBM10, GBM43 and GBAM1) in the context of STAT3 inhibition. Migration analysis of GBM within the 3D &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrated that the presence of astrocytes significantly increases the migration of GBM, while presence of endothelial precursors has varied effects on the migration of different GBM cell lines. Given the role of the tumor microenvironment as a regulator of STAT3 activity, we tested the effect of the STAT3 inhibitor SH-4-54 on GBM migration and survival. SH-4-54 inhibited STAT3 activity and reduced 3D migration and survival of GBM43 but had no effect on GBM10. SH-4-54 treatment drastically reduced the viability of the stem-like line GBAM1 in liquid culture, but its effect lessened in presence of a 3D ECM and stromal cells. Our results highlight the interplay between the ECM and stromal cells in the microenvironment with the cancer cells and indicate that the impact of these relationships may differ for GBM cells of varying genetic and clinical histories.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e450ba59</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by R.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that &lt;i&gt;Tlr4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (&lt;i&gt;Tlr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt;). With one exception, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt; showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>84d51f53</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Moritz Becher, Svenja Hinrichs, Nina Fluschnik, Jan K.

Although the genetic basis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has been known for almost thirty years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms characterizing the disease are not completely understood and an efficacious treatment remains to be developed. In this study we analyzed proteomics data obtained with the SomaLogic technology from blood serum of a cohort of patients and matched healthy subjects. We developed a workflow based on biomarker identification and network-based pathway analysis that allowed us to describe different deregulated pathways. In addition to muscle-related functions, we identified other biological processes such as apoptosis, signaling in the immune system and neurotrophin signaling as significantly modulated in patients compared with controls. Moreover, our network-based analysis identified the involvement of FoxO transcription factors as putative regulators of different pathways. On the whole, this study provided a global view of the molecular processes involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy that are decipherable from serum proteome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f1eb5aac</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Silvia Parolo, Luca Marchetti, Mario Lauria, Karla Misselbeck, Marie-Pier Scott-Boyer, Laura Caberlotto, Corrado Priami&lt;/p&gt;

The immunological profiles of human specific IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) vary by genetic predisposition, living conditions in different geographical locations and patient’s age. The aim of our study was to analyze sIgE and sIgG4 patterns and their age-dependent changes in patients from the Moscow region. For identifying sIgE and sIgG4 profiles the blood samples from 513 patients aged 6 months to 17 years who were showing symptoms of allergic diseases were analyzed using microarrays containing 31 allergens. The highest sIgE prevalence was observed for birch pollen (32%) among pollen allergens, cat dander (24%) among indoor allergens, and egg whites (21%) among food allergens. The most common sIgG4 response was developed toward egg whites (80% of patients). Age-related elevation was identified for patients with increased sIgE to pollen allergens and indoor allergens (cat or dog dander and house dust mites). For each allergen, the proportion of cases with significant levels of sIgG4 appeared to increase with patients’ age. The data on allergen-specific sIgE and sIgG4 prevalence show both general trends and some local special aspects that are indicative for the Moscow region. This information should be useful in terms of epidemiology of allergic diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>51b4d1bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergei Voloshin, Olga Smoldovskaya, Guzel Feyzkhanova, Alla Arefieva, Lyudmila Pavlushkina, Tatiana Filatova, Veronika Butvilovskaya, Marina Filippova, Yuri Lysov, Sergey Shcherbo, Alexander Makarov, Alla Rubina, Alexander Zasedatelev&lt;/p&gt;

Ultra-precision face turning of Al6061 mirrors using single point diamond turning (SPDT) was undertaken to investigate the correlation between the surface roughness and reflectance. By reducing the feed rate, the optimal feed rate when the chip formation became unstable was studied. Most importantly, the impact on the roughness and reflectance was examined when the chip formation ceased to be continuous. It was determined that for a feed rate below 3 mm/min, the surface roughness always improved as the feed rate decreased, at the cost of a reduction of the normalized reflectance. The reduction of reflectance was determined to be the result of the lower material removal rates that led to a discontinuous chip formation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3d5da0e0</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by L.

Given the frequency with which MAP kinase signaling is dysregulated in cancer, much effort has been focused on inhibiting RAS signaling for therapeutic benefit. KSR1, a pseudokinase that interacts with RAF, is a potential target; it was originally cloned in screens for suppressors of constitutively active RAS, and its deletion prevents RAS-mediated transformation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this work, we used a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to assess whether KSR1 deletion would influence tumor development in the setting of oncogenic RAS. We found that &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice on this background had a modest but significant improvement in all-cause morbidity compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/-&lt;/sup&gt; cohorts. &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, however, still developed tumors, and precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions were detected within a similar timeframe compared to &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No significant differences in pERK expression or in proliferation were noted. RNA sequencing also did not reveal any unique genetic signature in &lt;i&gt;Ksr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; tumors.

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>3e325446</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliano André Bogoni, Maurício Eduardo Graipel, Nivaldo Peroni&lt;/p&gt;

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>44227742</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ameeta S.

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The study aimed to describe the evolution of the seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients included in two cohorts in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected the information on demographic and clinical characteristics of 4,025 and 3,856 HIV-positive Taiwanese, who were aged 18 years or older at designated hospitals around Taiwan in 2004–2007, when an outbreak of HIV infection was occurring, and 2012–2016, when the outbreak was controlled with the implementation of harm reduction program, respectively. Comparisons of HCV seropositivity were made among different age and risk groups for HIV transmission between these two cohorts.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall HCV seroprevalence of the 2004–2007 cohort and 2012–2016 cohort was 43.4% (1,288/2,974) and 18.6% (707/3,793), respectively (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The HCV seroprevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs), though decreasing, was constantly high across the two cohorts, 96.4% and 94.0% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively, and all age groups. In contrast, the corresponding figures among men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals in the two cohorts were 5.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 3.5% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and 9.4% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 10.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.59), respectively. Among sexually transmitted HIV-positive patients, HCV seropositivity was significantly correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], per 1-year increase, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.05) and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer ≥1:8 (aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.03–2.43) in a multivariate analysis including age, gender, route for HIV transmission, baseline CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA load, the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and an RPR titer ≥1:8. Compared with heterosexuals, the aOR for HCV seropositivity among MSM was 0.47 (95% CI, 0.31–0.72).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;HCV seroprevalence among HIV-positive patients in Taiwan decreased with time, probably related to the inclusion of younger adults and more non-IDUs, and remained high among IDUs.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The study aimed to describe the evolution of the seroprevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients included in two cohorts in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected the information on demographic and clinical characteristics of 4,025 and 3,856 HIV-positive Taiwanese, who were aged 18 years or older at designated hospitals around Taiwan in 2004–2007, when an outbreak of HIV infection was occurring, and 2012–2016, when the outbreak was controlled with the implementation of harm reduction program, respectively. Comparisons of HCV seropositivity were made among different age and risk groups for HIV transmission between these two cohorts.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall HCV seroprevalence of the 2004–2007 cohort and 2012–2016 cohort was 43.4% (1,288/2,974) and 18.6% (707/3,793), respectively (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The HCV seroprevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs), though decreasing, was constantly high across the two cohorts, 96.4% and 94.0% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively, and all age groups. In contrast, the corresponding figures among men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexuals in the two cohorts were 5.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 3.5% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and 9.4% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 10.9% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.59), respectively. Among sexually transmitted HIV-positive patients, HCV seropositivity was significantly correlated with age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], per 1-year increase, 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.05) and a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titer ≥1:8 (aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.03–2.43) in a multivariate analysis including age, gender, route for HIV transmission, baseline CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA load, the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, and an RPR titer ≥1:8.

The present study is aimed at assessing the feasibility of delivering the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine to girls through a school-based program in Hong Kong, as well as to examine the facilitators and barriers associated with their participation. We approached 1,229 eligible girls aged 9 to 14 at eight schools in Hong Kong to join the program and then delivered the bivalent HPV vaccine at 0 and 6 months over the course of one school year. The students and their parents completed separate questionnaires to indicate their decision on whether or not to participate, and to assess their knowledge of cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine. The overall vaccine uptake was 81.4% (1,000/1,229) for the first dose and 80.8% (993/1,229) for the second dose. Parents and students were given separate questionnaires and asked whether or not they would like to participate in the vaccination program. 87.1% (1,010/1,160) of parents and 84.9% (974/1,147) of students indicated that they would join the program. The reasons associated with parents’ decision not to vaccinate their daughters primarily included concerns around side effects and safety. Multivariate regression analysis showed that parents who thought that the vaccine would protect their daughter from getting cervical cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01), and those who reported having a doctor’s recommendation (OR = 4.54, 95% CI = 1.05–19.57, p &amp;lt; .05) were more likely to join the program. In contrast, parents who had never heard of the vaccine (OR = .15, 95% CI = .03–.71, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .02), those who were willing to pay more than HK$2,000 for the vaccine (OR = .39, 95% CI = .19–.81, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05), or had a preference to access it through a private clinic (OR = .44, 95% CI = .26–.75, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01) were significantly less likely to allow their daughter to join the program. Delivery of the HPV vaccine with high uptake rate in a school setting is feasible in Hong Kong. Engaging key stakeholders including school administrators, teachers and community physicians, and providing relevant information on safety and vaccine effectiveness to parents were important to the success of the program.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f40dca57</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Winnie Wing Yan Yuen, Albert Lee, Paul K.

Within the human host, the malaria parasite &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; is exposed to multiple selection pressures. The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria, but the extent to which the parasite responds to—or is selected by—this environment remains unclear. From previous studies, the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant, surface antigens. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rNZ95HC-F9Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6902eefa</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gerry Q.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19–49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) compared to controls.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins.

Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI.

Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins.

The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>54ebcb40</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

Our results link high levels of histones to a specific type of genome instability that is quite frequently observed in cancer and uncovers a new mechanism that might be able to respond to high levels of histones.</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35337</originId><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16266461ae2:5f5b940:34f43e70</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35337</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35337</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1522108800000</published><author><name>douglas.maya@cabimer.es (Douglas Maya Miles)</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522134293218</crawled></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</originId><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><fingerprint>b52ff12d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626517550b:6cde3:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25198?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><published>1522114450699</published><author><name>NA</name></author><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522114450699</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</originId><summary><content>Crystal structures and structural interpretation of complexes of azetidine (and related) ligands coordinated to palladium(II) and platinum(II).</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><published>1522972800000</published><description>Crystal structures and structural interpretation of complexes of azetidine (and related) ligands coordinated to palladium(II) and platinum(II).</description><title>Palladium and platinum 2,4-cis-amino azetidine and related complexes</title><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1629c8e89f0:4bf8b1:923c4a60</id><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</link><fingerprint>e4f0a9d5</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</href></item></alternate><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><visual><contentType>image/png</contentType><width>250</width><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-chemrxiv-7984736271254/10998107/thumb.png</url><height>354</height></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagementRate>0.09</engagementRate><crawled>1523045009904</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194786</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194786</originId><updated>1521838800000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Di Carlo, Maria Lamassa, Marco Franceschini, Francesca Bovis, Lorenzo Cecconi, Sanaz Pournajaf, Stefano Paravati, Annibale Biggeri, Domenico Inzitari, Salvatore Ferro, on behalf of the Italian Study Group on Implementation of Stroke Care &lt;/p&gt;
The outcome of stroke patients is complex and multidimensional. We evaluated the impact of acute-phase variables, including clinical state, complications, resource use and interventions, on 6-month survival after first-ever stroke, taking into account baseline conditions exerting a possible effect on outcome.
As part of a National Research Program, we performed a prospective observational study of acute stroke patients in four Italian Regions. Consecutive patients admitted for a period of 3 months to the emergency rooms of participating hospitals were included.
A total of 1030 patients were enrolled (median age 76.0 years, 52.1% males). At 6 months, 816 (79.2%) were alive, and 164 (15.9%) deceased. Survival status at the 6-month follow-up was missing for 50 (4.9%). Neurological state in the acute phase was significantly worse in patients deceased at 6 months, who showed also higher frequency of acute-phase complications. Cox regression analysis adjusted for demographics, pre-stroke function, baseline diseases and risk factors, indicated as significant predictors of 6-month death altered consciousness (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.14–2.53), total anterior circulation infarct (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.44–3.15), hyperthermia (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.18–2.45), pneumonia (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.18–2.61), heart failure (HR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.34–6.13) and nasogastric feeding (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.53–3.60), while antiplatelet therapy during acute phase (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39–0.79), and early mobilisation (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36–0.84) significantly increased 6-month survival.
In a prospective observational study, stroke severity and some acute-phase complications, potentially modifiable, significantly increased the risk of 6-month death, independently of baseline variables.

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>701d1ef2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski, Hugh S.

Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</description><title>Estimating large carnivore populations at global scale based on spatial predictions of density and distribution – Application to the jaguar (&amp;lt;i&gt;Panthera onca&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f4:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194719</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194719</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522098000000</published><author><name>Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>27</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522086304280</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01804</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01804/20180410/images/medium/jm-2017-018043_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01804&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d2096ec8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ranjit Chauhan, David Datzkiw, Shailly Varma Shrivastav, Anuraag Shrivastav&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1d85d779</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Betânia M.

The F test is the standard equal- variance test in Statistics. For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases vs. controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA is another mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified differentially variable (DV) microRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV microRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of microRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variance in cases and variance in controls and about the independence among cases and controls. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first clustering algorithm that aims to detect DV genomic probes. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperformed the probe-wise F test and had certain robustness to the violation of the normality assumption.

For high-throughput genomic data, the probe-wise F test has been successfully used to detect biologically relevant DNA methylation marks that have different variances between two groups of subjects (e.g., cases vs. controls). In addition to DNA methylation, microRNA is another mechanism of epigenetics. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have identified differentially variable (DV) microRNAs. In this article, we proposed a novel model-based clustering to improve the power of the probe-wise F test to detect DV microRNAs. We imposed special structures on covariance matrices for each cluster of microRNAs based on the prior information about the relationship between variance in cases and variance in controls and about the independence among cases and controls. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first clustering algorithm that aims to detect DV genomic probes. Simulation studies showed that the proposed method outperformed the probe-wise F test and had certain robustness to the violation of the normality assumption. Based on two real datasets about human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified 7 DV-only microRNAs (hsa-miR-1826, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-194-star, hsa-miR-222, hsa-miR-502-3p, hsa-miR-93, and hsa-miR-99b) using the proposed method, one (hsa-miR-1826) of which has not yet been reported to relate to HCC in the literature.</description><title>Detecting Differential Variable microRNAs via Model-Based Clustering [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162a5ffcb80:f398ab:923c4a60</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296947v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296947v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1523170800000</published><author><name>Li, X.</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523203427200</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23581-2</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23581-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23581-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XmI_cKtNa1E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5a8ab62</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23581-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23581-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XmI_cKtNa1E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><title>Author Correction: Limited evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores</title><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16294af12fc:a2b62ae:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23581-2</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/XmI_cKtNa1E/s41598-018-23581-2</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><published>1522911600000</published><author><name>Ann Eklund</name></author><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23581-2</href></item></canonical><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522912924412</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/272476</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/272476v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Recent technological advances enable genomics of individual cells, the building blocks of all living organisms.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt; among game animals in Poland. The bio-serotypes and the pathogenicity markers of the analyzed isolates were determined. The experimental material comprised rectal swabs from 857 free-living animals hunter-harvested over a period of 2 years (2013–2014) in hunting districts across Poland. The isolates from bacteriological studies were confirmed by PCR and bio-serotyped based on the results of biochemical and agglutination tests. In the group of the 218 analyzed isolates of &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterocolitica&lt;/i&gt;, 133 were derived from wild boars, 70 from red deer, 11 from roe deer and 4 from fallow deer, and they accounted for 61.0%, 32.1%, 5.1% and 1.8% of all isolates, respectively. Bio-serotyping assays revealed that 91.7% of the examined isolates belonged to biotype 1A (200/218). The remaining 18 isolates belonged to bio-serotypes 1B/NI (3/218, 1.4%), 1B/O:8 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/NI (6/218, 2.8%), 2/O:27 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%), 2/O:9 (2/218, 0.9%), 3/NI (2/218, 0.9%), 4/O:3 (1/218, 0.5%) and 4/O:9 (1/218, 0.5%).

Although methods to detect rhythmicity in genome-scale data are well established, methods to detect changes in rhythmicity or in average expression between experimental conditions are often ad hoc. Here we present LimoRhyde (linear models for rhythmicity, design), a flexible approach for analyzing transcriptome data from circadian systems. Borrowing from cosinor regression, LimoRhyde decomposes circadian or zeitgeber time into multiple components, in order to fit a linear model to the expression of each gene. The linear model can accommodate any number of additional experimental variables, whether discrete or continuous, making it straightforward to detect differential rhythmicity and differential expression using state-of-the-art methods for analyzing microarray and RNA-seq data. In this approach, differential rhythmicity corresponds to a statistical interaction between an experimental variable and circadian time, whereas differential expression corresponds to the main effect of an experimental variable while accounting for circadian time. To demonstrate LimoRhyde&apos;s versatility, we applied it to murine and human circadian transcriptome datasets acquired under various experimental designs. Our results show how LimoRhyde systematizes the analysis of such data, and suggest that LimoRhyde could become a valuable approach for assessing how circadian systems respond to genetic and environmental perturbations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>4ee58738</fingerprint><description>As experiments to interrogate circadian rhythms increase in scale and complexity, methods to analyze the resulting data must keep pace.

Antimicrobial peptides represent an alternative to traditional antibiotics that may be less susceptible to bacterial resistance mechanisms by directly attacking the bacterial cell membrane. However, bacteria have a variety of defense mechanisms that can prevent cationic antimicrobial peptides from reaching the cell membrane. The L- and D-enantiomers of the antimicrobial peptide GL13K were tested against the Gram-positive bacteria &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus gordonii&lt;/i&gt; to understand the role of bacterial proteases and cell wall modifications in bacterial resistance. GL13K was derived from the human salivary protein BPIFA2. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by broth dilution and a serial assay used to determine bacterial resistance. Peptide degradation was determined in a bioassay utilizing a luminescent strain of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; to detect peptide activity. Autolysis and D-alanylation-deficient strains of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gordonii&lt;/i&gt; were tested in autolysis assays and peptide activity assays. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecalis&lt;/i&gt; protease inactivated L-GL13K but not D-GL13K, whereas autolysis did not affect peptide activity. Indeed, the D-enantiomer appeared to kill the bacteria prior to initiation of autolysis. D-alanylation mutants were killed by L-GL13K whereas this modification did not affect killing by D-GL13K. The mutants regained resistance to L-GL13K whereas bacteria did not gain resistance to D-GL13K after repeated treatment with the peptides. D-alanylation affected the hydrophobicity of bacterial cells but hydrophobicity alone did not affect GL13K activity.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic cytokine of the IL-1 family with multiple context dependent functions. We and others have shown that HIV infection is accompanied by increased circulating levels of IL-18 along with decreased levels of its antagonist, Interleukin-18 Binding Protein (IL-18BP). The infection is also accompanied by intestinal inflammation and decreased intestinal integrity as measured by intestinal permeability, regeneration and repair. However, little is known concerning the relation between high level of IL-18 associated with the viral infection and intestinal permeability. Here we demonstrate that HIV treatment increases production of IL-18 and decreases that of IL-18BP production in human intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) lines. IL-18 causes apoptosis of the IEC by activating caspase-1 and caspase-3. It induces epithelial barrier hyperpermeability by decreasing and disrupting both tight and adherens junction proteins, occludin, claudin 2 and beta-catenin. Disorganization of F-actin was also observed in the IEC that were exposed to the cytokine. Moreover IL-18 decreases transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Caco-2 and increases permeability in HT29 monolayers. The cells’ treatment with IL-18 causes an increase in the expression of phosphorylated myosin II regulatory light-chain (p-MLC) and myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK), and a decrease in phosphorylated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (p-STAT)-5.

As a consequence, we propose the hallmark signatures as a ground truth to characterise tails of infrequent genomic alterations and identify potential novel cancer driver genes and networks.</description><title>Dissecting the genomic heterogeneity of cancer hallmarks&apos; acquisition with SLAPenrich [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162301e251a:14df2d3:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/077701v4?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/077701v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1521183600000</published><author><name>Iorio, F.</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521225704730</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1373.10.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><title>Silicon clears a wet path to phosphines</title><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>66138e81</fingerprint><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</originId><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150431:9f3b30f2</id><published>1521740379000</published><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1373-j?rss=1</link><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521742399447</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3196</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>News Features, Front Matter</item></keywords><content><content>Experiments on mice living in more natural habitats can deliver results dramatically different from those in traditional laboratories—with profound implications for biomedical science.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Qualitative studies indicated that cancer survivors may be worried about finding a partner in the future, but whether this concern is warranted is unknown.

Respondents rated their interest in dating this fictive person, this person’s traits, and indicated their preferences about the timing of disclosure. ANOVAs with main and interaction effects of condition, gender, and relationship history were conducted, partial eta squared and Cohen’s &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; were used to estimate the magnitude of effects. Correlations were used to investigate relationships between interest in a date and assessment of traits.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors’ traits were assessed more positively, but interest to date them did not differ from healthy vignettes for both men and women. However, widowed respondents were much less interested in a date with a cancer survivor, and women showed less interest in a cancer survivor during active follow-up relative to survivors beyond follow-up. Most respondents wanted to hear about the cancer diagnosis after a few dates, hardly anyone wanted to hear about this before the first date (2% - 5%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion and implications for cancer survivors &lt;p&gt;Cancer survivors do not have to expect any more problems in finding a date than people without a cancer history, and can wait a few dates before disclosing.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4, and 8 reportedly contribute to progression of metabolic disease, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circulating ANGPTL levels are associated with CVD risk after adjustment for potential confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a single center, cross-sectional study of 988 Japanese subjects undergoing routine health checks. Serum ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using multiple regression analysis we evaluated potential association of circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels with general medical status including age, sex, smoking, drinking, obesity, hypertension, impaired glycometabolism, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hepatic impairment, chronic kidney disease, anemia, cardiac abnormality, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3 levels were relatively high in health-related categories of hepatic impairment and inflammation.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTLs) 3, 4, and 8 reportedly contribute to progression of metabolic disease, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether circulating ANGPTL levels are associated with CVD risk after adjustment for potential confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a single center, cross-sectional study of 988 Japanese subjects undergoing routine health checks. Serum ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using multiple regression analysis we evaluated potential association of circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels with general medical status including age, sex, smoking, drinking, obesity, hypertension, impaired glycometabolism, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, hepatic impairment, chronic kidney disease, anemia, cardiac abnormality, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3 levels were relatively high in health-related categories of hepatic impairment and inflammation. Circulating ANGPTL4 levels were also significantly high in impaired glycometabolism or hepatic impairment but decreased in inflammation. Finally, increased ANGPTL8 levels were observed in obesity, impaired glycometabolism and dyslipidemia. Particularly, increased levels of circulating ANGPTL8 were positively correlated with circulating triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels and inversely correlated with circulating HDL-cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Circulating ANGPTL3, 4, and 8 levels reflect some risk factors for CVD development.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Association of circulating ANGPTL 3, 4, and 8 levels with medical status in a population undergoing routine medical checkups: A cross-sectional study</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9ef:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193731</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193731</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521061200000</published><author><name>Jun Morinaga</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521049501222</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3481</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3481.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Much of gene regulation is carried out by proteins that bind DNA or RNA molecules at specific sequences.

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8544f1bc</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nico A.

Various limitations hinder the timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients. The present study aims to investigate the potential of metabolomics and cytokine profiling for improving the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. Serum and plasma samples were collected from pediatric patients for metabolic and inflammatory mediator analyses respectively. Targeted metabolic profiling was performed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Flow Injection Analysis Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry and targeted cytokine/chemokine profiling was completed using a multiplex platform to compare children with and without appendicitis. Twenty-three children with appendicitis and 35 control children without appendicitis from the Alberta Sepsis Network pediatric cohorts were included. Metabolomic profiling revealed clear separation between the two groups with very good sensitivity (80%), specificity (97%), and AUROC (0.93 ± 0.05) values. Inflammatory mediator analysis also distinguished the two groups with high sensitivity (82%), specificity (100%), and AUROC (0.97 ± 0.02) values. A biopattern comprised of 9 metabolites and 7 inflammatory compounds was detected to be significant for the separation between appendicitis and control groups. Integration of these 16 significant compounds resulted in a combined metabolic and cytokine profile that also demonstrated strong separation between the two groups with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity and AUROC value of 0.96 ± 0.03. The study demonstrated that metabolomics and cytokine mediator profiling is capable of distinguishing children with appendicitis from those without. These results suggest a potential new approach for improving the identification of appendicitis in children.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>b4a9748e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nusrat S.

Diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt; were fed high-protein, phosphorus-rich diets (56–60% protein; ca 18g phosphorus kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; diet) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding until parr-smolt transformation. Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0–2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e03b8fb2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Peruzzi, Velmurugu Puvanendran, Guido Riesen, Rudi Ripman Seim, Ørjan Hagen, Silvia Martínez-Llorens, Inger-Britt Falk-Petersen, Jorge M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Inability to maintain a stable and beneficial microbiota is associated with chronic gut inflammation, which classically manifests as colitis but may more commonly exist as low-grade inflammation that promotes metabolic syndrome. Alterations in microbiota, and associated inflammation, can originate from dysfunction in host proteins that manage the microbiota, such as the flagellin receptor TLR5. That the complete absence of a microbiota (i.e. germfree conditions) eliminates all evidence of inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice demonstrates that this model of gut inflammation is microbiota-dependent. We hypothesize that such microbiota dependency reflects an inability to manage pathobionts, such as Adherent-Invasive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (AIEC). Herein, we examined the extent to which microbiota mismanagement and associated inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice would manifest in a limited and pathobiont-free microbiota. For this purpose, WT and TLR5-deficient mice were generated and maintained with the 8-member consortium of bacteria referred to as “Altered Schaedler Flora” (ASF). Such ASF animals were subsequently inoculated with AIEC reference strain LF82. Feces were assayed for bacterial loads, fecal lipopolysaccharide and flagellin loads, fecal inflammatory marker lipocalin-2 and microbiota composition.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Relative to similarly maintained WT mice, mice lacking TLR5 (T5KO) did not display low-grade intestinal inflammation nor metabolic syndrome under ASF conditions. Concomitantly, the ASF microbial community was similar between WT and T5KO mice, while inoculation with AIEC strain LF82 resulted in alteration of the ASF community in T5KO mice compared to WT control animals. AIEC LF82 inoculation in ASF T5KO mice resulted in microbiota components having elevated levels of bioactive lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, a modest level of low-grade inflammation and increased adiposity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In a limited-complexity pathobiont-free microbiota, loss of the flagellin receptor TLR5 does not impact microbiota composition nor its ability to promote inflammation. Addition of AIEC to this ecosystem perturbs microbiota composition, increases levels of lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, but only modestly promotes gut inflammation and adiposity, suggesting that the phenotypes previously associated with loss of this innate immune receptor require disruption of complex microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>5b02bcfd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benoit Chassaing, Andrew T.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>e9fb2329</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas R.

While there is substantial evidence that adults who violate gender stereotypes often face backlash (i.e. social and economic penalties), less is known about the nature of gender stereotypes for young children, and the penalties that children may face for violating them. We conducted three experiments, with over 2000 adults from the US, to better understand the content and consequences of adults’ gender stereotypes for young children. In Experiment 1, we tested which characteristics adults (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 635) believed to be descriptive (i.e. typical), prescriptive (i.e. required), and proscriptive (i.e. forbidden) for preschool-aged boys and girls. Using the characteristics that were rated in Experiment 1, we then constructed vignettes that were either ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’, and manipulated whether the vignettes were said to describe a boy or a girl. Experiment 2 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 697) revealed that adults rated stereotype-violating children as less likeable than their stereotype-conforming peers, and that this difference was more robust for boys than girls. Experiment 3 (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 731) was a direct replication of Experiment 2, and revealed converging evidence of backlash against stereotype-violating children. In sum, our results suggest that even young children encounter backlash from adults for stereotype violations, and that these effects may be strongest for boys.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>40cae228</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Sullivan, Corinne Moss-Racusin, Michael Lopez, Katherine Williams&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f1ad52a1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;

Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Most women living with HIV can deliver vaginally—National data from Finland 1993–2013</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123922:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1521752400000</published><author><name>Inka Aho</name></author><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1521740721801</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1533.full</canonicalUrl><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Cell Biology</item></keywords><content><content>&lt;p&gt;The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved translational and transcriptional program affecting metabolism, memory, and immunity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Heavy burden of child injuries and lack of policy response in Ethiopia call for an improved understanding of the situation and development of action plans from multiple governmental agencies and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A consortium of international and Ethiopian researchers and stakeholders used extensive literature review and mixed analytical methods to estimate and project the burden of fatal and non-fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia from 2015 to 2030. Estimates were derived for children aged 0–14 years. Data sources include a longitudinal study conducted by the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia and the World Bank as well as model-based estimates from World Health Organization 2017 and Global Burden of Disease 2016 project.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Injuries caused about 25 thousand deaths among 0-14-year olds in Ethiopia in 2015. The leading cause of fatal child unintentional injuries in Ethiopia was road-traffic injuries, followed by fire, heat and hot substances and drowning. The death rate due to injuries among 0–14 years olds was about 50 percent higher in males than females. Rural children were exposed to a greater risk of injury than their urban peers. The longitudinal survey suggests that the incidence rate of child injuries increased during the period 2011–2014. The annual mortality caused by injuries is projected to increase from 10,697 in 2015 to 11,279 in 2020 and 11,989 in 2030 among children under 5 years, an increase of 12 percentage points in 15 years. The number of deaths among 0-14-year olds will be 26,463, 27,807, and 30,364 respectively in 2015, 2020, and 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;As the first multisectoral collaboration on child injuries in Ethiopia, this study identified gaps in understanding of the burden of child injuries in Ethiopia. In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>6d69379</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qingfeng Li, Olakunle Alonge, Collene Lawhorn, Yirga Ambaw, Smita Kumar, Troy Jacobs, Adnan A.

In consultation with Ethiopian government and other stakeholders, we propose starting an injury surveillance system at health clinics and hospitals and building an intervention package based on existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><title>Child injuries in Ethiopia: A review of the current situation with projections</title><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f08:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194692</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1522184400000</published><author><name>Qingfeng Li</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1522172707031</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195667</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195667</originId><updated>1523307600000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha M.

Cancer affects 39.6% of Americans at some point during their lifetime. Solid tumor microenvironments are characterized by a disorganized, leaky vasculature that promotes regions of low oxygenation (hypoxia). Tumor hypoxia is a key predictor of poor treatment outcome for all radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy and surgery procedures, and is a hallmark of metastatic potential. In particular, the radiation therapy dose needed to achieve the same tumor control probability in hypoxic tissue as in normoxic tissue can be up to 3 times higher. Even very small tumors (&amp;lt;2–3 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) comprise 10–30% of hypoxic regions in the form of chronic and/or transient hypoxia fluctuating over the course of seconds to days. We investigate the potential of recently developed lipid-stabilized oxygen microbubbles (OMBs) to improve the therapeutic ratio of RT. OMBs, but not nitrogen microbubbles (NMBs), are shown to significantly increase dissolved oxygen content when added to water in vitro and increase tumor oxygen levels in vivo in a rat fibrosarcoma model. Tumor control is significantly improved with OMB but not NMB intra-tumoral injections immediately prior to RT treatment and effect size is shown to depend on initial tumor volume on RT treatment day, as expected.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>159357f9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha M.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a8213765</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tyler C.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (&amp;lt;8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>8f45462f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Seo Yoon, Cheol Hwan So, Hae Sang Lee, Jung Sub Lim, Jin Soon Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>f78ae144</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Guo, Zhen Yang, Shaotao Zhi, Zhu Feng, Chong Lei, Yong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

VenomKB is accompanied by a suite of tools for programmatic access, and, in this article, we highlight scenarios demonstrating its usefulness and novel contributions to toxinology, pharmacology, and informatics. Availability: VenomKB can be accessed online at http://venomkb.org/, and the code can be found at https://github.com/tatonetti-lab/venomkb/. All code and data are available under open-source and open-access licenses.</description><title>VenomKB v2.0: A knowledge repository for computational toxinology [NEW RESULTS]</title><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1629d160b7c:59db9c:7c9981b6</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295204v1?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295204v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><published>1522998000000</published><author><name>Romano, J.</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><crawled>1523053890428</crawled></item><item><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194063</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194063</originId><updated>1521147600000</updated><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Qiang Lu, Guanghui Liu, Chuanli Xiao, Chuanzhen Hu, Shiwu Zhang, Ronald X.

In this paper we report the development of a cost-effective, modular, open source, and fully automated slide-scanning microscope, composed entirely of easily available off-the-shelf parts, and capable of bright field and fluorescence modes. The automated X-Y stage is composed of two low-cost micrometer stages coupled to stepper motors operated in open-loop mode. The microscope is composed of a low-cost CMOS sensor and low-cost board lenses placed in a 4f configuration. The system has approximately 1 micron resolution, limited by the f/# of available board lenses. The microscope is compact, measuring just 25×25×30 cm, and has an absolute positioning accuracy of ±1 μm in the X and Y directions. A Z-stage enables autofocusing and imaging over large fields of view even on non-planar samples, and custom software enables automatic determination of sample boundaries and image mosaicking. We demonstrate the utility of our device through imaging of fluorescent- and transmission-dye stained blood and fecal smears containing human and animal parasites, as well as several prepared tissue samples. These results demonstrate image quality comparable to high-end commercial microscopes at a cost of less than US$400 for a bright-field system, with an extra US$100 needed for the fluorescence module.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>80970825</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiang Lu, Guanghui Liu, Chuanli Xiao, Chuanzhen Hu, Shiwu Zhang, Ronald X.

Results: We introduce FAVITES, a robust framework for simulating realistic datasets for epidemics that are caused by fast-evolving pathogens like HIV. FAVITES creates a generative model that produces many items relevant to an epidemic, such as contact networks, transmission networks, phylogenetic trees, and error-prone sequence datasets. FAVITES is designed to be flexible and extensible by dividing the generative model into modules, each of which is expressed as a fixed API that can be implemented using various sub-models. We use FAVITES to simulate HIV datasets resembling the San Diego epidemic and show that the simulated datasets are realistic. We then use the simulated data to make inferences about the epidemic and how it is impacted by increased treatment efforts. We also study two transmission network reconstruction methods and their effectiveness in detecting fast-growing clusters. Availability and implementation: FAVITES is available at https://github.com/niemasd/FAVITES, and a Docker image can be found on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/r/niemasd/favites).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>1ca403d9</fingerprint><description>Motivation: The ability to simulate epidemics as a function of model parameters allows for the gain of insights unobtainable from real datasets.
