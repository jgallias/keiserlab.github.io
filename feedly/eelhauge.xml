Background &lt;p&gt;Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are located in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene, are reported to be associated with body weight and the body mass index (BMI). However, their effects on anthropometric measurements in adolescents are poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the association of three adjacent polymorphisms (rs9930506, rs9930501, &amp;amp; rs9932754) in the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene with anthropometric indices in Iranian adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The participants comprised a total of 237 adolescent males who were recruited randomly from two high schools in Tehran, Iran. The DNA samples were genotyped for the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms by DNA sequencing. BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and body muscle percentage (BM%) were determined using a validated bioelectrical impedance analysis scale. The association of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms with weight, height, BMI, BF%, and BM% was investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A haplotype of rs9930506, rs9930501, and rs9932754 (GGT) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; with complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) was found to be significantly associated with higher weight (OR = 1.32), BMI (OR = 5.36) and BF% (OR = 1.46), and lower BM% (OR = 3.59) (all P&amp;lt;0.001). None of the students with GGC genotypes were underweight, while all of the students with AAT genotypes had high muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A haplotype in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene had a strong association with obesity indices in Iranian adolescent males. The &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; gene polymorphisms might have greater effects on anthropometric indices than what was previously imagined.

Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>743ddfcb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Felicia R.

Background &lt;p&gt;HIV prevalence varies from 1.7% to 14.8% between ethnic groups in Uganda. Understanding the factors responsible for this heterogeneity in HIV spread may guide prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the relationship between HIV prevalence by ethnic group and a range of risk factors as well as the prevalence of herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), syphilis and symptomatic STIs in the 2004/2005 Uganda HIV/AIDS Sero-Behavioural Survey—a two stage, nationally representative, population based survey of 15–59-year-olds. Spearman’s correlation was used to assess the relationship between HIV prevalence and each variable.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a positive association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2, symptomatic STIs and high-risk sex (sex with a non-cohabiting, non-marital partner) for women. Non-significant positive associations were present between HIV and high-risk sex for men and lifetime number of partners for men and women.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Variation in sexual behavior may contribute to the variations in HIV, HSV-2 and other STI prevalence by ethnic group in Uganda.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing breastfeeding rates have been associated with reductions in disease in babies and mothers as well as in related costs. ‘Nourishing Start for Health (NoSH)’, a financial incentive scheme has been proposed as a potentially effective way to increase both the number of mothers breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;To establish women’s relative preferences for different aspects of a financial incentive scheme for breastfeeding and to identify importance of scheme characteristics on probability on participation in an incentive scheme.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A discrete choice experiment (DCE) obtained information on alternative specifications of the NoSH scheme designed to promote continued breastfeeding duration until at least 6 weeks after birth. Four attributes framed alternative scheme designs: value of the incentive; minimum breastfeeding duration required to receive incentive; method of verifying breastfeeding; type of incentive. Three versions of the DCE questionnaire, each containing 8 different choice sets, provided 24 choice sets for analysis. The questionnaire was mailed to 2,531 women in the South Yorkshire Cohort (SYC) aged 16–45 years in IMD quintiles 3–5. The analytic approach considered conditional and mixed effects logistic models to account for preference heterogeneity that may be associated with a variation in effects mediated by respondents’ characteristics.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;564 women completed the questionnaire and a response rate of 22% was achieved. Most of the included attributes were found to affect utility and therefore the probability to participate in the incentive scheme. Higher rewards were preferred, although the type of incentive significantly affected women’s preferences on average. We found evidence for preference heterogeneity based on individual characteristics that mediated preferences for an incentive scheme.ConclusionsAlthough participants’ opinion in our sample was mixed, financial incentives for breastfeeding may be an acceptable and effective instrument to change behaviour.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, which is not well understood at the molecular level. Exactly why some brain regions produce epileptic discharges and others do not is not known. Patients who fail to respond to antiseizure medication (refractory epilepsy) can benefit from surgical removal of brain regions to reduce seizure frequency. The tissue removed in these surgeries offers an invaluable resource to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of human epilepsy. Here, we report a proteomic study to determine whether there are common proteomic patterns in human brain regions that produce epileptic discharges. We analyzed human brain samples, as part of the Systems Biology of Epilepsy Project (SBEP). These brain pieces are &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologically characterized human brain samples withdrawn from the neocortex of six patients with refractory epilepsy. This study is unique in that for each of these six patients the comparison of protein expression was made within the same patient: a more epileptic region was compared to a less epileptic brain region. The amount of epileptic activity was defined for each patient as the frequency of their interictal spikes (electric activity between seizures that is a parameter strongly linked to epilepsy). Proteins were resolved from three subcellular fractions, using a 2D differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), revealing 31 identified protein spots that changed significantly. Interestingly, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was found to be consistently down regulated in high spiking brain tissue and showed a strong negative correlation with spike frequency. We also developed a two-step analysis method to select for protein species that changed frequently among the patients and identified these proteins. A total of 397 protein spots of interest (SOI) were clustered by protein expression patterns across all samples. These clusters were used as markers and this analysis predicted proteomic changes due to both histological differences and molecular pathways, revealed by examination of gene ontology clusters. Our experimental design and proteomic data analysis predicts novel glial changes, increased angiogenesis, and changes in cytoskeleton and neuronal projections between high and low interictal spiking regions. Quantitative histological staining of these same tissues for both the vascular and glial changes confirmed these findings, which provide new insights into the structural and functional basis of neocortical epilepsy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195639</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6cf59a96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gal Keren-Aviram, Fabien Dachet, Shruti Bagla, Karina Balan, Jeffrey A.

The neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is pathologically characterized by the massive influx of immune cells into the central nervous system. This contributes to demyelination and axonal damage which causes symptoms such as motor and cognitive dysfunctions. The migration of leukocytes from the blood vessel is orchestrated by a multitude of factors whose determination is essential in reducing cellular influx in MS patients and the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model. The here studied enzyme tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is present intracellularly, on the cell surface and extracellularly. There it contributes to cellular adhesion and migration via its transamidation activity and possibly by facilitating cellular interaction with the extracellular matrix. Previous data from our group showed reduced motor symptoms and cellular infiltration after using a pharmacological TG2 transamidation activity inhibitor in a rat EAE model. However, it remained elusive if the cross-linking activity of the enzyme resulted in the observed effects. To follow-up, we now characterized two new small molecule TG2 activity inhibitors, BJJF078 and ERW1041E. Both compounds are potent inhibitor of recombinant human and mouse Transglutaminase enzyme activity, mainly TG2 and the close related enzyme TG1. In addition they did not affect the binding of TG2 to the extracellular matrix substrate fibronectin, a process via which TG2 promotes cellular adhesion and migration. We found, that ERW1041E but not BJJF078 resulted in reduced EAE disease motor-symptoms while neither caused apparent changes in pathology (cellular influx), Transglutaminase activity or expression of inflammation related markers in the spinal cord, compared to vehicle treated controls. Although we cannot exclude issues on bioavailability and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; efficacy of the used compounds, we hypothesize that extracellular TG1/TG2 activity is of greater importance than (intra-)cellular activity in mouse EAE pathology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196433</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>dbc3200e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Navina L.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ccf2ae76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matteo Colombo, Georgi Duev, Michèle B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Concerns regarding vaccine safety are increasing along with lack of compliance to vaccination schedules. This study aimed to assess vaccination-related risks and the impact of a Special Immunization Service (SIS) at the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Padua on vaccination compliance among participants.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective cohort study included all children attending the SIS from January 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2002 to December 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; 2015. The Service is divided into a clinic (SIS-C) where all referred children undergo a pre-vaccination visit and an area within the Pediatric Emergency Department (SIS-PED) where children are vaccinated if indicated. During each SIS-C visit, age, gender, admission criteria and scheduled vaccinations were recorded, with any vaccine-related adverse events captured during SIS-PED visits. Follow-up was conducted to evaluate vaccination plan completion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;359 children received 560 vaccine administrations (41.3% MMR/MMRV, 17.5% hexavalent) at the SIS during the 14 year study. Admission criteria were adverse events after previous vaccination (immediate, IgE/not IgE mediated, and late) in 27.2% of cases, non-anaphylactic allergies (mostly egg allergy) in 42.7% and anaphylaxis in 10.3%. After vaccination, 15/560 (2.7%) mild adverse events were observed. 96.3% of children vaccinated at least once at the SIS-PED and available for follow-up completed their vaccination plan, in contrast to 55.5% of children referred to the SIS-C who were not vaccinated in SIS-PED.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For children referred to SIS-C and available for follow-up, vaccination in SIS-PED was associated with more frequent completion of vaccination plans, indicating a benefit of the service to vaccine coverage.

In face-to-face social interactions, blind and visually impaired persons (VIPs) lack access to nonverbal cues like facial expressions, body posture, and gestures, which may lead to impaired interpersonal communication. In this study, a wearable sensory substitution device (SSD) consisting of a head mounted camera and a haptic belt was evaluated to determine whether vibrotactile cues around the waist could be used to convey facial expressions to users and whether such a device is desired by VIPs for use in daily living situations. Ten VIPs (mean age: 38.8, SD: 14.4) and 10 sighted persons (SPs) (mean age: 44.5, SD: 19.6) participated in the study, in which validated sets of pictures, silent videos, and videos with audio of facial expressions were presented to the participant. A control measurement was first performed to determine how accurately participants could identify facial expressions while relying on their functional senses. After a short training, participants were asked to determine facial expressions while wearing the emotion feedback system. VIPs using the device showed significant improvements in their ability to determine which facial expressions were shown. A significant increase in accuracy of 44.4% was found across all types of stimuli when comparing the scores of the control (mean±SEM: 35.0±2.5%) and supported (mean±SEM: 79.4±2.1%) phases. The greatest improvements achieved with the support of the SSD were found for silent stimuli (68.3% for pictures and 50.8% for silent videos). SPs also showed consistent, though not statistically significant, improvements while supported. Overall, our study shows that vibrotactile cues are well suited to convey facial expressions to VIPs in real-time. Participants became skilled with the device after a short training session. Further testing and development of the SSD is required to improve its accuracy and aesthetics for potential daily use.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194737</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c0ef7590</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hendrik P.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis (SDS) is a protein separation technique widely used, for example, prior to immunoblotting. Samples are usually prepared in a buffer containing both high concentrations of reducers and high concentrations of SDS. This conjunction renders the samples incompatible with common protein assays. By chelating the SDS, cyclodextrins make the use of simple, dye-based colorimetric assays possible. In this paper, we describe the optimization of the assay, focussing on the cyclodextrin/SDS ratio and the use of commercial assay reagents. The adaptation of the assay to a microplate format and using other detergent-containing conventional extraction buffers is also described.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195755</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>60f68c6d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thierry Rabilloud&lt;/p&gt;

Freshwater reservoir offsets (FROs) occur when AMS dates on charred, encrusted food residues on pottery predate a pot’s chronological context because of the presence of ancient carbon from aquatic resources such as fish. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated that FROs vary widely within and between water bodies and between fish in those water bodies. Lipid analyses have identified aquatic biomarkers that can be extracted from cooking residues as potential evidence for FROs. However, lacking has been efforts to determine empirically how much fish with FROs needs to be cooked in a pot with other resources to result in significant FRO on encrusted cooking residue and what percentage of fish C in a residue is needed to result in the recovery of aquatic biomarkers. Here we provide preliminary assessments of both issues. Our results indicate that in historically-contingent, high alkalinity environments &amp;lt;20% C from fish may result in a statistically significant FRO, but that biomarkers for aquatic resources may be present in the absence of a significant FRO.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196407</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>caa5cb94</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by John P.

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b761e70b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control. This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bc1ca964</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergio Fabris, David A.

Mounting evidence suggests that glycans, rather than merely serving as a “shield”, contribute critically to antigenicity of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein, representing critical antigenic determinants for many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). While many studies have focused on defining the role of individual glycans or groups of proximal glycans in bNAb binding, little is known about the effects of changes in the overall glycan landscape in modulating antibody access and Env antigenicity. Here we developed a systems glycobiology approach to reverse engineer the complexity of HIV glycan heterogeneity to guide antigenicity-based &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; glycoprotein design. bNAb binding was assessed against a panel of 94 recombinant gp120 monomers exhibiting defined glycan site occupancies. Using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm, bNAb-specific glycan footprints were identified and used to design antigens that selectively alter bNAb antigenicity as a proof-of concept. Our approach provides a new design strategy to predictively modulate antigenicity via the alteration of glycan topography, thereby focusing the humoral immune response on sites of viral vulnerability for HIV.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XbpST9Ne8uU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Han Yu, Peng Zhao, Monia Draghi, Claudia Arevalo, Christina B.

Our objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections in adults and children in secondary care settings, using the evidence from published systematic reviews. We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl. Our primary outcome was clinical resolution. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE criteria. We included 6 systematic reviews (n = 3,162). Four reviews were rated high quality, and two of moderate quality. In adults, there was no difference between shorter versus longer duration in clinical resolution rates for peritonitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), or acute pyelonephritis and septic UTI (clinical failure: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.18). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. In children, there was no difference in clinical resolution rates for pneumonia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 48%), pyelonephritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) and confirmed bacterial meningitis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. In conclusion, there is currently a limited body of evidence to clearly assess the clinical benefits of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics in secondary care.

Our objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections in adults and children in secondary care settings, using the evidence from published systematic reviews. We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl. Our primary outcome was clinical resolution. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE criteria. We included 6 systematic reviews (n = 3,162). Four reviews were rated high quality, and two of moderate quality. In adults, there was no difference between shorter versus longer duration in clinical resolution rates for peritonitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), or acute pyelonephritis and septic UTI (clinical failure: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.18). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. In children, there was no difference in clinical resolution rates for pneumonia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 48%), pyelonephritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) and confirmed bacterial meningitis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. In conclusion, there is currently a limited body of evidence to clearly assess the clinical benefits of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics in secondary care. High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194858</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Igho J.

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F.

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>386aa806</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

Our results do not support the view that readers routinely pre-activate the phonological form of predictable words.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02123</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02123/20180327/images/medium/jp-2018-02123f_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02123&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA.

Numerous factors affect how people choose a fine dining restaurant, including food quality, service quality, food safety, and hedonic value. A conceptual framework for evaluating restaurant selection behavior has not yet been developed. This study surveyed 150 individuals with fine dining experience and proposed the use of mental accounting and axiomatic design to construct a consumer economic behavior model. Linear and logistic regressions were employed to determine model correlations and the probability of each factor affecting behavior. The most crucial factor was food quality, followed by service and dining motivation, particularly regarding family dining. Safe ingredients, high cooking standards, and menu innovation all increased the likelihood of consumers choosing fine dining restaurants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194886</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>773d0fd3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Cheng-Fu Hsiao, Sang-Bing Tsai&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. Sera were fractionated, randomly applied to protein chip arrays (IMAC, CM10 and H50) and spectra were generated at low and high laser intensities.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sixteen biomarkers achieved a p value &amp;lt; 0.01 (ROC values &gt; 0.75 or &amp;lt; 0.25) predictive of fibrosis status in co-infected individuals and 14 in mono infected subjects. Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects. Candidate diagnostic algorithms were created to distinguish between non-fibrotic and fibrotic individuals using a panel of 4 biomarker peaks.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data suggest that SELDI MS profiling can identify diagnostic serum biomarkers for fibrosis that are both common and distinct in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195148</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>441554e2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Makan Golizeh, Carlos E.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194860</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5750fff5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between stone composition and single-energy noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) parameters, including stone heterogeneity index (SHI) and mean stone density (MSD), in patients with urinary calculi. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 255 patients who underwent operations or procedures for urinary stones or had spontaneous stone passage between December 2014 and October 2015. Among these, 214 patients with urinary calculi who underwent NCCT and stone composition analyses were included in the study. Maximal stone length (MSL), mean stone density (MSD), and stone heterogeneity index (SHI) were determined on pretreatment NCCT. The mean MSD (454.68±177.80 HU) and SHI (115.82±96.31 HU) of uric acid stones were lower than those of all other types. Based on post hoc tests, MSD was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001). SHI was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001) Receiver operating characteristic curves of uric acid stones for MSD and SHI demonstrated that SHI (cut-off value: 140.4 HU) was superior to MSD (cut-off value: 572.3 HU) in predicting uric acid stones (P&amp;lt;0.001).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a9b18625</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Soo Lee, Kang Su Cho, Seung Hwan Lee, Young Eun Yoon, Dong Hyuk Kang, Won Sik Jeong, Hae Do Jung, Jong Kyou Kwon, Joo Yong Lee&lt;/p&gt;

SHI was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001) Receiver operating characteristic curves of uric acid stones for MSD and SHI demonstrated that SHI (cut-off value: 140.4 HU) was superior to MSD (cut-off value: 572.3 HU) in predicting uric acid stones (P&amp;lt;0.001).</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193945</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jong Soo Lee</name></author><title>Stone heterogeneity index on single-energy noncontrast computed tomography can be a positive predictor of urinary stone composition</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7124:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193945</link><published>1523566800000</published></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_Paramedic_Treatment_for_Modeling_Explicitly_Solvated_Chemical_Reaction_Mechanisms/6045422</originId><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><crawled>1522247160221</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><fingerprint>18130223</fingerprint><description>We report a static quantum chemistry modeling treatment to study how solvent molecules affect chemical

Background &lt;p&gt;Risk prediction is crucial in many areas of medical practice, such as cardiac transplantation, but existing clinical risk-scoring methods have suboptimal performance. We develop a novel risk prediction algorithm and test its performance on the database of all patients who were registered for cardiac transplantation in the United States during 1985-2015.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We develop a new, interpretable, methodology (ToPs: Trees of Predictors) built on the principle that specific predictive (survival) models should be used for specific clusters within the patient population. ToPs &lt;i&gt;discovers&lt;/i&gt; these specific clusters and the specific predictive model that performs best for each cluster. In comparison with existing clinical risk scoring methods and state-of-the-art machine learning methods, our method provides significant improvements in survival predictions, both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. For instance: in terms of 3-month survival post-transplantation, our method achieves AUC of 0.660; the best clinical risk scoring method (RSS) achieves 0.587. In terms of 3-year survival/mortality predictions post-transplantation (in comparison to RSS), holding specificity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts survival for 2,442 (14.0%) more patients (of 17,441 who actually survived); holding sensitivity at 80.0%, our algorithm correctly predicts mortality for 694 (13.0%) more patients (of 5,339 who did not survive). ToPs achieves similar improvements for other time horizons and for predictions pre-transplantation. ToPs discovers the most relevant features (covariates), uses available features to best advantage, and can adapt to changes in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We show that, in comparison with existing clinical risk-scoring methods and other machine learning methods, ToPs significantly improves survival predictions both post- and pre-cardiac transplantation. ToPs provides a more accurate, personalized approach to survival prediction that can benefit patients, clinicians, and policymakers in making clinical decisions and setting clinical policy. Because survival prediction is widely used in clinical decision-making across diseases and clinical specialties, the implications of our methods are far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194985</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ed2de656</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinsung Yoon, William R.

There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighing (IPTW) using two sets of propensity scores (PSs) was used to estimate marginal incidence odds ratios (ORs) for MS contrasting pre-specified substance use. The estimated marginal OR was 6.03 (95% confidence interval: 3.54;10.3, using trimmed weights at the 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of the stabilized weight distribution) in both IPTW analyses comparing lifetime substance use (opioids, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and stimulants) for at least one time monthly during a six-months or longer period vs. no such history of drug use. Subject to limitation of causal claims based on case-control studies, this study suggests that monthly drug or substance use for a period of at least six consecutive months, may increase the risk of MS by factor 3.5 or higher.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196244</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>53773d93</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ibrahim Abdollahpour, Saharnaz Nedjat, Mohammad Ali Mansournia, Tibor Schuster&lt;/p&gt;

The Salmon louse (&lt;i&gt;Lepeophtheirus salmonis&lt;/i&gt;) is a marine ectoparasite of salmonid fish in the Northern Hemisphere and considered as a major challenge in aquaculture and a threat to wild populations of salmonids. Adult female lice produce a large number of lipid-rich eggs, however, the mechanism of maternal lipid transport into developing eggs during salmon louse reproduction has not been described. In the present study, a full-length &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt; lipophorin receptor (&lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt;) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; in reproduction and lipid metabolism in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonis&lt;/i&gt;. In larvae, the transcription of &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; was decreased by 44–54% while in an experiment &lt;i&gt;LsLpR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195783</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f5ffbd1c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Tanveer Khan, Sussie Dalvin, Qaiser Waheed, Frank Nilsen, Rune Male&lt;/p&gt;

The flagellum Bourgoin’s organ is a complex sensory unit with 2–3 internal sensilla coeloconica. During nymphal stages, the sensory surface available for a chemoreceptive function particularly increases with the number and size of sensilla placodea on the antennal pedicel. From first to fourth instar and to adult males and females, plate organ sensory surface is estimated to increase respectively by 33x, 68x and 125x (= 2.72 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.02 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively for males and females). The most important increase (5x) occurs between second and third instar. In parallel, a distinctive pair of plate organs on the flagellum decreases in size from first to third instar, and disappears.

Diversity, disparity and evolution of nymphal sensilla, and their sexual dimorphism in adults are discussed in the context of the species and planthopper behaviour.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194995</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Rong-Rong Wang</name></author><title>Relating antennal sensilla diversity and possible species behaviour in the planthopper pest &amp;lt;i&gt;Lycorma delicatula&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Fulgoridae)</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1e:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194995</link><published>1522184400000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5030801?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b404d80a</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5030801?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Boy Lankhaar</name></author><title>Erratum: “Hyperfine interactions and internal rotation in methanol” [J.

Humans have a remarkable ability to simulate the minds of others. How the brain distinguishes between mental states attributed to self and mental states attributed to someone else is unknown. Here, we investigated how fundamental neural learning signals are selectively attributed to different agents. Specifically, we asked whether learning signals are encoded in agent-specific neural patterns or whether a self–other distinction depends on encoding agent identity separately from this learning signal. To examine this, we tasked subjects to learn continuously 2 models of the same environment, such that one was selectively attributed to self and the other was selectively attributed to another agent. Combining computational modelling with magnetoencephalography (MEG) enabled us to track neural representations of prediction errors (PEs) and beliefs attributed to self, and of simulated PEs and beliefs attributed to another agent. We found that the representational pattern of a PE reliably predicts the identity of the agent to whom the signal is attributed, consistent with a neural self–other distinction implemented via agent-specific learning signals. Strikingly, subjects exhibiting a weaker neural self–other distinction also had a reduced behavioural capacity for self–other distinction and displayed more marked subclinical psychopathological traits. The neural self–other distinction was also modulated by social context, evidenced in a significantly reduced decoding of agent identity in a nonsocial control task. Thus, we show that self–other distinction is realised through an encoding of agent identity intrinsic to fundamental learning signals. The observation that the fidelity of this encoding predicts psychopathological traits is of interest as a potential neurocomputational psychiatric biomarker.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/l0SSGSKOA4E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sam Ereira, Raymond J.

DepR, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator encoded by the last gene of the putative &lt;i&gt;min&lt;/i&gt; operon (&lt;i&gt;orf21-20-19-depR&lt;/i&gt;) located at the downstream region of the anticancer agent FK228 biosynthetic gene cluster in &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; No. 968, positively regulates the biosynthesis of FK228. In this work, the mechanism underlining this positive regulation was probed by multiple approaches. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting assay (DIFA) identified a conserved 35-nt DNA segment in the &lt;i&gt;orf21-orf22&lt;/i&gt; intergenic region where the purified recombinant DepR binds to. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) promoter probe assays established that transcription of phasin gene &lt;i&gt;orf22&lt;/i&gt; increases in the &lt;i&gt;depR&lt;/i&gt; deletion mutant of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;violaceum&lt;/i&gt; (CvΔdepR) compared to the wild-type strain. FK228 production in the &lt;i&gt;orf22&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressed strain &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;violaceum&lt;/i&gt; was reduced compared with the wild-type strain. DepR has two conserved cysteine residues C199 and C208 presumed to form a disulfide bridge upon sensing oxidative stress. C199X point mutations that locked DepR in a reduced conformation decreased the DNA-binding affinity of DepR; T232A or R278A mutation also had a negative impact on DNA binding of DepR. Complementation of CvΔdepR with any of those versions of &lt;i&gt;depR&lt;/i&gt; carrying a single codon mutation was not able to restore FK228 production to the level of wild-type strain. All evidences collectively suggested that DepR positively regulates the biosynthesis of FK228 through indirect metabolic networking.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196173</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4c0dfe</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yongjian Qiao, Tiantian Tong, Jiao Xue, Wenjing Lin, Zixin Deng, Yi-Qiang Cheng, Dongqing Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; is an important cause of infection and commonly colonizes the nasopharynx of young children, along with other potentially pathogenic bacteria. The objectives of this study were to estimate the carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moraxella catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; in young children in Indonesia, and to examine interactions between these bacterial species. 302 healthy children aged 12–24 months were enrolled in community health centers in the Bandung, Central Lombok, and Padang regions. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and stored according to World Health Organization recommendations, and bacterial species detected by qPCR. Pneumococcal serotyping was conducted by microarray and latex agglutination/Quellung. Overall carriage prevalence was 49.5% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, 27.5% for &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, 42.7% for &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catarrhalis&lt;/i&gt;, and 7.3% for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt;.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0–14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0–38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1–5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194138</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>abf3927</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Nguenha, Almiro Tivane, Mirela Pale, Loira Machalele, Afonso Nacoto, Germano Pires, Edirsse Mationane, Judite Salência, Félix Gundane, Délcio Muteto, Josina Chilundo, Sandra Mavale, Noorbebi Adamo, Cynthia Semá-Baltazar, Orvalho Augusto, Eduardo Gudo, Tufária Mussá&lt;/p&gt;

A coproduction tests of quaternary (Q) phase(6CaO·4Al2O3·MgO·SiO2) -3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cement clinker and an experimental study on the relationship between the mineral production capability and the physiochemical properties are conducted in a two-stage multiphase reaction test bed with Changguang coal. X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analyses are performed on the coproduction clinker samples. The results demonstrate that, with the reduction in particle sizes of the coal powder and the additives and expanded screening level differences between them, both the proportion of Q phase and the mass of 3CaO·3Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the clinker increase accordingly. When mixed coal powder particles are prepared through reducing particle sizes and expanding screening level differences between coal powder and additives, the additives CaO and MgO are more likely to be enclosed by coal powder to form globular polymerized particles. In addition, this preparation aids in polymerization and promotes even distribution of CaO, MgO and coal minerals, thus facilitating clinker mineral formation reactions of inorganic substances in the mixed coal powder. Target minerals, such as 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase, are found in both industrial high-calcium limestone and low-calcium limestone coproduction clinker samples. A diffraction peak of free CaO is also evident in both samples. Compared with a coproduction clinker sample of high-calcium limestone, that of low-calcium limestone exhibits higher diffraction peaks for 2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q phase.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm.

Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can promote evolutionary adaptation by transforming a species’ relationship to the environment.

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can promote evolutionary adaptation by transforming a species’ relationship to the environment. In most well-understood cases of HGT, acquired and donor functions appear to remain closely related. Thus, the degree to which HGT can lead to evolutionary novelties remains unclear. Mucorales fungi sense gravity through the sedimentation of vacuolar protein crystals. Here, we identify the octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN).

Past and contemporary human actions are causing numerous changes in patterns and processes at various ecosystem scales and trophic levels, including unintended downstream changes, such as species interactions. In its native range &lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&lt;/i&gt; (Feijoa) combines some characteristics of human interactions: incipient domestication, restricted to subtropical Atlantic Forest highlands, associated with the threatened conifer &lt;i&gt;Araucaria angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; (Araucaria), within a domesticated landscape with anthropogenic forest patches, and provides fruit at a time of resource shortage (Araucaria seeds—&lt;i&gt;pinhão&lt;/i&gt;). We quantify the trophic relationships between Feijoa and vertebrates, and evaluate the influences on interactions caused by environmental variations, Feijoa domestication evidences, spatial distance and fruit availability. In four sites within protected areas, we selected 28 focal individuals of Feijoa (seven/site) and collected three temporal replicas between 2015 and 2016, when we measured productivity and frugivory via 45-second videos taken with camera traps. Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195199</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3e325446</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juliano André Bogoni, Maurício Eduardo Graipel, Nivaldo Peroni&lt;/p&gt;

Using ecological network, rarefaction curves and variation partitioning analyses, we evaluate the frugivory network topology, the spatiotemporal structure of communities in relation to fruit availability and the influence of predictive variables on frugivory. We found a large spatiotemporal variation in productivity of Feijoa and that 20 species consumed Feijoa fruits, with a species degree of 2.8 (±5.7) and average Feijoa degree of 14.4 (±10.1), in a modular network with intermediary connectance. Rarefaction curves showed that richness and the independent records are congruent with the fruit amount. Variation partitioning showed that, for the focal individuals, canopy area, green coverage, patch size and distance to water influenced frugivory, and the Feijoa domestication influenced significantly the mammalian frugivory. Feijoa is an important resource that provides food during the time of year when &lt;i&gt;Pinhão&lt;/i&gt; is absent, and attracts frugivores, maintain the residual diversity of vertebrates contributing to the structure of communities in highlands. Our insights allowed us to evaluate the magnitude of the interactions between vertebrates and an incipient domesticated tree, in a cultural landscape and highly threatened environment, under a basal foodweb approach with implications for bottom-up and top-down forces. The results contribute to understanding animal-plant relationships, including concepts that can be replicated for other sessile prey and mobile predators in any region or habitat under different gradients of management. Thus, this work shows how human actions can change not only patterns of distribution and abundance but also the diversity and direction of interspecific interactions among species.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195199</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Juliano André Bogoni</name></author><title>The ecological footprint of &amp;lt;i&gt;Acca sellowiana&amp;lt;/i&gt; domestication maintains the residual vertebrate diversity in threatened highlands of Atlantic Forest</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f3:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195199</link><published>1522875600000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026181?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bd1b4b56</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026181?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yoshi-Ichi Suzuki</name></author><title>Communication: Photoionization of degenerate orbitals for randomly oriented molecules: The effect of time-reversal symmetry on recoil-ion momentum angular distributions</title><unread>True</unread><published>1524139352000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d1a:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026181?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195509</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Václav Vavryčuk&lt;/p&gt;
The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers, citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well as research teams.

Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on genetic connectivity among populations remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and in the management and conservation of species. North Pacific hake (&lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&lt;/i&gt;) inhabits upwelling regions in the California Current ecosystem from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this study, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite variation to estimate levels of genetic differentiation of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;productus&lt;/i&gt; in relation to the role of oceanographic features as potential barriers to gene flow. Samples were obtained from nine sites spanning a large part of the geographic range of the species, from Puget Sound, Washington to Costa Rica. The microsatellite results revealed three genetically discrete populations: one spanning the eastern Pacific coast, and two apparently resident populations circumscribed to the Puget Sound and the northern Gulf of California (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.032, p = 0.036). Cytochrome b sequence data indicated that isolation between the Puget Sound and northern Gulf of California populations from the coastal Pacific were recent phenomena (18.5 kyr for Puget Sound and 40 kyr for the northern Gulf of California). Oceanographic data obtained from the Gulf of California support the hypothesis that permanent fronts within the region, and strong gradients at the entrance to the Gulf of California act as barriers to gene flow. A seascape genetics approach found significant genetic–environment associations, where the daytime sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were the best predictive variables for the observed genetic differentiation.

Worldwide, 500,000 cases of head and neck cancer (HNC) are reported each year and the primary treatment for HNC is radiotherapy. Although the goal of radiotherapy is to target the tumor, secondary exposure occurs in surrounding normal tissues, such as the salivary glands. As a result, despite successful treatment of the cancer, patients are left with long-term side effects due to direct damage to the salivary glands. The effect is chronic and currently there is no treatment. Stem cells are an attractive therapeutic option for treatment of radiation-induced glandular dysfunction because of the potential to regenerate damaged cell populations and restore salivary gland function. However, limited knowledge about the endogenous stem cell population post irradiation hinders the development for stem cell-based therapies. In this study, an ex vivo sphere formation cell culture system was utilized to assess the self-renewal capacity of cells derived from parotid salivary glands at a chronic time point following radiation. Salivary glands from irradiated mice generate significantly fewer salispheres, but can be stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to generate an equivalent number of salispheres as unirradiated salivary glands. Interestingly, the number and size of salispheres formed is dependent on the concentration of FBS supplemented into the media. Salispheres derived from irradiated glands and cultured in FBS media were found to contain cells that proliferate and express progenitor and acinar cell markers such as Keratin 5, Keratin 14, Aquaporin 5, and NKCC1. Utilization of insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) injections following radiation treatment restores salivary gland function and improves salisphere generation. These findings indicate that stimulation of these cellular populations may provide a promising avenue for the development of cell-based therapies for radiation-induced salivary gland damage.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193942</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>93bf62c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicky T.

It has been proposed that NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) evolved as an adaptation of microorganisms to grow on acetate as the sole source of carbon and energy. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, changing the cofactor specificity of ICDH from NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cofactor swapping) decreases the growth rate on acetate. However, the metabolic basis of this phenotype has not been analyzed. In this work, we used constraint-based modeling to investigate the effect of the cofactor swapping of ICDH in terms of energy production, response of alternative sources of NADPH, and partitioning of fluxes between ICDH and isocitrate lyase (ICL) -a crucial bifurcation when the bacterium grows on acetate-. We generated &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains expressing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specific ICDH instead of the native enzyme, and bearing the deletion of the NADPH-producing transhydrogenase PntAB. We measured their growth rate and acetate uptake rate, modeled the distribution of metabolic fluxes by Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), and quantified the specific activities of NADPH-producing dehydrogenases in central pathways. The cofactor swapping of ICDH led to one-third decrease in biomass yield, irrespective of the presence of PntAB. According to our simulations, the diminution in growth rate observed upon cofactor swapping could be explained by one-half decrease in the total production of NADPH and a lower availability of carbon for biosynthesis because of a change in the partition at the isocitrate bifurcation. Together with an increased total ATP production, this scenario resulted in a 10-fold increment in the flux of ATP not used for growing purposes. PntAB was identified as the primary NADPH balancing response, with the dehydrogenases of the oxidative branch of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and the malic enzyme playing a role in its absence. We propose that in the context of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; growing on acetate, the NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-specificity of ICDH is a trait that impacts not only NADPH production, but also the efficient allocation of carbon and energy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196182</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f3dd3826</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Erick Armingol, Eduardo Tobar, Ricardo Cabrera&lt;/p&gt;

Following the indication of the World Health Organization, a national plan for the elimination of measles was approved in Italy and this included the improvement of the molecular surveillance of measles viruses and the interruption of indigenous transmission of the disease. Nevertheless, large outbreaks continue to occur in almost all regions of the country, including Sicily. Here we describe the epidemiology and molecular dynamics of measles viruses as a result of the measles surveillance activity carried out by the “Reference Laboratory for Measles and Rubella” in Sicily over a 5-year period. Biological samples of 259 suspected measles cases were tested for viral RNA detection and a total of 223 (86.1%) were classified as laboratory confirmed. The median age of confirmed measles cases was 21.0 years and about half of them were adults aged 19 years and older. Overall, one-third of the patients showed clinical complications and these latter were more common among adults than children (44.9% &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. 25.7%). The vast majority of measles cases were unvaccinated (94.2%, n = 210). The phylogenetic analysis of 221 measles virus nucleotide sequences revealed sporadic detections of genotypes D4 and H1, while endemic circulation of genotypes D8 and B3 was documented. Genotype D8 was associated with epidemics occurred between 2013 and 2016, whereas genotype B3 was more recently introduced into Sicily characterizing the current measles outbreak. The results of this study confirm the autochthonous co-circulation of viral variants belonging to different genotypes during the study period, and emphasizes the need of measles surveillance programmes in order to investigate the viral dynamics, the pathways of disease transmission, and to eventually adapt the development of successfull vaccine formulations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195256</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b8c64933</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Tramuto, Carmelo Massimo Maida, Fanny Pojero, Giuseppina Maria Elena Colomba, Alessandra Casuccio, Vincenzo Restivo, Francesco Vitale&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether preoperative breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging kinetic features, assessed using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), can predict survival outcome and tumor aggressiveness in patients with invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between March and December 2011, 301 women who underwent preoperative DCE MR imaging for invasive breast cancer, with CAD data, were identified. All MR images were retrospectively evaluated using a commercially available CAD system. The following kinetic parameters were prospectively recorded for each lesion: initial peak enhancement, the proportion of early phase medium and rapid enhancement, and the proportion of delayed phase persistent, plateau, and washout enhancement. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between the kinetic features assessed by CAD and disease-free survival (DFS). The peak signal intensity and kinetic enhancement profiles were compared with the clinical-pathological variables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 32 recurrences during a mean follow-up time of 55.2 months (range, 5–72 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher peak enhancement (DFS hazard ratio, 1.004 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001, 1.006]; &lt;i&gt;P =&lt;/i&gt; .013) on DCE MR imaging and a triple-negative subtype (DFS hazard ratio, 21.060 [95% CI: 2.675, 165.780]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .004) were associated with a poorer DFS. Higher peak enhancement was significantly associated with a higher tumor stage, clinical stage, and histologic grade.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with breast cancer who showed higher CAD-derived peak enhancement on breast MR imaging had worse DFS.

Peak enhancement and volumetric analysis of kinetic patterns were useful for predicting tumor aggressiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195756</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sang Yu Nam</name></author><title>Preoperative dynamic breast magnetic resonance imaging kinetic features using computer-aided diagnosis: Association with survival outcome and tumor aggressiveness in patients with invasive breast cancer</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c1:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195756</link><published>1523566800000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24789-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24789-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24789-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/GkAwwxubs_o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24789-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24789-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/GkAwwxubs_o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523868473584</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>66f23da3</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24789-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/GkAwwxubs_o/s41598-018-24789-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yunnan Fang</name></author><title>Author Correction: Sensitivity enhancement of flexible gas sensors via conversion of inkjet-printed silver electrodes into porous gold counterparts</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cda398f0:2887000:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24789-y</link><published>1523862000000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01593/20180406/images/medium/jm-2017-01593c_0015.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01593&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is increasingly being used to treat rapidly progressing or severe cardiogenic shock. However, it has been repeatedly shown that increased afterload associated with ECLS significantly diminishes left ventricular (LV) performance. The objective of the present study was to compare LV function and coronary flow during standard continuous-flow ECLS support and electrocardiogram (ECG)-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixteen female swine (mean body weight 45 kg) underwent ECLS implantation under general anesthesia and artificial ventilation. Subsequently, acute cardiogenic shock, with documented signs of tissue hypoperfusion, was induced by initiating global myocardial hypoxia. Hemodynamic cardiac performance variables and coronary flow were then measured at different rates of continuous or pulsatile ECLS flow (ranging from 1 L/min to 4 L/min) using arterial and venous catheters, a pulmonary artery catheter, an LV pressure-volume loop catheter, and a Doppler coronary guide-wire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Myocardial hypoxia resulted in declines in mean cardiac output to 1.7±0.7 L/min, systolic blood pressure to 64±22 mmHg, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) to 22±7%. Synchronized pulsatile flow was associated with a significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume by 6.2 mL (6.7%), an increase in LV stroke volume by 5.0 mL (17.4%), higher LVEF by 4.5% (18.8% relative), cardiac output by 0.37 L/min (17.1%), and mean arterial pressure by 3.0 mmHg (5.5%) when compared with continuous ECLS flow at all ECLS flow rates (P&amp;lt;0.05). At selected ECLS flow rates, pulsatile flow also reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic volume, and systolic pressure. ECG-synchronized pulsatile flow was also associated with significantly increased (7% to 22%) coronary flow at all ECLS flow rates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ECG-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow preserved LV function and coronary flow compared with standard continuous-flow ECLS in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196321</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5bd68969</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Petr Ostadal, Mikulas Mlcek, Holger Gorhan, Ivo Simundic, Svitlana Strunina, Matej Hrachovina, Andreas Krüger, Dagmar Vondrakova, Marek Janotka, Pavel Hala, Martin Mates, Martin Ostadal, James C.

Land managers increasingly rely upon landscape assessments to understand the status of natural resources and identify conservation priorities. Many of these landscape planning efforts rely on geospatial models that characterize the ecological integrity of the landscape. These general models utilize measures of habitat disturbance and human activity to map indices of ecological integrity. We built upon these modeling frameworks by developing a Landscape Integrity Index (&lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt;) model using geospatial datasets of the human footprint, as well as incorporation of other indicators of ecological integrity such as biodiversity and vegetation departure. Our &lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt; model serves as a general indicator of ecological integrity in a regional context of human activity, biodiversity, and change in habitat composition. We also discuss the application of the &lt;i&gt;LII&lt;/i&gt; framework in two related coarse-filter landscape conservation approaches to expand the size and connectedness of protected areas as regional mitigation for anticipated land-use changes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195115</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4ee655d6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leroy J.

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194963</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>394e370c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent. Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195602</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d22e6c56</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine Gebhard, Caroline E.

The development of models of macromolecular electrostatics capable of delivering improved fidelity to quantum mechanical calculations is an active field of research in computational chemistry. Most molecular force field development takes place in the context of models with full Cartesian coordinate degrees of freedom. Nevertheless, a number of macromolecular modeling programs use a reduced set of conformational variables limited to rotatable bonds. Efficient algorithms for minimizing the energies of macromolecular systems with torsional degrees of freedom have been developed with the assumption that all atom-atom interaction potentials are isotropic. We describe novel modifications to address the anisotropy of higher order multipole terms while retaining the efficiency of these approaches. In addition, we present a treatment for obtaining derivatives of atom-centered tensors with respect to torsional degrees of freedom. We apply these results to enable minimization of the Amoeba multipole electrostatics potential in a system with torsional degrees of freedom, and validate the correctness of the gradients by comparison to finite difference approximations. In the interest of enabling a complete model of electrostatics with implicit treatment of solvent-mediated effects, we also derive expressions for the derivative of solvent accessible surface area with respect to torsional degrees of freedom.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195578</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1535c7db</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas K.

The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions. One of the challenges of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; annotations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vascular calcification is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, no viable treatments for this condition have been identified. This study aimed to determine whether farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can reduce vascular calcification and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that FTI-277 significantly inhibits phosphate-induced mineral deposition by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, prevents VSMC osteogenic differentiation, and increases mRNA expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), an inhibitor of mineralization. FTI-277 increases Akt signaling in VSMC in short-term serum-stimulation assays and in long-term mineralization assays. In contrast, manumycin A has no effect on Akt signaling or mineralization. Co-incubation of VSMC with FTI-277 and SH6 (an Akt inhibitor) significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of FTI-277 on mineralization, demonstrating that FTI-277 inhibits calcification by activating Akt signaling. Over-expression of the constitutively active p110 sub-unit of PI3K in VSMC using adenovirus activates Akt, inhibits mineralization, suppresses VSMC differentiation and significantly enhances MGP mRNA expression. FTI-277 also inhibits phosphate-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of VSMC, and these effects are negated by co-incubation with SH6. Finally, using an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; model of vascular calcification, we demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits high phosphate-induced mineralization in aortic rings derived from rats with end-stage renal failure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Together, these results demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits VSMC mineral deposition by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that targeting farnesylation, or Akt specifically, may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>591c9e3f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arvind Ponnusamy, Smeeta Sinha, Gareth D.

Perforant-path (PP) synapses on hippocampal granule cells (GCs) contribute to the formation of associative memories, which are considered the cellular correlates of memory engrams. However, the mechanisms of LTP at these synapses are not well understood. Due to sparse firing activity and the voltage attenuation in their dendrites, it remains unclear how associative LTP at distal synapses occurs. Here we show that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP can be induced at PP-GC synapses without backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) in acute rat brain slices.

Perforant-path (PP) synapses on hippocampal granule cells (GCs) contribute to the formation of associative memories, which are considered the cellular correlates of memory engrams. However, the mechanisms of LTP at these synapses are not well understood. Due to sparse firing activity and the voltage attenuation in their dendrites, it remains unclear how associative LTP at distal synapses occurs. Here we show that NMDA receptor-dependent LTP can be induced at PP-GC synapses without backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) in acute rat brain slices. Dendritic recordings reveal substantial attenuation of bAPs as well as local dendritic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spike generation during PP-GC input. Inhibition of dendritic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes impairs LTP induction at PP-GC synapse. These data suggest that dendritic spikes may constitute a key cellular mechanism for memory formation in the dentate gyrus.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269316v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Hundreds of thousands of human whole genome sequencing (WGS) datasets will be generated over the next few years to interrogate a broad range of traits, across diverse populations.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Demographic change has led to an increase of older people in need of long-term care in nearly all European countries. Informal carers primarily provide the care and support needed by dependent people. The supply and willingness of individuals to act as carers are critical to sustain informal care resources as part of the home health care provision. This paper describes a longitudinal study of informal care in six European countries and reports analyses that determine those factors predicting the outcomes of family care over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analyses are based on data from the EUROFAMCARE project, a longitudinal survey study of family carers of older people with baseline data collection in 2004 and follow-up data collection a year later in six European countries (Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), N = 3,348. Descriptive statistics of the sample characteristics are reported. Binary logistic random-intercept regressions were computed, predicting the outcome of change of the care dyad’s status at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Where care is provided by a more distant family member or by a friend or neighbour, the care-recipient is significantly more likely to be cared for by someone else (OR 1.62) or to be in residential care (OR 3.37) after one year. The same holds true if the care-recipient has memory problems with a dementia diagnosis (OR 1.79/OR 1.84). Higher dependency (OR 1.22) and behavioural problems (OR 1.76) in the care-recipient also lead to a change of care dyad status. Country of residence explained a relatively small amount of variance (8%) in whether a care-recipient was cared for by someone else after one year, but explained a substantial amount of variance (52%) in whether a care-recipient was in residential care. Particularly in Sweden, care-recipients are much more likely to be cared for by another family or professional carer or to be in residential care, whereas in Greece the status of the care dyad is much less likely to change.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The majority of family carers continued to provide care to their respective older relatives over a one-year period, despite often high levels of functional, cognitive and behavioural problems in the care-recipient. Those family carers could benefit most from appropriate support. The carer/care-recipient relationship plays an important role in whether or not a family care dyad remains intact over a one-year period. The support of health and social care services should be particularly targeted toward those care dyads where there is no partner or spouse acting as carer, or no extended family network that might absorb the caring role when required. Distant relatives, friends or acquaintances who are acting as carers might need substantial intervention if their caregiving role is to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195294</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f6f92326</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Lüdecke, Barbara Bien, Kevin McKee, Barbro Krevers, Elizabeth Mestheneos, Mirko Di Rosa, Olaf von dem Knesebeck, Christopher Kofahl&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease remains controversial. Recently, the PLEASE study did not demonstrate any additional clinical benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic treatment. However, the economic impact of the antibiotic strategies has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651). For every willingness-to-pay threshold, the incremental net monetary benefits did not significantly differ from zero.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The longer-term treatments were similar with regard to costs, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness compared to shorter-term treatment in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms after one year of follow-up. Given the results of this study, and taking into account the external costs associated with antibiotic resistance, the shorter-term treatment is the antibiotic regimen of first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195260</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fd66eebf</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anneleen Berende, Lisette Nieuwenhuis, Hadewych J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing. The use of beta-blockers increased markedly, while use of digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drugs decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b6d29348</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Dalgaard, Martin H.

Although significant attention has been devoted to analyzing stigma associated with epilepsy, there is still a significant lack of valid and reliable instruments. We aimed to validate the 23-item Czech version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE; originally developed in Brazil), which has been used to evaluate epilepsy-related stigma in the general population. Verification of the SSE questionnaire was carried out in a group of 207 students aged 15–18 years of whom none had epilepsy. These students completed the SSE twice in a period of 3–6 months as part of standard test-retest evaluation practice. The instrument exhibits good psychometric properties including internal consistency higher than in the original version (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.856 here compared with 0.81 reported in Brazil) and acceptable test-retest reliability. Using exploratory factor analysis (not provided for the original version), four factors were identified and corresponding subscales were described and interpreted. Two items did not fit into the structure and were eliminated. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to propose and verify the hierarchical 4-factor structure of the Czech version of SSE confirming the existence of a common factor corresponding to stigma. The results showed that the Czech version of SSE has good psychometric properties and can be used in further research and clinical practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195225</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a2b21182</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dana Brabcová, Jiří Kohout, Daniel Potužák, Barbora Beňová, Pavel Kršek&lt;/p&gt;

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194853</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3af0ee32</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3D) digitization technique for natural objects, such as insects and plants. The key idea is to combine X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photographs to obtain both complicated 3D shapes and surface textures of target specimens. We measure a specimen by using an X-ray CT device and a digital camera to obtain a CT volumetric image (volume) and multiple photographs. We then reconstruct a 3D model by segmenting the CT volume and generate a texture by projecting the photographs onto the model. To achieve this reconstruction, we introduce a technique for estimating a camera position for each photograph. We also present techniques for merging multiple textures generated from multiple photographs and recovering missing texture areas caused by occlusion. We illustrate the feasibility of our 3D digitization technique by digitizing 3D textured models of insects and flowers. The combination of X-ray CT and a digital camera makes it possible to successfully digitize specimens with complicated 3D structures accurately and allows us to browse both surface colors and internal structures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195852</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>76ea1616</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ijiri, Hideki Todo, Akira Hirabayashi, Kenji Kohiyama, Yoshinori Dobashi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Achondroplasia is a rare genetic disease is characterized by abnormal bone development and early obesity. While the bone aspect of the disease has been thoroughly studied, early obesity affecting approximately 50% of them during childhood has been somewhat neglected. It nevertheless represents a major health problem in these patients, and is associated to life-threatening complications including increasing risk of cardiovascular pathologies. We have thus decided to study obesity in patients and to use the mouse model to evaluate if soluble FGFR3 therapy, an innovative treatment approach for achondroplasia, could also impact the development of this significant complication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we have first fully characterized the metabolic deregulations in these patients by conducting a longitudinal retrospective study, in children with achondroplasia Anthropometric, densitometric measures as well as several blood parameters were recorded and compared between three age groups ranging from [0–3], [4–8] and [9–18] years old. Our results show unexpected results with the development of an atypical obesity with preferential fat deposition in the abdomen that is remarkably not associated with classical complications of obesity such as diabetes or hypercholosterolemia. Because it is not associated with diabetes, the atypical obesity has not been studied in the past even though it is recognized as a real problem in these patients. These results were validated in a murine model of achondroplasia (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt;) where similar visceral adiposity was observed. Unexpected alterations in glucose metabolism were highlighted during high-fat diet. Glucose, insulin or lipid levels remained low, without the development of diabetes. Very interestingly, in achondroplasia mice treated with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period (from D3 to D22), the development of these metabolic deregulations was prevented in adult animals (between 4 and 14 weeks of age). The lean-over-fat tissues ratio was restored and glucose metabolism showed normal levels. Treating &lt;i&gt;Fgfr3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ach/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice with soluble FGFR3 during the growth period, prevented the development of these metabolic deregulations in adult animals and restored lean-over-fat tissues ratio as well as glucose metabolism in adult animals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrate that achondroplasia patients develop an atypical obesity with preferential abdominal obesity not associated with classical complications. These results suggest that achondroplasia induces an uncommon metabolism of energy, directly linked to the FGFR3 mutation. These data strongly suggest that this common complication of achondroplasia should be included in the clinical management of patients. In this context, sFGFR3 proved to be a promising treatment for achondroplasia by normalizing the biology at different levels, not only restoring bone growth but also preventing the atypical visceral obesity and some metabolic deregulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195876</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8c4a69f3</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Celine Saint-Laurent, Stephanie Garcia, Vincent Sarrazy, Karine Dumas, Florence Authier, Sophie Sore, Albert Tran, Philippe Gual, Isabelle Gennero, Jean-Pierre Salles, Elvire Gouze&lt;/p&gt;

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition characterised by pancreatic beta cell destruction and absolute insulin deficiency. The strongest predictor of diabetes complications is glycaemic control and achieving HbA1c ≤ 7.0% is the primary management target. However, standard treatment appears to be lacking and adjunctive strategies require consideration. A systematic review was conducted to examine the effect of low-carbohydrate diets on type 1 diabetes management. Four databases were searched from inception until 28 March 2017: MEDLINE; CINAHL; Cochrane Library; and EMBASE. All primary studies containing a methods section (excluding cross-sectional) were included. Reports had to quantitatively measure the effect(s) of a dietary intervention or observed intake over at least two weeks where carbohydrate is below 45% total energy in adults and/or children with type 1 diabetes. The primary outcome was HbA1c and secondary outcomes were severe hypoglycaemia, total daily insulin, BMI, quality of life and mean daily glucose. Seventy-nine full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and nine were included (two randomised controlled trials, four pre-post interventions, two case-series, one case-report). Eight studies reported a mean change in HbA1c with a low-carbohydrate diet. Of these, four reported a non-significant change (P ≥ 0.05) and three reported statistically significant reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Two studies reported severe hypoglycaemia, five reported total insulin, three reported BMI, and one reported blood glucose. Due to the significant heterogeneity of included studies, an overall effect could not be determined. This review presents all available evidence on low-carbohydrate diets for type 1 diabetes and suggests an urgent need for more primary studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194987</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>30b1893b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica L.

&lt;i&gt;Dactylis glomerata&lt;/i&gt; L. (orchardgrass) is an important perennial forage species in temperate areas of the world. It is usually used for silage, grazing and hay because of its high nutritional value and reproducibility. Central Asia, Xinjiang and Tibetan Plateau in China possess various special micro-environments that harbor many valuable resources, while different degrees of degradation of the grassland ecosystem occurred due to climatic changing and human activities. Investigating the genetic diversity of wild &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glomerat&lt;/i&gt; could provide basis for collection, protection, and utilization of some excellent germplasm resources. Totally 210 individuals from 14 populations—five from Xinjiang, two from Kangding (Tibetan Plateau), and seven from Central Asia were identified using AFLP technology. The average values of Nei’s genetic diversity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) and Shannon information index (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) were 0.383 and 0.394 respectively. UPGMA tree, STRUCTURE analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed populations from same region clustered together.

Gene flow (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) was limited among all populations. Genetic diversity of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glomerata&lt;/i&gt; was high but limited under isolation-by-distance pattern, resulting in high genetic differentiation and low gene flow among populations.

The environmental factors, such as precipitation, elevation, latitude and longitude also had some impacts on genetic diversity and structure pattern of populations.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195273</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chenglin Zhang</name></author><title>AFLP-based genetic diversity of wild orchardgrass germplasm collections from Central Asia and Western China, and the relation to environmental factors</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd87:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195273</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f18f43ae</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Carmen Lucía Moraila-Martínez</name></author><title>An experimental/theoretical method to measure the capacitive compactness of an aqueous electrolyte surrounding a spherical charged colloid</title><unread>True</unread><published>1524139350000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d18:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024553?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24154-z</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fluorophore labeling of a cell-penetrating peptide significantly alters the mode and degree of biomembrane interaction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorophore labeling of a cell-penetrating peptide significantly alters the mode and degree of biomembrane interaction, Published online: 20 April 2018;

Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) and the cliff swallow (&lt;i&gt;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)&lt;/i&gt;. BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195467</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bdc671fd</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carol A.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

Currently approved monoamine modulating antidepressant and anxiolytic pharmaceutics fail in over one third of patients due to delayed and variable therapeutic effect, adverse reactions preceding the therapeutic action, and adherence issues. Even with adequate adherence to the regimen and tolerability, one third of the patients do not respond to any class of antidepressants. There is a strong correlation between treatment resistant depression and increase in inflammatory cytokines in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that depression and anxiety are commonly comorbid with pain and inflammation. While a link between pain, inflammation and depression has been suggested it remains unclear which anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial to patients with depression and anxiety due to pain. Here, we analyzed 430,783 FDA adverse effect reports of patients treated for pain to identify potential antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of various anti-inflammatory medications. Patients treated for depression or patients taking any known antidepressants were excluded. The odds ratio analysis of 139,072 NSAID reports revealed that ketoprofen was associated with decreased reports of depression by a factor of 2.32 (OR 0.43 and 95% Confidence Interval [0.31, 0.59]) and decreased reports of anxiety by a factor of 2.86 (OR 0.35 [0.22, 0.56]), diclofenac with decreased depression reports by a factor of 2.22 (OR 0.45 [0.40, 0.49]) and anxiety by a factor of 2.13 (OR 0.47 [0.41, 0.54]), while naproxen decreased depression reports by a factor of 1.92 (OR 0.52 [0.49, 0.57]) and anxiety by a factor of 1.23 (OR 0.81 [0.75, 0.88]).

&lt;i&gt;Paullinia cupana&lt;/i&gt; is associated with a diverse community of pathogenic and endophytic microorganisms. We isolated and identified endophytic fungal communities from the roots and seeds of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cupana&lt;/i&gt; genotypes susceptible and tolerant to anthracnose that grow in two sites of the Brazilian Amazonia forest. We assessed the antibacterial, antitumor and genotoxic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; of compounds isolated from the strains &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma asperellum&lt;/i&gt; (1BDA) and &lt;i&gt;Diaporthe phaseolorum&lt;/i&gt; (8S). In concert, we identified eight fungal species not previously reported as endophytes; some fungal species capable of inhibiting pathogen growth; and the production of antibiotics and compounds with bacteriostatic activity against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in both susceptible and multiresistant host strains.

&lt;i&gt;Paullinia cupana&lt;/i&gt; is associated with a diverse community of pathogenic and endophytic microorganisms. We isolated and identified endophytic fungal communities from the roots and seeds of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cupana&lt;/i&gt; genotypes susceptible and tolerant to anthracnose that grow in two sites of the Brazilian Amazonia forest. We assessed the antibacterial, antitumor and genotoxic activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; of compounds isolated from the strains &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma asperellum&lt;/i&gt; (1BDA) and &lt;i&gt;Diaporthe phaseolorum&lt;/i&gt; (8S). In concert, we identified eight fungal species not previously reported as endophytes; some fungal species capable of inhibiting pathogen growth; and the production of antibiotics and compounds with bacteriostatic activity against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in both susceptible and multiresistant host strains. The plant genotype, geographic location and specially the organ influenced the composition of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cupana&lt;/i&gt; endophytic fungal community. Together, our findings identify important functional roles of endophytic species found within the microbiome of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cupana&lt;/i&gt;.

The molecular mechanisms through which dendritic cells (DCs) prime T helper 2 (Th2) responses, including those elicited by parasitic helminths, remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that soluble egg antigen (SEA) from &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, which is well known to drive potent Th2 responses, triggers DCs to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which subsequently—in an autocrine manner—induces OX40 ligand (OX40L) expression to license these DCs to drive Th2 responses. Mechanistically, SEA was found to promote PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis through Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, and via a downstream signaling cascade involving spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2). In addition, this pathway was activated independently of the actions of omega-1 (ω-1), a previously described Th2-priming glycoprotein present in SEA. These findings were supported by in vivo murine data showing that ω-1–independent Th2 priming by SEA was mediated by Dectin-2 and Syk signaling in DCs. Finally, we found that Dectin-2&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;, and to a lesser extent Dectin-1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice, displayed impaired Th2 responses and reduced egg-driven granuloma formation following &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; infection, highlighting the physiological importance of this pathway in Th2 polarization during a helminth infection. In summary, we identified a novel pathway in DCs involving Dectin-1/2-Syk-PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-OX40L through which Th2 immune responses are induced.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JxCwEstI3Wg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria M.

How do we rapidly process incoming streams of information in working memory, a cognitive mechanism central to human behavior? Dominant views of working memory focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but human hippocampal recordings provide a neurophysiological signature distinct from the PFC. Are these regions independent, or do they interact in the service of working memory? We addressed this core issue in behavior by recording directly from frontotemporal sites in humans performing a visuospatial working memory task that operationalizes the types of identity and spatiotemporal information we encounter every day. Theta band oscillations drove bidirectional interactions between the PFC and medial temporal lobe (MTL; including the hippocampus). MTL theta oscillations directed the PFC preferentially during the processing of spatiotemporal information, while PFC theta oscillations directed the MTL for all types of information being processed in working memory. These findings reveal an MTL theta mechanism for processing space and time and a domain-general PFC theta mechanism, providing evidence that rapid, dynamic MTL–PFC interactions underlie working memory for everyday experiences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5Z-HrtFgn-8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth L.

We show that the network can be trained efficiently from simple cell centroid annotations, and that the final segmentation provides accurate detection and smooth segmentations, without introducing cell splitting or merging.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/297689v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Thierbach, K.</name></author><title>Deep Learning meets Topology-preserving Active Contours: towards scalable quantitative histology of cortical cytoarchitecture.

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications. Sensitisation of patients and caregivers during admission on the implication of non-adherence, as well as interventions that monitor and provide feedback mechanisms on patients’ medication taking behaviour holds promise for maximising diabetes and hypertensive medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193995</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>14c67ba6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roger A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Sleep disordered breathing is a common but often undiagnosed comorbidity in heart failure patients. Cardiac implantable electronic devices used for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may detect sleep apnea by use of a transthoracic impedance sensor. Validation of the AP scan® algorithm (Boston Scientific®) was performed by using the diagnostic gold standard polysomnography (PSG).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-one patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, frequent right ventricular pacing due to atrioventricular block and heart failure symptoms despite optimal medical therapy underwent upgrading to biventricular pacing. Within one month after left ventricular lead implantation, sleep apnea was assessed by single-night PSG and AP scan® measurements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;AP scan® measurements were valid in only 21 of 41 (51.2%) patients in the index night of the PSG. The PSG determined apnea-hypopnea index did not correlate statistically significant with the AP scan® measurements (r = 0.41, 95% confidence interval -0.05–0.72, p = 0.07). The degree of overestimation is displayed by using the Bland-Altman method: mean difference -12.4, standard deviation ± 15.8, 95% confidence interval -43.3–18.6.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In heart failure patients receiving CRT upgrading, the AP scan® algorithm may need further improvement before it can be recommended for sleep apnea detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195573</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5406c201</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabian Barbieri, Wolfgang Dichtl, Anna Heidbreder, Elisabeth Brandauer, Ambra Stefani, Agne Adukauskaite, Thomas Senoner, Wilfried Schgör, Florian Hintringer, Birgit Högl&lt;/p&gt;

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194994</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2b113486</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194209</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>11fd5c8c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Geraint P.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195413</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c5d67f74</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rana Jajou, Albert de Neeling, Rianne van Hunen, Gerard de Vries, Henrieke Schimmel, Arnout Mulder, Richard Anthony, Wim van der Hoek, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195413</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Rana Jajou</name></author><title>Epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases identified twice as efficiently by whole genome sequencing than conventional molecular typing: A population-based study</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57603:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195413</link><published>1522875600000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194502</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Assunta Biscotti, Marco Barucca, Adriana Canapa&lt;/p&gt;
Repetitive DNA represents the major component of the genome in both plant and animal species.

We investigate the influence of the visual appearance of a negotiator on persuasiveness within the context of negotiations. Psychological experiments were conducted to quantitatively analyze the relationship between visual appearance and the use of language. Male and female participants were shown three female and male photographs, respectively. They were asked to report how they felt about each photograph using a seven-point semantic differential (SD) scale for six affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness). Participants then answered how they felt about each negotiation scenario (they were presented with pictures and a situation combined with negotiation sentences) using a seven-point SD scale for seven affective factors (positive impression, extraversion, intelligence, conscientiousness, emotional stability, agreeableness, and degree of persuasion). Two experiments were conducted using different participant groups depending on the negotiation situations. Photographs with good or bad appearances were found to show high or low degrees of persuasion, respectively. A multiple regression equation was obtained, indicating the importance of the three language factors (euphemistic, honorific, and sympathy expressions) to impressions made during negotiation. The result shows that there are optimal negotiation sentences based on various negotiation factors, such as visual appearance and use of language. For example, persons with good appearance might worsen their impression during negotiations by using certain language, although their initial impression was positive, and persons with bad appearance could effectively improve their impressions in negotiations through their use of language, although the final impressions of their negotiation counterpart might still be more negative than those for persons with good appearance. In contrast, the impressions made by persons of normal appearance were not easily affected by their use of language. The results of the present study have significant implications for future studies of effective negotiation strategies considering visual appearance as well as gender.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195496</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c300347c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maki Sakamoto, Jinhwan Kwon, Hikaru Tamada, Yumi Hirahara&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50).

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiac autonomic neuropathy in type 2 dibetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is frequent and associated with high cardiovascular mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the gold standard to measure cardiac autonomic neuropathy. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta–analysis to evaluate the impact of T2DM on HRV parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched on 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; October 2017 using the keywords “diabetes” AND (“heart rate variability” OR “HRV”). Included articles had to report HRV parameters in T2DM patients and healthy controls measured during 24 hours with a Holter–electrocardiogram. Measurements of HRV retieved were: RR–intervals (or Normal to Normal intervals—NN), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), percetange of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 milliseconds (pNN50), square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD), total power, Low Frequency (LF), High Frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio, as per Task Force recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included twenty-five case-control studies with 2,932 patients: 1,356 with T2DM and 1,576 healthy controls. T2DM patients had significantly (P&amp;lt;0.01) lower RR–intervals (effect size = –0.61; 95%CI –1.21 to –0.01), lower SDNN (–0.65; –0.83 to –0.47), lower RMSSD (–0.92; –1.37 to –0.47), lower pNN50 (–0.46; –0.84 to –0.09), lower total power (–1.52; –2.13 to –0.91), lower LF (–1.08; –1.46 to –0.69]), and lower HF (–0.79; –1.09 to –0.50). LF/HF did not differ between groups. Levels of blood glucose and HbA1c were associated with several HRV parameters, as well as Time from diagnosis of T2DM&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;T2DM was associated with an overall decrease in the HRV of T2DM patients.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195507</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>968614f6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Macrophages are immune cells that compose the first line of an organism&apos;s defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of TB. Interactions between macrophages and M.tb define the infection outcome. Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that activate transcription of target genes and mediate various responses in macrophages. To what extent the host&apos;s genetic response to infection is controlled by enhancers remains unexplored. We analysed the regulation by transcribed enhancers in M.tb-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that transcribed enhancers have a strong influence in the M.tb infection response and mediate up-regulation of many important immune genes. We characterise highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and show that many genes acquire de novo transcribed enhancers upon M.tb infection. We report enhancers targeting known immune genes crucial for the host&apos;s genetic response to M.tb, such as Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Irg1, Hilpda, Ccl3, and Ccl4, and highlight transcription factors that are likely regulating these enhancers including AP-1, NF-kB, Irf1, and Rbpj. Finally, we highlight particular chromosomal domains carrying groups of highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and genes with previously unappreciated roles in M.tb infection, such as Fbxl3, Tapt1, Edn1, and Hivep1. Our study links M.tb-responsive transcription factors to activation of transcribed enhancers, which, in turn, target protein-coding immune genes upon infection. We find that many genes who respond with increased expression to M.tb are under the control of transcribed enhancers. Our findings extend current knowledge of M.tb-response regulation in macrophages and provide a basis for future functional studies on enhancer-gene interactions in this process.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/303552</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524042617378</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b31184a2</fingerprint><description>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health threat and cause of death worldwide.

We characterise highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and show that many genes acquire de novo transcribed enhancers upon M.tb infection. We report enhancers targeting known immune genes crucial for the host&apos;s genetic response to M.tb, such as Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Irg1, Hilpda, Ccl3, and Ccl4, and highlight transcription factors that are likely regulating these enhancers including AP-1, NF-kB, Irf1, and Rbpj. Finally, we highlight particular chromosomal domains carrying groups of highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and genes with previously unappreciated roles in M.tb infection, such as Fbxl3, Tapt1, Edn1, and Hivep1. Our study links M.tb-responsive transcription factors to activation of transcribed enhancers, which, in turn, target protein-coding immune genes upon infection. We find that many genes who respond with increased expression to M.tb are under the control of transcribed enhancers. Our findings extend current knowledge of M.tb-response regulation in macrophages and provide a basis for future functional studies on enhancer-gene interactions in this process.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Denisenko, E.</name></author><title>Transcribed enhancers in the macrophage immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162d804d222:38bb02b:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</link><published>1524034800000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195210</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyun-Jung Lee, Eue-Keun Choi, Seung-Hwan Lee, Yong-Jin Kim, Kyung-Do Han, Seil Oh&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Whether metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are at increased risk of ischemic stroke is not well known. We investigated the association of the MHO phenotype with ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 354,083 adults (age 45.8 ± 14.2 years) from the Korean National Health Insurance Service–National Sample Cohort enrolled in 2004–2008 were followed-up for incident ischemic stroke until 2013. Subjects meeting none of the metabolic syndrome criteria were classified as ‘metabolically healthy’. The cohort was categorized into four groups according to obesity and metabolic status: metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), metabolically unhealthy normal weight (MUNW), MHO, and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 4,884 (1.4%) individuals during a mean follow-up of 7.4 ± 1.5 years. Stroke incidence rates for the MHNW, MUNW, MHO, and MUO groups were 0.56, 2.61, 0.61, and 2.76 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. While risk for stroke increased significantly in metabolically unhealthy groups, it was not increased in MHO compared to the MHNW group on multivariate analysis. In metabolically healthy individuals, obesity did not increase the risk for ischemic stroke, regardless of the severity of obesity. Meanwhile, in metabolically unhealthy individuals, being obese was significantly associated with increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MHO individuals were not at increased risk for ischemic stroke. However, obesity increased risk for ischemic stroke in persons with metabolic risk factors; therefore, maintaining normal weight may be more important for this population.

Recent vaccine studies with experimental antigens have shown that regulatory T cells (Tregs) constrain the magnitude of B cell responses. This homeostatic Treg-mediated suppression is thought to reduce the potential of germinal center (GC) responses to generate autoreactive antibodies. However, essentially opposite results were observed in live influenza infections where Tregs promoted B cell and antibody responses. Thus, it remains unclear whether Tregs dampen or enhance B cell responses, especially during live viral infections. Here, we use mice infected with Friend retrovirus (FV), which induces a robust expansion of Tregs. Depletion of Tregs led to elevated activation, proliferation, and class switching of B cells. In addition, Treg depletion enhanced the production of virus-specific and virus-neutralizing antibodies and reduced FV viremia. Thus, in contrast to influenza infection, Tregs either directly or indirectly suppress B cells during mouse retroviral infection indicating that the ultimate effect of Tregs on B cell responses is specific to the particular infectious agent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195402</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a8213765</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tyler C.

Epidemiological studies have revealed that noise exposure was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the exact nature of that association remains to be elucidated. The present study is designed to examine the effects of chronic noise exposure on the development of T2DM in combination with a high-fat-diet (HFD) in mice. Here we show that chronic noise exposure at 85 dB SPL (4 h /day, below the safety limit for occupational noise exposure) exaggerated multiple metabolic abnormalities induced by HFD in C57BL/6J male mice, including worsened glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, fasting hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, noise exposure exhibited a paradoxical impact on fat accumulation and circulating levels of free fatty acid, indicating a potential stimulating effect of noise on lipolysis. These results provide first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195411</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4b198f0e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lijie Liu, Yi Huang, Cong Fang, Hongyu Zhang, Jing Yang, Chuanying Xuan, Fanfan Wang, Haiying Lu, Shuangfeng Cao, Yongfang Wang, Shengwei Li, Jun Sha, Mingming Zha, Min Guo, Jian Wang&lt;/p&gt;

These results provide first &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; supporting evidence for the causative role of noise exposure in diabetogenesis and pinpoint a noise-associated increase in blood free fatty acid levels as a possible mediator accelerating the effect of noise on the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195411</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lijie Liu</name></author><title>Chronic noise-exposure exacerbates insulin resistance and promotes the manifestations of the type 2 diabetes in a high-fat diet mouse model</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522443600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c5c:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195411</link><published>1522443600000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

Increasing evidence indicates that the Golgi apparatus plays active roles in cancer, but a comprehensive understanding of its functions in the oncogenic transformation has not yet emerged. At the same time, the Golgi is becoming well recognized as a hub that integrates its functions of protein and lipid biosynthesis to signal transduction for cell proliferation and migration in cancer cells. Nevertheless, the active function of the Golgi apparatus in cancer cells has not been fully evaluated as a target for combined treatment. Here, we analyzed the effect of perturbing the Golgi apparatus on the sensitivity of the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line to the drugs Actinomycin D and Vinblastine. We disrupted the function of ARF1, a protein necessary for the homeostasis of the Golgi apparatus. We found that the expression of the ARF1-Q71L mutant increased the sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells to both Actinomycin D and Vinblastine, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and cell migration, as well as in increased apoptosis. Likewise, the combined treatment of cells with Actinomycin D or Vinblastine and Brefeldin A or Golgicide A, two disrupting agents of the ARF1 function, resulted in similar effects on cell proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis. Interestingly, each combined treatment had distinct effects on ERK1/2 and AKT signaling, as indicated by the decreased levels of either phospho-ERK1/2 or phospho-AKT. Our results suggest that disruption of Golgi function could be used as a strategy for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195401</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4838f225</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charlotte Luchsinger, Marcelo Aguilar, Patricia V.

The Florida manatee (&lt;i&gt;Trichechus manatus latirotris&lt;/i&gt;) is a threatened aquatic mammal in United States coastal waters. Over the past decade, the appearance of papillomavirus-induced lesions and viral papillomatosis in manatees has been a concern for those involved in the management and rehabilitation of this species. To date, three manatee papillomaviruses (TmPVs) have been identified in Florida manatees, one forming cutaneous lesions (TmPV1) and two forming genital lesions (TmPV3 and TmPV4). We identified DNA sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplex structures (G4) across the three genomes. G4 were located on both DNA strands and across coding and non-coding regions on all TmPVs, offering multiple targets for viral control. Although G4 have been identified in several viral genomes, including human PVs, most research has focused on canonical structures comprised of three G-tetrads. In contrast, the vast majority of sequences we identified would allow the formation of non-canonical structures with only two G-tetrads. Our biophysical analysis confirmed the formation of G4 with parallel topology in three such sequences from the E2 region. Two of the structures appear comprised of multiple stacked two G-tetrad structures, perhaps serving to increase structural stability. Computational analysis demonstrated enrichment of G4 sequences on all TmPVs on the reverse strand in the E2/E4 region and on both strands in the L2 region. Several G4 sequences occurred at similar regional locations on all PVs, most notably on the reverse strand in the E2 region. In other cases, G4 were identified at similar regional locations only on PVs forming genital lesions. On all TmPVs, G4 sequences were located in the non-coding region near putative E2 binding sites. Together, these findings suggest that G4 are possible regulatory elements in TmPVs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195625</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e617e4f8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Zahin, William L.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an approved therapy for treatment of epilepsy and depression. While also shown to be promising in several preclinical and clinical studies to treat cardiovascular diseases, optimal therapeutic stimulation paradigms are still under investigation. Traditionally, parameters such as frequency, current, and duty cycle are used to adjust the efficacy of VNS therapy. This study explored the effect of novel stochastic VNS (S-VNS) on acute heart rate (HR) dynamics. The effect of S-VNS was evaluated in Sprague Dawley rats by comparing the acute HR and HR variability (HRV) responses to standard, periodic VNS (P-VNS) across different frequencies (FREQs, 10–30 Hz). Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>639419c9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Steven W.

Our results demonstrate that both S-VNS and P-VNS produced negative chronotropic effects in a FREQ-dependent manner with S-VNS inducing a significantly smaller drop in HR at 10 Hz and 20 Hz compared to P-VNS (p&amp;lt;0.05). S-VNS demonstrated a FREQ-dependent drop in the SD1/SD2 ratio, a measure of HRV, which was absent in P-VNS, suggesting that S-VNS may acutely modulate the nonlinear relationship between short- and long-term HRV. In conclusion, S-VNS is a novel stimulation procedure that may provide different physiological outcomes from standard P-VNS, as indicated by our analysis of HR dynamics. Our study provides a rationale for further detailed investigations into the therapeutic potential of S-VNS as a novel neuromodulation technique.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194910</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Steven W.

Current rates of species loss triggered numerous attempts to protect and conserve biodiversity. Species conservation, however, requires species identification skills, a competence obtained through intensive training and experience. Field researchers, land managers, educators, civil servants, and the interested public would greatly benefit from accessible, up-to-date tools automating the process of species identification. Currently, relevant technologies, such as digital cameras, mobile devices, and remote access to databases, are ubiquitously available, accompanied by significant advances in image processing and pattern recognition. The idea of automated species identification is approaching reality. We review the technical status quo on computer vision approaches for plant species identification, highlight the main research challenges to overcome in providing applicable tools, and conclude with a discussion of open and future research thrusts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bfmDpVYKmqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jana Wäldchen, Michael Rzanny, Marco Seeland, Patrick Mäder&lt;/p&gt;

Large-scale insertional mutagenesis screens can be powerful genome-wide tools if they are streamlined with efficient downstream analysis, which is a serious bottleneck in complex biological systems. A major impediment to the success of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based screens for virulence factors is that the genetic material of pathogens is often underrepresented within the eukaryotic host, making detection extremely challenging. We therefore established insertion Pool-Sequencing (iPool-Seq) on maize infected with the biotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maydis&lt;/i&gt;. iPool-Seq features tagmentation, unique molecular barcodes, and affinity purification of pathogen insertion mutant DNA from in vivo-infected tissues. In a proof of concept using iPool-Seq, we identified 28 virulence factors, including 23 that were previously uncharacterized, from an initial pool of 195 candidate effector mutants. Because of its sensitivity and quantitative nature, iPool-Seq can be applied to any insertional mutagenesis library and is especially suitable for genetically complex setups like pooled infections of eukaryotic hosts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/I200kmApCCw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Uhse, Florian G.

To gain more in-depth knowledge of how the act of caring and the adaption process affects caregiving spouses.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Phenomenological, qualitative study. This study included spouses of stroke survivors who also served as primary caregivers. Individual, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analysed using a thematic content analysis as proposed by Giorgi. Data was analysed and managed using Atlas-ti (version 7.0). This study was approved by our institution´s Complejo Hospitalario de Caceres Ethics and Research Committee.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Spouse caregivers of stroke survivors undergo a process of disruption in their private lives and relationships, marked by their caregiving duties. The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care.

Larvae of parasitoid wasps develop on a single arthropod host, and often face resource limitation that induces a tradeoff between egg maturation and somatic growth. Part of the variation in the growth-reproduction allocation was shown to be heritable, but how the larval developmental environment affects this allocation is not well-known. Detection of life history tradeoffs is often facilitated under stress conditions. We therefore exposed developing female larvae of the polyembryonic parasitoid &lt;i&gt;Copidosoma koehleri&lt;/i&gt; (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) to laboratory manipulations aimed to restrict host resources (either host-starvation or high larval density). We compared the females’ body sizes and egg loads shortly after adult emergence (&amp;lt;24 h) to those of closely related control females, which developed at a lower larval density within non-starved hosts. Host-starvation reduced the females’ body sizes but not their initial egg loads. Females that experienced high larval density produced more eggs but were similar in body size to the low-density controls. Thus, the relative allocation to reproduction increased in response to both manipulations of host condition. Developmental duration and longevity were similar in all treatments. The negative correlation between body size and reproductive allocation, observed in the host-starvation treatment, is compatible with previous evidence from other parasitoids. In the high larval density treatment, however, reproductive allocation increased while body size was maintained, suggesting that the higher density increased rather than limited host resources per developing parasitoid female. The additional host resources that were diverted into egg production possibly resulted from increased feeding and body mass gain by hosts parasitized by large broods of wasps. Our results demonstrate phenotypic plasticity in resource allocation between growth and reproduction in a developing parasitoid. This plasticity may contribute to an adaptive balance between longevity and mobility vs. fecundity during the adult stage.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195767</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>90de0f99</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yael Keinan, Rachel Braun, Tamar Keasar&lt;/p&gt;

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Timothy Kinyanjui, Jo Middleton, Stefan Güttel, Jackie Cassell, Joshua Ross, Thomas House&lt;/p&gt;

Bloodstream infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality with rates varying from 10–25% and higher. Appropriate and timely onset of antibiotic therapy influences the prognosis of these patients. It requires the diagnostic accuracy which is not afforded by current gold standards such as blood culture. Moreover, the time from blood sampling to blood culture results is a key determinant of reducing mortality. No established biomarkers exist which can differentiate bloodstream infections from other systemic inflammatory conditions. This calls for studies on biomarkers potential of molecular profiling of plasma as it is affected most by the molecular changes accompanying bloodstream infections. N-glycosylation is a post-translational modification which is very sensitive to changes in physiology. Here we have performed targeted quantitative N-glycoproteomics from plasma samples of patients with confirmed positive blood culture together with age and sex matched febrile controls with negative blood culture reports. Three hundred and sixty eight potential N-glycopeptides were quantified by mass spectrometry and 149 were further selected for identification. Twenty four N-glycopeptides were identified with high confidence together with elucidation of the peptide sequence, N-glycosylation site, glycan composition and proposed glycan structures. Principal component analysis, orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (S-Plot) and self-organizing maps clustering among other statistical methods were employed to analyze the data. These methods gave us clear separation of the two patient classes. We propose high-confidence N-glycopeptides which have the power to separate the bloodstream infections from blood culture negative febrile patients and shed light on host response during bacteremia.

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195282</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bb03bce4</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andréia Gonçalves Arruda, Carles Vilalta, Pere Puig, Andres Perez, Anna Alba&lt;/p&gt;

The centrifuge is among the oldest and most widely used pieces of laboratory equipment, with significant applications that include clinical diagnostics and biomedical research. A major limitation of laboratory centrifuges is their “black box” nature, limiting sample observation to before and after centrifugation. Thus, optimized protocols require significant trial and error, while unoptimized protocols waste time by centrifuging longer than necessary or material due to incomplete sedimentation. Here, we developed an instrumented centrifuge tube receptacle compatible with several commercial benchtop centrifuges that can provide real-time sample analysis during centrifugation. We demonstrated the system by monitoring cell separations during centrifugation for different spin speeds, concentrations, buffers, cell types, and temperatures. We show that the collected data are valuable for analytical purposes (e.g. quality control), or as feedback to the user or the instrument. For the latter, we verified an adaptation where complete sedimentation turned off the centrifuge and notified the user by a text message. Our system adds new functionality to existing laboratory centrifuges, saving users time and providing useful feedback. This add-on potentially enables new analytical applications for an instrument that has remained largely unchanged for decades.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195907</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fddcce0b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tony Hoang, Nicholas Moskwa, Ken Halvorsen&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the association between perceived social support and induced abortion among young women in Lima, Peru. In addition, prevalence and incidence of induced abortion was estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;A cross-sectional study enrolling women aged 18–25 years from maternal health centers in Southern Lima, Peru, was conducted. Induced abortion was defined as the difference between the total number of pregnancies ended in abortion and the number of spontaneous abortions; whereas perceived social support was assessed using the DUKE-UNC scale. Prevalence and incidence of induced abortion (per 100 person-years risk) was estimated, and the association of interest was evaluated using Poisson regression models with robust variance. A total of 298 women were enrolled, mean age 21.7 (± 2.2) years. Low levels of social support were found in 43.6% (95%CI 38.0%–49.3%), and 17.4% (95%CI: 13.1%– 21.8%) women reported at least one induced abortion. The incidence of induced abortion was 2.37 (95%CI: 1.81–3.11) per 100 person-years risk. The multivariable model showed evidence of the association between low perceived social support and induced abortion (RR = 1.94; 95%CI: 1.14–3.30) after controlling for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was evidence of an association between low perceived social support and induced abortion among women aged 18 to 25 years. Incidence of induced abortion was similar or even greater than rates of countries where abortion is legal. Strategies to increase social support and reduce induced abortion rates are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192764</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Luis E.

Use of virtual reality (VR) technology is often accompanied by a series of unwanted symptoms, including nausea and headache, which are characterised as ‘simulator sickness’. Sensory mismatch has been thought to lie at the heart of the problem and recent studies have shown that reducing cue mismatch in VR can have a therapeutic effect. Specifically, electrical stimulation of vestibular afferent nerves (galvanic vestibular stimulation; GVS) can reduce simulator sickness in VR. However, GVS poses a risk to certain populations and can also result in negative symptoms in normal, healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether noisy vestibular stimulation through bone-vibration can also reduce symptoms of simulator sickness. We carried out two experiments in which participants performed a spatial navigation task in VR and completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire over a series of trials. Experiment 1 was conducted using a high-end projection-based VR display, whereas Experiment 2 involved the use of a consumer head mounted display. During each trial, vestibular stimulation was either: 1) absent; 2) coupled with large angular accelerations of the projection camera; or 3) applied randomly throughout each trial. In half of the trials, participants actively navigated using a motion controller, and in the other half they were moved passively through the environment along pre-recorded motion trajectories. In both experiments we obtained lower simulator sickness scores when vestibular stimulation was coupled with angular accelerations of the camera. This effect was obtained for both active and passive movement control conditions, which did not differ. The results suggest that noisy vestibular stimulation can reduce simulator sickness, and that this effect appears to generalize across VR conditions. We propose further examination of this stimulation technique.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194137</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b6d54c28</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Séamas Weech, Jae Moon, Nikolaus F.

In pluripotent stem cells, rapidly-evolving KRAB-ZNF genes target TEs for silencing by H3K9me3. To investigate the evolution of TE silencing, we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We identified four million orthologous TEs and found the SVA and ERV families to be marked most frequently by H3K9me3.

In pluripotent stem cells, rapidly-evolving KRAB-ZNF genes target TEs for silencing by H3K9me3. To investigate the evolution of TE silencing, we performed H3K9me3 ChIP-seq experiments in induced pluripotent stem cells from ten human and seven chimpanzee individuals. We identified four million orthologous TEs and found the SVA and ERV families to be marked most frequently by H3K9me3. We found little evidence of inter-species differences in TE silencing, with as many as 82% of putatively silenced TEs marked at similar levels in humans and chimpanzees. TEs that are preferentially silenced in one species are a similar age to those silenced in both species, and are not more likely to be associated with expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes.

Tenofovir (TFV), a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor, requires two phosphorylation steps to form a competitive inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase. Adenylate kinase 2 (&lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;) has been previously demonstrated to phosphorylate tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate, while creatine kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;), pyruvate kinase, muscle (&lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;) and pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cell (&lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt;) each have been found to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to the pharmacologically active tenofovir-diphosphate. In the present study, genomic DNA isolated from dried blood spots collected from 505 participants from Bangkok, Thailand; Cape Town, South Africa; and New York City, USA were examined for variants in &lt;i&gt;AK2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CKM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PKM&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PKLR&lt;/i&gt; using next-generation sequencing. The bioinformatics tools SIFT and PolyPhen predicted that 19 of the 505 individuals (3.7% frequency) carried variants in at least one kinase that would result in a decrease or loss of enzymatic activity. To functionally test these predictions, AK2 and AK2 variants were expressed in and purified from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, followed by investigation of their activities towards tenofovir. Interestingly, we found that purified AK2 had the ability to phosphorylate tenofovir-monophosphate to tenofovir-diphosphate in addition to phosphorylating tenofovir to tenofovir-monophosphate. Further, four of the six AK2 variants predicted to result in a loss or decrease of enzyme function exhibited a ≥30% decrease in activity towards tenofovir in our in vitro assays. Of note, an AK2 K28R variant resulted in a 72% and 81% decrease in the formation of tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate, respectively. These data suggest that there are naturally occurring genetic variants that could potentially impact TFV activation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195764</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9a832a89</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dominique B.

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006). Abdominal visceral temperatures also increased with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; insufflation compared with ambient air or CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown by infrared thermography.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in the Wistar rat the efficacy of various autologous nerve conduits with various forms of blood supply in reconstructing a 10-mm-long gap in the median nerve (MN) under conditions of local ischemia. A 10-mm-long median nerve defect was created in the right arm. A loose silicone tube was placed around the nerve gap zone, in order to simulate a local ischemic environment. Rats were divided in the following experimental groups (each with 20 rats): the nerve Graft (NG) group, in which the excised MN segment was reattached; the conventional nerve flap (CNF) and the arterialized neurovenous flap (ANVF) groups in which the gap was bridged with homonymous median nerve flaps; the prefabricated nerve flap (PNF) group in which the gap was reconstructed with a fabricated flap created by leaving an arteriovenous fistula in contact with the sciatic nerve for 5 weeks; and the two control groups, Sham and Excision groups. In the latter group, the proximal stump of the MN nerve was ligated and no repair was performed. The rats were followed for 100 days. During this time, they did physiotherapy. Functional, electroneuromyographic and histological studies were performed. The CNF and ANVF groups presented better results than the NG group in the following assessments: grasping test, nociception, motor stimulation threshold, muscle weight, and histomorphometric evaluation. Radial deviation of the operated forepaw was more common in rats that presented worse results in the other outcome variables. Overall, CNFs and ANVFs produced a faster and more complete recovery than NGs in the reconstruction of a 10-mm-long median nerve gap in an ischemic environment in the Wistar rat. Although, results obtained with CNFs were in most cases were better than ANVFs, these differences were not statistically significant for most of the outcome variables.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>17b4cadf</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diogo Casal, Eduarda Mota-Silva, Inês Iria, Sara Alves, Ana Farinho, Cláudia Pen, Nuno Lourenço-Silva, Luís Mascarenhas-Lemos, José Silva-Ferreira, Mário Ferraz-Oliveira, Valentina Vassilenko, Paula Alexandra Videira, João Goyri-O’Neill, Diogo Pais&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Background &lt;p&gt;Linkage to and retention in care for US persons living with HIV (PLWH) after release from jail usually declines. We know of no rigorously evaluated behavioral interventions that can improve this. We hypothesized that a strengths-based case management intervention that we developed for PLWH leaving jail would increase linkage/retention in care (indicated by receipt of laboratory draws) and a suppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the year following release.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We conducted a quasi-experimental feasibility study of our intervention for PLWH jailed in Atlanta. We recruited 113 PLWH in jail starting in 2014. “SUCCESS” (Sustained, Unbroken Connection to Care, Entry Services, and Suppression) began in jail and continued post-release. Subjects who started the intervention but subsequently began long-term incarcerations were excluded from further analysis. Persons who were retained in the intervention group were compared to contemporaneously incarcerated PLWH who did not receive the intervention. Identities were submitted to an enhanced HIV/AIDS reporting system (eHARS) at the state health department to capture all laboratories drawn. Both community engagement and care upon jail return were assessed equally. For 44 intervention participants released to Atlanta, 50% of care occurred on subsequent jail stays, as documented with EventFlow software. Forty-five receiving usual services only were recruited for comparison. By examining records of jail reentries, half of participants and 60% of controls recidivated (range: 1–8 returns). All but 6 participants in the intervention and 9 subjects in the comparison arm had ≥1 laboratory recorded in eHARS post-release. Among the intervention group, 52% were retained in care (i.e., had two laboratory studies, &gt; = 3 months apart), versus 40% among the comparison group (OR = 1.60, 95% CI (0.71, 3.81)). Both arms showed improved viral load suppression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a trend towards increased retention for PLWH released from jail after SUCCESS, compared to usual services.

Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (&lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&lt;/i&gt;) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2c9bb0c1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Adamovicz, Matthew C.

Investigation of human diet during the Neolithic has often been limited to a few archaeological cultures or single sites. In order to provide insight into the development of human food consumption and husbandry strategies, our study explores bone collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 466 human and 105 faunal individuals from 26 sites in central Germany. It is the most extensive data set to date from an enclosed geographic microregion, covering 4,000 years of agricultural history from the Early Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age. The animal data show that a variety of pastures and dietary resources were explored, but that these changed remarkably little over time. In the human &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N however we found a significant increase with time across the different archaeological cultures. This trend could be observed in all time periods and archaeological cultures (Bell Beaker phenomenon excluded), even on continuously populated sites. Since there was no such trend in faunal isotope values, we were able largely to exclude manuring as the cause of this effect. Based on the rich interdisciplinary data from this region and archaeological period we can argue that meat consumption increased with the increasing duration of farming subsistence.
In &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, we could not observe any clear increasing or decreasing trends during the archaeological time periods, either for humans or for animals, which would have suggested significant changes in the environment and landscape use. We discovered sex-related dietary differences, with males of all archaeological periods having higher &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N values than females, and an age-related increasing consumption of animal protein. An initial decrease of &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-values at the age of 1–2 years reveals partial weaning, while complete weaning took place at the age of 3–4 years.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3910428</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Angelina Münster, Corina Knipper, Vicky M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups.

&lt;i&gt;Cerasus humilis&lt;/i&gt; is endemic to China and is a new fruit tree species with economic and environmental benefits, with potential developmental and utilization applications. We report the first complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;. Its genome is 158,084 bp in size, and the overall GC content is 36.8%. An inverted repeats (IR) of 52,672 bp in size is separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,374 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 19,038 bp. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; contains 131 genes including 90 protein-coding genes, 33 transfer RNA genes, and 8 ribosomal RNA genes. The genome has a total 510 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Of these, 306, 149, and 55 were found in the LSC, IR, and SSC regions, respectively. In addition, a comparison of the boundaries of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions of ten other &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species exhibited an overall high degree of sequence similarity, with slight variations in the IR boundary region which included gene deletions, insertions, expansions, and contractions. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; lost the &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRA/SSC border and it has the largest &lt;i&gt;ycf1&lt;/i&gt; gene at the IRB/SSC border among these &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; species, whereas the &lt;i&gt;rps19&lt;/i&gt; gene was inserted at the IRB/LSC junction. Furthermore, phylogenetic reconstruction using 61 conserved coding-protein genes clustered &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;Prunus tomentosa&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the complete chloroplast genome sequence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt; provides a rich source of genetic information for studies on &lt;i&gt;Prunus&lt;/i&gt; taxonomy, phylogeny, and evolution, as well as lays the foundation for further development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;humilis&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196473</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3962f85c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaopeng Mu, Pengfei Wang, Junjie Du, Yu Gary Gao, Jiancheng Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

One of the more fundamental health policy questions is the relationship between health care quality and spending. A better understanding of these relationships is needed to inform health systems interventions aimed at increasing quality and efficiency of care. We measured 65 validated quality indicators (QI) across Ontario physician networks. QIs were aggregated into domains representing six dimensions of care: screening and prevention, evidence-based medications, hospital-community transitions (7-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician; 30-day post-discharge visit with a primary care physician and specialist), potentially avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, potentially avoidable readmissions and unplanned returns to the ED, and poor cancer end of life care. Each domain rate was computed as a weighted average of QI rates, weighting by network population at risk. We also measured overall and sector-specific per capita healthcare network spending. We evaluated the associations between domain rates, and between domain rates and spending using weighted correlations, weighting by network population at risk, using an ecological design. All indicators were measured using Ontario health administrative databases. Large variations were seen in timely hospital-community transitions and potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Networks with timely hospital-community transitions had lower rates of avoidable admissions and readmissions (r = -0.89, -0.58, respectively). Higher physician spending, especially outpatient primary care spending, was associated with lower rates of avoidable hospitalizations (r = -0.83) and higher rates of timely hospital-community transitions (r = 0.81) and moderately associated with lower readmission rates (r = -0.46). Investment in effective primary care services may help reduce burden on the acute care sector and associated expenditures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195222</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>13e993e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Farah Rahman, Jun Guan, Richard H.

The use of antimicrobial monomers, linked to the polymer chain of resin composites, is an interesting approach to circumvent the effects of bacteria on the dental and material surfaces. In addition, it can likely reduce the incidence of recurrent caries lesions.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is a superfamily found in all eukaryotes that plays important roles in regulating growth and development. Over the past several decades, many &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; superfamily genes have been identified and characterized in herbaceous and woody plants. However, the genes belonging to the bHLH superfamily in peach (&lt;i&gt;Prunus persica&lt;/i&gt;) have not yet been comprehensively identified and characterized. Here, we identified 95 members of the bHLH superfamily in the peach genome, and these genes were classified into 19 subfamilies based on a phylogenetic comparison with bHLH proteins from &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. The members within each subfamily were highly conserved according to the analysis of motif compositions and exon/intron organizations. The 95 &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were unevenly distributed on chromosomes 1 to 8 of the peach genome. We identified 57 pairs of bHLH members that were orthologous between peach and &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;. Additionally, 48 pairs of paralogous &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes were identified on the eight chromosomes of the peach genome. Coupled with relative expression analysis of &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes in red-fleshed peach fruit at five developmental stages, we identified several &lt;i&gt;bHLH&lt;/i&gt; genes that might be involved in fruit development and anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms through which these genes are involved in the regulation of biological and biochemical processes in peach and lays the foundation for further studies on these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195974</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5fa2e0ac</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chunhua Zhang, Ruchao Feng, Ruijuan Ma, Zhijun Shen, Zhixiang Cai, Zhizhong Song, Bin Peng, Mingliang Yu&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality. Resolving these issues may improve the clinical performance of the STAN device.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195978</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>be801b98</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Andriessen, Alex Zwanenburg, Judith O.

Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation.

Adverse event (AE)-related costs represent an important component of economic models for cancer care. However, since previous studies mostly focused on specific AEs, treatments, or cancer types, limited information is currently available. Therefore, this study assessed the incremental healthcare costs associated with a large number of AEs among patients diagnosed with some of the most prevalent types of cancer. Data were obtained from a large US claims database. Adult patients were included if diagnosed with and treated for one of the following cancer types: breast, digestive organs and peritoneum, genitourinary organs (including bladder and ovary and other uterine adnexa), lung, lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, and skin. Treatment episodes were defined as the period from initiation of the first antineoplastic pharmacologic therapy to discontinuation (i.e., gap of ≥ 45 days), or change in treatment regimen, or end of data availability. A total of 36 AEs were selected from the product inserts of 104 treatments recommended by practice guidelines. A retrospective matched cohort design was used, matching a treatment episode with a certain AE with a treatment episode without that AE. A total of 412,005 patients were selected, for a total of 794,243 treatment episodes, resulting in 1,617,368 matched treatment episodes across all 36 AEs. Incremental healthcare costs associated with AEs of any severity ranged from $546 for cough/upper respiratory infections to $24,633 for gastrointestinal perforation. The three most costly AEs when considering any severity were gastrointestinal perforation ($24,633), central nervous system hemorrhage ($24,322), and sepsis/septicemia ($23,510). Incremental healthcare costs associated with severe AEs ranged from $15,709 for dermatitis and rash to $48,538 for gastrointestinal fistula. The three most costly severe AEs were gastrointestinal fistula ($48,538), gastrointestinal perforation ($41,281), and central nervous system hemorrhage ($38,428). In conclusion, AEs during treatment episodes for cancer were frequent and associated with a substantial economic burden.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>William Wong</name></author><title>Assessment of costs associated with adverse events in patients with cancer</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523653200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:179363f:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196007</link><published>1523653200000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23800-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/246_EITDLCs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23800-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/246_EITDLCs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522315288233</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3d152804</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/246_EITDLCs/s41598-018-23800-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yi-Lun Lee</name></author><title>Epigallocatechin-3-gallate alleviates bladder overactivity in a rat model with metabolic syndrome and ovarian hormone deficiency through mitochondria apoptosis pathways</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162710fdea9:7193cb0:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23800-w</link><published>1522306800000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

In the present study, we examined the effects of different drying conditions on the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages. We approached this objective by comparing invertebrate assemblages in perennial and intermittent sites along two intermittent Mediterranean streams with contrasting predictability, duration, and spatial patterns of drying: Fuirosos (high predictability, short duration, downstream drying pattern) and Rogativa (low predictability, long duration, patchy drying pattern). Specifically, we quantified the contribution of individual taxa to those differences, the degree of nestedness, and shifts in the composition, structure and function of benthic invertebrate assemblages along flow intermittence gradients. We observed greater effects of drying on the benthic invertebrate composition in Fuirosos than in Rogativa, resulting in a higher dissimilarity of assemblages between perennial and intermittent sites, as well as a lower degree of nestedness. Furthermore, a higher number of biotic metrics related to richness, abundance and biological traits were significantly different between perennial and intermittent sites in Fuirosos, despite a shorter dry period compared to Rogativa. At the same time, slightly different responses were detected during post-drying (autumn) than pre-drying (spring) conditions in this stream. In Rogativa, shifts in benthic invertebrate assemblages along increasing gradients of flow intermittence were found for three metrics (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and Odonata, Coleoptera and Heteroptera (OCH) abundances and aerial active dispersal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combined gradients of dry period duration and distance to nearest perennial reach can generate complex, and different, responses of benthic invertebrate assemblages, depending on the flow intermittence metric. Our study advances the notion that special attention should be paid to the predictability, duration and spatial patterns of drying in intermittent streams in order to disentangle the effects of drying on benthic invertebrate assemblages, in particular in areas subject to high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in drying conditions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193933</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2ad5a22a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by María Mar Sánchez-Montoya, Daniel von Schiller, Gonzalo G.

d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>afe65d58</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tien-Kieu Nguyen, Moon-Gi Hong, Pahn-Shick Chang, Byung-Hoo Lee, Sang-Ho Yoo&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;While silent brain infarcts (SBIs) in screened cohorts are associated with risk of symptomatic stroke and dementia, the clinical significance of incidentally discovered SBIs (id-SBIs) is unknown. Detection may offer an opportunity to initiate prevention measures, but uncertainties about id-SBIs may impede clinicians from addressing them and complicate further study of this condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;This study used semi-structured interviews of practicing clinicians. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. A constant comparative method was used to organize emergent themes and examine new themes. Purposeful sampling was employed to achieve participant diversity. Fifteen clinicians were interviewed. Emergent themes centered on uncertainty about id-SBIs, clinical decision making in response to uncertainty, and evidence needed to resolve uncertainty. All clinicians reported uncertainty about id-SBIs: diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic. Differential responses to uncertainties resulted in practice variation within and between specialties. Diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty discouraged disclosure of imaging findings to patients. Vascular neurologists viewed the prognostic significance of id-SBIs as similar to symptomatic stroke. Therapeutic uncertainty was common, but most participants endorsed using stroke secondary prevention strategies. Regarding future research, all internists indicated they would consider changing practices in response to observational studies, whereas half of the neurologists expressed reluctance to modify practices based on non-randomized data. Several expressed concerns about clinical trial feasibility and lack of equipoise.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;id-SBIs are a focus of uncertainty for clinicians, leading to practice variation.

Abstract &lt;p&gt;Meta-research is research about research. Meta-research may not be as click-worthy as a meta-pug—a pug dog dressed up in a pug costume—but it is crucial to understanding research. A particularly valuable contribution of meta-research is to identify biases in a body of evidence. Bias can occur in the design, conduct, or publication of research and is a systematic deviation from the truth in results or inferences. The findings of meta-research can tell us which evidence to trust and what must be done to improve future research. We should be using meta-research to provide the evidence base for implementing systemic changes to improve research, not for discrediting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dx20SHTzNfY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa Bero&lt;/p&gt;

As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%.

As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11–12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lusha Wei</name></author><title>Optimization of alkaline extraction of hemicellulose from sweet sorghum bagasse and its direct application for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides by &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; strain MR44</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523394000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b7:9aea0a7d</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195616</link><published>1523394000000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0133-1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0133-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0133-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524668826214</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Neuroscience</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><fingerprint>def97051</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0133-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0133-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0133-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Kimberly L Stachenfeld</name></author><title>Author Correction: The hippocampus as a predictive map</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_162fd580266:4c945c:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0133-1</link><published>1524639600000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00288</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00288/20180326/images/medium/jp-2018-00288w_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00288&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195048</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d1d1d7b7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samantha J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

Mean HGS of the dominant hand in men and women was 39.5 and 24.2 kg, respectively. The peak in HGS was at 35–39 years of age, after which HGS decreased in both sexes. HGS was significantly correlated with height, weight, and BMI. The cut-off values for weak HGS were &amp;lt; 28.9 and &amp;lt; 16.8 kg in men and women, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results provide useful reference values to assess HGS in patients who undergo hand surgery or who have various diseases that affect HGS.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To establish reference values for hand grip strength (HGS) in a healthy Korean population and to identify the dependent anthropometric variables that affect HGS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Based on the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2014 to 2015, we analyzed the HGS data of 7,969 South Koreans. Individuals with specific chronic diseases and who reported poor subjective health status were excluded to ensure a healthy population sample. Means with standard deviations (SDs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each 5-year interval starting from 10 years of age. To determine the relationship between HGS and anthropometric variables, we performed correlation analyses between HGS and height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Improving maternal health outcomes remains a priority in Low and Middle Income Countries. With the rapid proliferation of mobile health technologies, there is an increased interest in understanding how these technologies can effectively improve maternal health outcomes particularly maternal health seeking knowledge and behaviors.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection.

Patient-nominated supporters can potentially improve the continuum of HIV care. We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011–2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83–7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195389</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9c6e7c3d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>55727e5b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

The cause of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer has long been debated, with many ascribing these relapses to the natural progression of the disease. Others have proposed that some aspect of surgical tumor resection triggers the outgrowth of otherwise-dormant metastases, leading to the synchronous pattern of relapse. Clinical data cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, and previous experimental approaches have not provided clear answers. Such uncertainty hinders the development and application of therapeutic approaches that could potentially reduce early metastatic relapse.

The cause of early metastatic relapse in breast cancer has long been debated, with many ascribing these relapses to the natural progression of the disease. Others have proposed that some aspect of surgical tumor resection triggers the outgrowth of otherwise-dormant metastases, leading to the synchronous pattern of relapse. Clinical data cannot distinguish between these hypotheses, and previous experimental approaches have not provided clear answers. Such uncertainty hinders the development and application of therapeutic approaches that could potentially reduce early metastatic relapse. We describe an experimental model system that definitively links surgery and the subsequent wound-healing response to the outgrowth of tumor cells at distant anatomical sites. Specifically, we find that the systemic inflammatory response induced after surgery promotes the emergence of tumors whose growth was otherwise restricted by a tumor-specific T cell response.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;As atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic, it may remain undiagnosed until or even after development of complications, such as stroke. Consequently the observed prevalence of AF may underestimate total disease burden.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the United States, we performed a retrospective cohort modeling study in working age (18–64) and elderly (≥65) people using commercial and Medicare administrative claims databases. We identified patients in years 2004–2010 with incident AF following an ischemic stroke. Using a back-calculation methodology, we estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed AF as the ratio of the number of post-stroke AF patients and the CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-specific stroke probability for each patient, adjusting for age and gender composition based on United States census data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The estimated prevalence of AF (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was 3,873,900 (95%CI: 3,675,200–4,702,600) elderly and 1,457,100 (95%CI: 1,218,500–1,695,800) working age adults, representing 10.0% and 0.92% of the respective populations. Of these, 698,900 were undiagnosed: 535,400 (95%CI: 331,900–804,400) elderly and 163,500 (95%CI: 17,700–400,000) working age adults, representing 1.3% and 0.09% of the respective populations. Among all undiagnosed cases, 77% had a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥1, and 56% had CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Using a back-calculation approach, we estimate that the total AF prevalence in 2009 was 5.3 million of which 0.7 million (13.1% of AF cases) were undiagnosed.

The CHARMM family of force fields were developed for use with the TIP3P water model. This water model has an anomalously high dielectric constant and low viscosity, which limits its accuracy in the calculation of quantities like permeability coefficients. The TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB water models are more accurate in terms of the dielectric constant and transport properties, which could allow more accurate simulations of systems containing water and lipids.

The CHARMM family of force fields were developed for use with the TIP3P water model. This water model has an anomalously high dielectric constant and low viscosity, which limits its accuracy in the calculation of quantities like permeability coefficients. The TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB water models are more accurate in terms of the dielectric constant and transport properties, which could allow more accurate simulations of systems containing water and lipids. To test whether the CHARMM36 lipid force field is compatible with the TIP3P-FB and TIP4P-FB water models, we have performed simulations of DPPC and POPC bilayers.

to fuels is required to enable the production of sustainable fuels and to
contribute to alleviating CO2 emissions. In considering conversion
of CO2, the initial step of adsorption and activation by the catalyst
is crucial. In addressing this difficult problem, we have examined how
nanoclusters of reducible metal oxides supported on TiO2 can promote
CO2 activation. In this paper we present density functional theory
(DFT) simulations of CO2 activation on heterostructures composed of extended
rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces modified with chromia nanoclusters.
The heterostructures show non-bulk Cr and O sites in the nanoclusters and an
upshifted valence band edge that is dominated by Cr 3d- O 2p interactions. We
show that the supported chromia nanoclusters can adsorb and activate CO2 and
that activation of CO2 is promoted whether the TiO2
support is oxidised or hydroxylated. Reduced heterostructures, formed by
removal of oxygen from the chromia nanocluster, also promote CO2
activation. In the strong CO2 adsorption modes, the molecule bends
giving O-C-O angles of 127 - 132o and elongation of C-O distances up
to 1.30 Å; no carbonates are formed. The electronic properties show a strong CO2-Cr-O
interaction that drives the interaction of CO2 with the nanocluster
and induces the structural distortions. These results highlight that a metal
oxide support modified with reducible metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2,
thus helping to overcome difficulties associated with the difficult first step
in CO2 conversion.</description><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Activation_of_CO2_at_Chromia-Nanocluster-Modified_Rutile_and_Anatase_TiO2/6025658</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><title>Activation of CO2 at Chromia-Nanocluster-Modified Rutile and Anatase TiO2</title><unread>True</unread><published>1522022400000</published><engagement>4</engagement><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_16262fca69e:5bafa10:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Activation_of_CO2_at_Chromia-Nanocluster-Modified_Rutile_and_Anatase_TiO2/6025658</link><summary><content>Converting CO2

Cardiac 4D flow MRI was performed in healthy volunteers at 1.5T (n = 23). Reproducibility was investigated using MR scanners from two different vendors on the same day (n = 8). Subsets of volunteers were also imaged without respiratory gating (n = 17), at 3T on the same day (n = 6), and 1–12 days later on the same scanner (n = 9, median 6 days). Agreement was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Phantom validation showed good accuracy for both scanners (Scanner 1: bias -14±9%, y = 0.82x+0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.96, Scanner 2: bias -12±8%, y = 0.99x-0.08, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.00). Force reproducibility was strong in the LV (0.09±0.07 vs 0.09±0.07 N, bias 0.00±0.04 N, ICC = 0.87) and RV (0.09±0.06 vs 0.09±0.05 N, bias 0.00±0.03, ICC = 0.83). Strong to very strong agreement was found for scans with and without respiratory gating (LV/RV: ICC = 0.94/0.95), scans on different days (ICC = 0.92/0.87), and 1.5T and 3T scans (ICC = 0.93/0.94).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Software for quantification of hemodynamic forces in 4D-flow MRI was developed, and results show high accuracy and strong to very strong reproducibility for both the LV and RV, supporting its use for research and clinical investigations.

Force reproducibility was strong in the LV (0.09±0.07 vs 0.09±0.07 N, bias 0.00±0.04 N, ICC = 0.87) and RV (0.09±0.06 vs 0.09±0.05 N, bias 0.00±0.03, ICC = 0.83). Strong to very strong agreement was found for scans with and without respiratory gating (LV/RV: ICC = 0.94/0.95), scans on different days (ICC = 0.92/0.87), and 1.5T and 3T scans (ICC = 0.93/0.94).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Software for quantification of hemodynamic forces in 4D-flow MRI was developed, and results show high accuracy and strong to very strong reproducibility for both the LV and RV, supporting its use for research and clinical investigations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measuring viral DNA methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women showed promise for accurate detection of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer. Methylation status has been widely investigated for HPV16, sporadically for other HPV types.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Objective of this methodological study was to set up molecular methods to test the methylation levels in the twelve oncogenic HPV types by pyrosequencing, minimizing the number of HPV type-specific PCR protocols. Target CpGs were selected on the HPV L1 (two regions, L1 I and L1 II) and L2 genes.Study samples included DNA stored at Turin, Italy, purified by cervical cells collected in Standard Transport Medium or PreservCyt from women who participated in two studies (N = 126 and 140) nested within the regional organized screening programme.PCR consensus primers were designed by PyroMark Assay Design software to be suitable for amplification of many different oncogenic HPV types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Generation of consensus primers was successful for L1 I and II regions, unsuccessful for L2 region, for which HPV type-specific primers remained necessary. The difference between replicated tests on the same sample was ≤4% in 88%, 77% and 91% of cases when targeting the L1 I, L1 II and L2 regions, respectively. The corresponding intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.94, 0.87 and 0.97 respectively.

To navigate their surroundings, cells rely on sensory input that is corrupted by noise. In cells performing chemotaxis, such noise arises from the stochastic binding of signalling molecules at low chemoattractant concentrations. We reveal a fundamental relationship between the speed of chemotactic steering and the strength of directional fluctuations that result from the amplification of noise in a chemical input signal. This relation implies a trade-off between steering that is slow and reliable, and steering that is fast but less reliable. We show that dynamic switching between these two modes of steering can substantially increase the probability to find a target, such as an egg to be found by sperm cells. This decision making confers no advantage in the absence of noise, but is beneficial when chemical signals are detectable, yet characterized by low signal-to-noise ratios. The latter applies at intermediate distances from a target, where signalling molecules are diluted, thus defining a ‘noise zone’ that cells have to cross. Our results explain decision making observed in recent experiments on sea urchin sperm chemotaxis. More generally, our theory demonstrates how decision making enables chemotactic agents to cope with high levels of noise in gradient sensing by dynamically adjusting the persistence length of a biased random walk.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0k29V7Enzbw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justus A.

Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanket Rane, Thea Hogan, Benedict Seddon, Andrew J.

Barre Hellquist&lt;/p&gt;
Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;.

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation. This unique hybrid taxon, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;×floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, adds another case study to the debate on hybrid protection; consequences for its conservation are discussed.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195241</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Zdeněk Kaplan</name></author><title>The endangered Florida pondweed (&amp;lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) is a hybrid: Why we need to understand biodiversity thoroughly</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522702800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76930:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195241</link><published>1522702800000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03914-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOXA9 inhibits HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis through interacting with CRIP2 to repress cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOXA9 inhibits HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis through interacting with CRIP2 to repress cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma development, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03914-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03914-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1α promotes glycolysis allowing cell survival under stress.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;A prospective Drug Utilization Review (DUR) program has been implemented in Korea to improve the quality and safety of medication use.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the influence of the DUR program in reducing incidence of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was performed using administrative data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). The claims data for all adult patients with adverse drug events (ADE)-related diagnoses from 2009 to 2014 were obtained. Incidence rates of first-time and repeat pADRs prior to and after DUR program implementation were evaluated. Quarterly trends in incidence rates of overall ADE, allergic reactions, and ADRs were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data extraction covering the period from 2009 to 2014 led to the identification of 3,927,662 records. First-time pADR rates decreased gradually after implementation of the DUR program (change in slope: -0.016, p = 0.02). The program had a similar influence on repeat pADR rates (change in slope: -0.006, p≤0.01). The program did not decrease rates of first-time or repeat allergic reactions (change in slope: 0.018, p = 0.07 and 0.003, p = 0.04, respectively). In the cohort aged ≤65 years, first-time pADR rate reduction was significant (28.2% [27.1–29.3] in ≤18 years, and 19.8% [18.1–21.5] in 19–64 years). In contrast, first-time pADR rate was increased by 0.6% [-0.7–1.9] in patients ≥65 years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Implementation of the prospective DUR program effectively reduced the number of pADRs.

In the future, to reduce non-preventable ADRs such as allergic reactions, provision of clinical information including allergy history should be added to the DUR program.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195434</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jimin Lee</name></author><title>Evaluation of preventable adverse drug reactions by implementation of the nationwide network of prospective drug utilization review program in Korea</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1523480400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd8d:9f3b30f2</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195434</link><published>1523480400000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25156?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522120090699</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8b0ab16d</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25156?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><published>1522120090699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162656d644b:6ce12:76251cdd</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25156?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.29988</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/29988</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523959454270</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>92f92a56</fingerprint><description>Imaginal progenitors in Drosophila are known to arrest in G2 during larval stages and proliferate thereafter.

In this study, individuals estimated interval times of several minutes (from 2 to 32 minutes) during their everyday lives using a cell phone they kept with them. Their emotional state, the difficulty of the activity performed during this interval, and the attention that it required were also assessed, together with their subjective experience of the passage of time. The results showed that the mean time estimates and their variability increased linearly with increasing interval duration, indicating that the fundamental scalar property of time found for short durations also applies to very long durations of several minutes. In addition, the emotional state and difficulty of the activity were significant predictors of the judgment of long durations.

Background &lt;p&gt;This is the first report to characterize the prevalence and genovar distribution of genital chlamydial infections among random heterosexual patients in the multi-ethnic Saratov Region, located in Southeast Russia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixty-one clinical samples (cervical or urethral swabs) collected from a random cohort of 856 patients (7.1%) were &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) positive in commercial nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and duplex TaqMan PCRs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Sequence analysis of the VDII region of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene revealed seven genovars of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; in PCR-positive patients. The overall genovars were distributed as E (41.9%), G (21.6%), F (13.5%), K (9.5%), D (6.8%), J (4.1%), and H (2.7%). CT-positive samples were from males (n = 12, 19.7%), females (n = 42, 68.8%), and anonymous (n = 7, 11.5%) patients, with an age range of 19 to 45 years (average 26.4), including 12 different ethnic groups representative of this region. Most patients were infected with a single genovar (82%), while 18% were co-infected with either two or three genovars. The 1156 bp-fragment of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene was sequenced in 46 samples to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among isolates. SNP-based subtyping and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of 13 variants of the &lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt; gene, such as E (E1, E2, E6), G (G1, G2, G3, G5), F1, K, D (D1, Da2), J1, and H2. Differing genovar distribution was identified among urban (E&gt;G&gt;F) and rural (E&gt;K) populations, and in Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;D) and non-Slavic (E&gt;G&gt;K) ethnic groups. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined five sequences types (STs), such as ST4 (56%, 95% confidence interval, CI, 70.0 to 41.3), ST6 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3), ST9 (22%, 95% CI 35.9 to 11.5), ST10 (2%, 95% CI 10.7 to 0.05) and ST38 (10%, 95% CI 21.8 to 3.3). Thus, the most common STs were ST4 and ST9.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; is a significant cause of morbidity among random heterosexual patients with genital chlamydial infections in the Saratov Region.

Random fluctuations in the amount of cellular components like mRNA and protein molecules are inevitable due to the stochastic and discrete nature of biochemical reactions. If large enough, this so-called “cellular noise” can lead to random transitions between the expression states of a multistable genetic circuit. That way, heterogeneity within isogenic populations is created. Our aim is to understand which dynamical features of a simple autoregulatory system determine its intrinsic noise level, and how they can be modified in order to regulate state-transitions. To that end, novel mathematical methods for the state-dependent characterization and prediction of noise in multistable systems are developed. First, we introduce the hybrid LNA, a modified version of the Linear Noise Approximation. It yields good predictions on variances of mRNA and protein fluctuations, even for reaction systems comprising low-copy-number components (e.g. mRNA) and highly nonlinear reaction rates. Furthermore, the temporal structure of fluctuations and the skewness of the protein distribution are characterized via state-dependent protein burst sizes and burst frequencies. Based on this mathematical framework, we develop graphical methods which support the intuitive design of regulatory circuits with a desired noise pattern. The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2ebafd65</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Katharina Hortsch, Andreas Kremling&lt;/p&gt;

The methods are then used to predict how overall noise in the system can be adapted, and how state-specific noise modifications are possible that allow, e.g., the generation of unidirectional transitions. Our considerations are validated by stochastic simulations. This way, a design of genetic circuits is possible that takes population heterogeneity into account and is valuable in applications of synthetic biology and biotechnology. Moreover, natural phenomena like the bimodal development of genetic competence can be studied.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sayuri Katharina Hortsch</name></author><title>Characterization of noise in multistable genetic circuits reveals ways to modulate heterogeneity</title><unread>False</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f8:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194779</link><published>1522098000000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196219</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Plant leaves of different ages differ in nutrients and toxic metabolites and thus exhibit various resistance levels against insect herbivores. However, little is known about the influence of leaf ontogeny on plant resistance to phloem-feeding insects. In this study, we found that the green peach aphid, &lt;i&gt;Myzus persicae&lt;/i&gt;, preferred to settle on young cabbage leaves compared with mature or old leaves, although young leaves contained the highest concentration of glucosinolates. Furthermore, aphids feeding on young leaves had higher levels of glucosinolates in their body, but aphids performed better on young leaves in terms of body weight and population growth. Phloem sap of young leaves had higher amino acid:sugar molar ratio than mature leaves, and aphids feeding on young leaves showed two times longer phloem feeding time and five times more honeydew excretion than on other leaves. These results indicate that aphids acquired the highest amount of nutrients and defensive metabolites when feeding on young cabbage leaves that are strong natural plant sinks. Accordingly, we propose that aphids generally prefer to obtain more nutrition rather than avoiding host plant defense, and total amount of nutrition that aphids could obtain is significantly influenced by leaf ontogeny or source-sink status of feeding sites.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196219</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6db7e37c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by He-He Cao, Zhan-Feng Zhang, Xiao-Feng Wang, Tong-Xian Liu&lt;/p&gt;

To elucidate the association between renal hyperfiltration (RHF) and incident proteinuria, the data from 11,559,520 Korean adults who had undergone health screenings ≥ 3 times between 2009 and 2014 and had glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and negative dipstick test for proteinuria at baseline, were retrospectively analyzed. GFR was estimated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation based on serum creatinine, and RHF was defined as GFR &gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile adjusted for sex, age, body size, and diabetes and/or hypertension medication. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of incident proteinuria in the RHF was 1.083 (95% CI, 1.069~1.097) compared to that of the non-RHF with Cox regression model. The association between RHF and incident proteinuria was not only in diabetic but also in non-diabetic subjects. This association was not observed in women (p for interaction &amp;lt;0.001). A reverse J-shaped association was found between the adjusted GFR slope and aHR of incident proteinuria. Both lower and higher GFR were associated with incident proteinuria in men. In conclusion, RHF was associated with incident proteinuria in men.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT).

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>a3308d99</fingerprint><recrawled>1522787045837</recrawled><crawled>1522777258471</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><title>A probabilistic, distributed, recursive mechanism for decision-making in the brain</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006033</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/47MpyGKP0b0/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Javier A.

The purpose of this study was to compare cardiovascular and respiratory effects of two volumes of bupivacaine 0.25% (0.2 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;—treatment BUP02—and 0.4 mL kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; –treatment BUP04) administered epidurally at the lumbosacral intervertebral space in dogs anesthetized with isoflurane. This experimental prospective randomized crossover design trial used six mixed breed adult dogs, four neutered males and two spayed females. Each dog was anesthetized on three different occasions: the first for isoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) measurement, and the following two assigned treatments (BUP02 or BUP04). On the two treatment days, anesthesia was induced and maintained with isoflurane at 1.3 MAC during the experiments. Cardiovascular and respiratory measurements were recorded before (T0) and 5, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after the epidural administration of bupivacaine. Comparisons between and within groups were performed by a mixed-model ANOVA and Friedman’s test when appropriate followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test or Dunnet’s test to compare time points within each treatment with T0 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Mean arterial pressure decreased significantly from 15 to 90 minutes after the administration of BUP02 and from 5 to 60 minutes in BUP04, with lower values in BUP04 than in BUP02 lasting up to 30 minutes after bupivacaine administration. No significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance were observed in either treatment. Hypoventilation was only detected in BUP04. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial oxygen content decreased after both treatment of bupivacaine with no significant decrease in oxygen delivery. Two dogs in BUP04 developed Horner’s syndrome. The epidural administration of 0.4 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of bupivacaine to dogs in sternal recumbency anesthetized with isoflurane 1.3 MAC caused more cardiovascular and respiratory depression than 0.2 mL.kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195867</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>84badf49</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Raquel Sartori Gonçalves Dias, João Henrique Neves Soares, Douglas dos Santos e Castro, Maria Alice Kuster de Albuquerque Gress, Marcela Lemos Machado, Pablo E.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Despite an increase in dengue outbreaks and the arrival of chikungunya and Zika disease in Panama, studies on the demographic history of the invasive &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes that are the principle vectors of these diseases are still lacking in this region. Here, we assess the genetic diversity of these mosquitoes in order to decipher their invasion histories into the Isthmus of Panama. DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase I gene obtained from 30 localities in 10 provinces confirmed the presence of more than one mitochondrial haplogroup (i.e., maternal lineage) in each species. The invasion of &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt; was likely from temperate European countries, as the most frequent and widespread haplogroup in Panama harbored variants that are uncommon elsewhere in the Americas. Two infrequent and geographically restricted &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; haplotypes appear to have subsequently invaded Panama from neighboring Costa Rica and the USA, respectively. In addition, we recovered two deeply divergent mitochondrial clades in Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;. The geographic origins of these clades is unknown, given that divergence in the mitochondrial genome is probably due to ancient population processes within the native range of &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, rather than due to its global expansion out of Africa. However, Panamanian &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mitochondrial sequences within the first clade were closely related to others from Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and the USA, suggesting two separate invasions from Western Hemisphere source populations. The pattern of increased genetic diversity in &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Panama is likely facilitated by the numerous land and water inter-connections across the country, which allows them to enter via sea- and land-transportation from Europe, North, Central and South America. Our results here should be considered in disease mitigation programs if emergent arboviruses are to be effectively diminished in Panama through vector suppression.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194874</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ee1f55c6</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gilberto A.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a prevalent method for gene expression analysis, depending on the stability of the reference genes for data normalization. &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; are popular ornamental plants which are famous for the long flowering period. However, no systematic studies on reference genes in &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; have yet been conducted. In the present study, we selected nine candidate reference genes (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EIF5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) and evaluated their expression stability in different tissues during floral development of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and, RefFinder). Results showed that &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt; were the most stably expressed and suitable reference genes for both of &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; species. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; exhibited high expression stability in &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; was a suitable reference gene for &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; in different flower development stages. &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt; was an unsuitable reference gene for gene expression normalization due to significant variations in expression across all samples.

We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks -- including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression -- and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Lopez, R.</name></author><title>Bayesian Inference for a Generative Model of Transcriptome Profiles from Single-cell RNA Sequencing [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16275cac7a9:78bdcb2:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292037v1?rss=1</link><published>1522393200000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020377?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>606af543</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020377?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nicolas Rivas</name></author><title>Mesoscopic electrohydrodynamic simulations of binary colloidal suspensions</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523245617000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b852e8:34f43e70</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020377?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04060-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aqueous rechargeable zinc/sodium vanadate batteries with enhanced performance from simultaneous insertion of dual carriers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aqueous rechargeable zinc/sodium vanadate batteries with enhanced performance from simultaneous insertion of dual carriers, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04060-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04060-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries are promising energy storage devices but suffer from the limited choice of positive electrodes.

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195682</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2c4ab63a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;

The predicted interactome and symbiosis proteins provide a valuable basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of root nodule symbiosis in soybean.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288811v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Zhang, L.</name></author><title>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110-Glycine max interactome provides candidate proteins associated with symbiosis [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16267535771:6103c7f:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288811v1?rss=1</link><published>1522134000000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-i?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.9.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bebba971</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-i?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Balasubramani, A.</name></author><title>Zooming in on human lymph nodes</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>1</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feced8:34f43e70</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-i?rss=1</link><published>1523554636000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195044</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;
Aranbaltza is an archaeological complex formed by at least three open-air sites. Between 2014 and 2015 a test excavation carried out in Aranbaltza III revealed the presence of a sand and clay sedimentary sequence formed in floodplain environments, within which six sedimentary units have been identified. This sequence was formed between 137–50 ka, and includes several archaeological horizons, attesting to the long-term presence of Neanderthal communities in this area. One of these horizons, corresponding with Unit 4, yielded two wooden tools. One of these tools is a beveled pointed tool that was shaped through a complex operational sequence involving branch shaping, bark peeling, twig removal, shaping, polishing, thermal exposition and chopping. A use-wear analysis of the tool shows it to have traces related with digging soil so it has been interpreted as representing a digging stick. This is the first time such a tool has been identified in a European Late Middle Palaeolithic context; it also represents one of the first well-preserved Middle Palaeolithic wooden tool found in southern Europe. This artefact represents one of the few examples available of wooden tool preservation for the European Palaeolithic, allowing us to further explore the role wooden technologies played in Neanderthal communities.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195044</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3d1a2f4e</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joseba Rios-Garaizar, Oriol López-Bultó, Eneko Iriarte, Carlos Pérez-Garrido, Raquel Piqué, Arantza Aranburu, María José Iriarte-Chiapusso, Illuminada Ortega-Cordellat, Laurence Bourguignon, Diego Garate, Iñaki Libano&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Body fatness is associated with risk of coronary heart disease and it has been postulated that epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) may have a particularly detrimental effect because of its localized toxic effects. We therefore aimed to examine the association between EAT and coronary artery calcification and compared this with associations for visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and other regional fat depots.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study of 487 Chinese participants aged 50 years old and above, living in Singapore. Participants, free from known diabetes mellitus and coronary heart diseases, completed interviews, a health screening to evaluate obesity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, and computed tomography scans of the abdomen and coronary arteries. Associations between regional fat depots and subclinical atherosclerosis defined as CAC&gt; = 100 were determined by multiple logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) was highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (Pearson r = 0.72) and trunk fat mass (r = 0.66). The age and sex-adjusted odd ratio (OR) (in 1-SD increase) of subclinical atherosclerosis was 1.28 (1.01–1.61) for EAT and 1.40 (1.04–1.88) for VAT. These associations were weaker and non-significant after adjusting for markers of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia. Total body fat, subcutaneous abdominal fat, and leg, arm and trunk fat mass were not significantly associated with atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;VAT and EAT showed similar associations with coronary artery calcification and the associations could be mediated by traditional risk factors in this ethnic Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196328</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524678327596</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c6013754</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nang Ei Ei Khaing, Tai E.

The peregrine falcon &lt;i&gt;Falco peregrinus&lt;/i&gt; is renowned for attacking its prey from high altitude in a fast controlled dive called a stoop. Many other raptors employ a similar mode of attack, but the functional benefits of stooping remain obscure. Here we investigate whether, when, and why stooping promotes catch success, using a three-dimensional, agent-based modeling approach to simulate attacks of falcons on aerial prey. We simulate avian flapping and gliding flight using an analytical quasi-steady model of the aerodynamic forces and moments, parametrized by empirical measurements of flight morphology. The model-birds’ flight control inputs are commanded by their guidance system, comprising a phenomenological model of its vision, guidance, and control. To intercept its prey, model-falcons use the same guidance law as missiles (pure proportional navigation); this assumption is corroborated by empirical data on peregrine falcons hunting lures. We parametrically vary the falcon’s starting position relative to its prey, together with the feedback gain of its guidance loop, under differing assumptions regarding its errors and delay in vision and control, and for three different patterns of prey motion. We find that, when the prey maneuvers erratically, high-altitude stoops increase catch success compared to low-altitude attacks, but only if the falcon’s guidance law is appropriately tuned, and only given a high degree of precision in vision and control. Remarkably, the optimal tuning of the guidance law in our simulations coincides closely with what has been observed empirically in peregrines. High-altitude stoops are shown to be beneficial because their high airspeed enables production of higher aerodynamic forces for maneuvering, and facilitates higher roll agility as the wings are tucked, each of which is essential to catching maneuvering prey at realistic response delays.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ypEvewr7kSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robin Mills, Hanno Hildenbrandt, Graham K.

The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by β-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt;. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196054</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fea54681</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Lamilla, Douglas Braga, Rui Castro, Carolina Guimarães, Livia V.

The precursor ribosomal RNA is processed by multiple steps of nucleolytic cleavage to generate mature rRNAs. Utp24 is a PIN domain endonuclease in the early 90S precursor of small ribosomal subunit and is proposed to cleave at sites A1 and A2 of pre-rRNA. Here we determine the crystal structure of Utp24 from &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt; at 2.1 angstrom resolution. Utp24 structurally resembles the ribosome assembly factor Utp23 and both contain a Zn-finger motif. Functional analysis in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; shows that depletion of Utp24 disturbs the assembly of 90S and abolishes cleavage at sites A0, A1 and A2. The 90S assembled with inactivated Utp24 is arrested at a post-A0-cleavage state and contains enriched nuclear exosome for degradation of 5&apos; ETS. Despite of high sequence conservation, Utp24 from other organisms is unable to form an active 90S in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that Utp24 needs to be precisely positioned in 90S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195409</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1d85d779</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Betânia M.

The e-liquids used in electronic cigarettes (E-cigs) consist of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), nicotine, and chemical additives for flavoring. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, and while some have been tested for toxicity in the laboratory, most have not. Here, we developed a 3-phase, 384-well, plate-based, high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to rapidly triage and validate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids. Our data demonstrated that the PG/VG vehicle adversely affected cell viability and that a large number of e-liquids were more toxic than PG/VG. We also performed gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis on all tested e-liquids. Subsequent nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that e-liquids are an extremely heterogeneous group. Furthermore, these data indicated that (i) the more chemicals contained in an e-liquid, the more toxic it was likely to be and (ii) the presence of vanillin was associated with higher toxicity values. Further analysis of common constituents by electron ionization revealed that the concentration of cinnamaldehyde and vanillin, but not triacetin, correlated with toxicity. We have also developed a publicly available searchable website (www.eliquidinfo.org). Given the large numbers of available e-liquids, this website will serve as a resource to facilitate dissemination of this information. Our data suggest that an HTS approach to evaluate the toxicity of multiple e-liquids is feasible. Such an approach may serve as a roadmap to enable bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to better regulate e-liquid composition.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Djo1Z76O3OU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by M.

In this study, we investigated whether the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular adhesion molecule-1), E-selectin und L-selectin, which are involved in homing of vascular stem cells, are upregulated by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells from septic patients and would be associated with improved clinical outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 30) and without sepsis (n = 10), and healthy volunteers (n = 15) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin was detected on CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells by flow cytometry. The severity of disease was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II. Serum concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 were determined by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin and L-selectin by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells was significantly upregulated in septic patients, and correlated with sepsis severity. Furthermore, high expression of VCAM-1 by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells revealed a positive association with mortalitiy (p&amp;lt;0.05). Furthermore, significantly higher serum concentrations of VEGF and Ang-2 were found in septic patients, however none showed a strong association with survival. Our data suggest, that VCAM-1 upregulation on CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells could play a crucial role in their homing in the course of sepsis. An increase in sepsis severity resulted in both and increase in CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells and VCAM-1-expression by those cells, which might reflect an increase in need for vascular repair.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195064</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>318d5621</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Patry, Christoph Remmé, Christian Betzen, Burkhard Tönshoff, Benito A.

Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) provide a solid basis for promising SMMs. In this study, we investigated the behavior of functionalized EMFs on a gold surface (EMF‐L‐Au). Having followed the systems molecular dynamics paths, we observed that the chemically locked inner cluster inside fullerene cage will remain locked even at room temperature due to the ligand‐effect.

Endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) provide a solid basis for promising SMMs. In this study, we investigated the behavior of functionalized EMFs on a gold surface (EMF‐L‐Au). Having followed the systems molecular dynamics paths, we observed that the chemically locked inner cluster inside fullerene cage will remain locked even at room temperature due to the ligand‐effect. We have located multiple possible minima with different charge arrangements between EMF‐L‐Au fragments. Remarkably, the charge state of the EMF inner cluster remained virtually constant and so magnetic properties are expected to be untouched. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/298885v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>We add CUDA GPU C program code to RNAfold to enable both it to be run on nVidia gaming graphics hardware and so that many thousands of RNA secondary structures can be computed in parallel.

Dynamin Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), but they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly, presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation, and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission, even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions, Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation.

Dynamin Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), but they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly, presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation, and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission, even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions, Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation. Together, we decouple regulatory and scission functions of dynamins and report a scission-independent, isoform-specific regulatory role for Dyn1 in CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k6hPvNlNbzg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>ca45db9d</fingerprint><recrawled>1524078544053</recrawled><crawled>1524074766525</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><title>A noncanonical role for dynamin-1 in regulating early stages of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in non-neuronal cells</title><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005377</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/k6hPvNlNbzg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Saipraveen Srinivasan</name></author><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb316e:76251cdd</id><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005377</link><published>1524085200000</published></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00301</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00301/20180404/images/medium/bi-2018-00301u_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00301&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Pooled DNA from multiple unknown organisms arises in a variety of contexts, for example microbial samples from ecological or human health research. Determining the composition of pooled samples can be difficult, especially at the scale of modern sequencing data and reference databases. Here we propose a novel method for taxonomic profiling in pooled DNA that combines the speed and low-memory requirements of k-mer based pseudoalignment with a likelihood framework that uses base quality information to better resolve multiply mapped reads. We apply the method to the problem of classifying 16S rRNA reads using a reference database of known organisms, a common challenge in microbiome research. Using simulations, we show the method is accurate across a variety of read lengths, with different length reference sequences, at different sample depths, and when samples contain reads originating from organisms absent from the reference. We also assess performance in real 16S data, where we reanalyze previous genetic association data to show our method discovers a larger number of quantitative trait associations than other widely used methods. We implement our method in the software Karp, for k-mer based analysis of read pools, to provide a novel combination of speed and accuracy that is uniquely suited for enhancing discoveries in microbial studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T3dI4mAo5X0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mark Reppell, John Novembre&lt;/p&gt;

Transverse lines, called Harris Lines (HL), osteological markers of recovery from growth arrest episodes, are visible in radiograms of recent and Pleistocene fossil bones. Since on the one hand they mark stressful episodes in life, and on the other are mainly used to trace health fluctuations in prehistoric human communities, I used a cave bear population to check if the processes that could affect the specie’ condition were in any way reflected in the bone structure. 392 bear bones from Bear Cave in Kletno (collection: Department of Palaeozoology, University of Wrocław), dated as 32 100 ±1300 to &gt;49 000 years BP, were radiologically examined. The bones were found in a non-anatomical position; morphological analysis indicated that they belonged to different individuals. HL shadows were observed on 9 tibiae and 3 radii: 8.8% out of the 59 tibiae and 77 radii and 3.1% of all the bones. At least 3 transverse lines were recognised in those cases; the specimens were histologically examined. The bear individuals in question experienced regular malnutrition periods during their ontogeny. Starvation resulting in growth inhibition involved young individuals, aged 1 to 4 years. Juveniles aged 6 months, i.e. before weaning, or younger, showed no signs of nutritional stress. Starvation periods associated with seasonal food deficit were not long or common and had no significant effect on the development and welfare of the species.

This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors, and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Noroy, C.</name></author><title>Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector proteins (S4TE) 2.0: improved tools for type IV effector prediction, analysis and comparison [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>4</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162c4eefbaf:1e3bde9:9f3b30f2</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301150v1?rss=1</link><published>1523689200000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8a332231</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chuanyi Jia</name></author><title>CO oxidation on Ru–Pt bimetallic nanoclusters supported on TiO2(101): The effect of charge polarization</title><unread>True</unread><published>1521694813000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88e7:7d6c1c1c</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021712?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34395</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34395</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522929880058</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b75b3067</fingerprint><description>Rhythmic theta frequency (~5-12 Hz) oscillations coordinate neuronal synchrony and higher frequency oscillations across the cortex.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Product packaging has long been used by the tobacco industry to target consumers and manipulate product perceptions. This study examines the extent to which cigarillo packaging influences perceptions of product flavor, taste, smell, and appeal.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A web-based experiment was conducted among young adults. Participants viewed three randomly selected cigarillo packs, varying on pack flavor descriptor, color, type, branding, and warning—totaling 180 pack images. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of pack elements on product perceptions.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2,664 current, ever, and never little cigar and cigarillo users participated. Cigarillo packs with a flavor descriptor were perceived as having a more favorable taste (β = 0.21, p &amp;lt; .001) and smell (β = 0.14, p &amp;lt; .001) compared to packs with no flavor descriptor. Compared to packs with no color, pink and purple packs were more likely to be perceived as containing a flavor (β = 0.11, p &amp;lt; .001), and were rated more favorably on taste (β = 0.17, p &amp;lt; .001), smell (β = 0.15, p &amp;lt; .001), and appeal (β = 0.16, p &amp;lt; .001). While warnings on packs decreased favorable perceptions of product taste (pictorial: β = -0.07, p = .03) and smell (text-only: β = -0.08, p = .01; pictorial: β = -0.09, p = .007), warnings did not moderate the effects of flavor descriptor or color.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative evidence that cigarillo packaging alters consumers’ cognitive responses, and warnings on packs do not suffice to overcome the effects of product packaging. The findings support efforts at federal, state, and local levels to prohibit flavor descriptors and their associated product flavoring in non-cigarette products such as cigarillos, along with new data that supports restrictions on flavor cues and colors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196236</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fab54a29</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Clare Meernik, Leah M.

Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reflects cerebral perfusion and tissue oxygen consumption, which decline in some patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or stroke, especially during exercise. Its physiologic basis and clinical significance remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the association of SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with oxygen transport physiology and known prognostic factors during both rest and exercise in patients with HFrEF or stroke. Thirty-four HFrEF patients, 26 stroke patients, and 17 healthy controls performed an incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a bicycle ergometer. Integrated near-infrared spectroscopy and automatic gas analysis were used to measure cerebral tissue oxygenation and cardiac and ventilatory parameters. We found that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rest; peak) were significantly lower in the HFrEF (66.3±13.3%; 63.4±13.8%,) than in the stroke (72.1±4.2%; 72.7±4.5%) and control (73.1±2.8%; 72±3.2%) groups. In the HFrEF group, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at rest (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;) and peak SctO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) were linearly correlated with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak), and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; between -0.561 and 0.677, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Stepwise linear regression showed that SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; was determined by partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide at rest (P&lt;sub&gt;ET&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt;), hemoglobin, and mean arterial pressure at rest (MAP&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt;) (adjusted R = 0.681, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), while SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was mainly affected by peak carbon dioxide production (V˙CO2peak) (adjusted R = 0.653, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) in patients with HFrEF. In conclusion, the study delineates the relationship of cerebral saturation and parameters associated with oxygen delivery. Moreover, SctO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; and SctO&lt;sub&gt;2rest&lt;/sub&gt; are correlated with some well-recognized prognostic factors in HFrEF, suggesting its potential prognostic value.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196299</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb85d3f1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Jen Chen, Jong-Shyan Wang, Chih-Chin Hsu, Pyng-Jing Lin, Feng-Chun Tsai, Ming-Shien Wen, Chi-Tai Kuo, Shu-Chun Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194655</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f86d40e5</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Kayadjanian, Lauren Schwartz, Evan Farrar, Katherine Anne Comtois, Theresa V.

It has been proposed that the pathogenesis of HF may involve the action of mitochondria. We evaluate three different mouse models of HF: tachycardiomyopathy, HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), and LV myocardial ischemia and hypertrophy. Regardless of whether LVEF is preserved, our results indicate that the three models share common features: an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species followed by ultrastructural alterations in the mitochondrial cristae and loss of mitochondrial integrity that lead to cardiomyocyte death.

It has been proposed that the pathogenesis of HF may involve the action of mitochondria. We evaluate three different mouse models of HF: tachycardiomyopathy, HF with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), and LV myocardial ischemia and hypertrophy.

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194823</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>590fb747</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

Microbicides are an important strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV but, so far, the most advanced tenofovir-based microbicides have had modest efficacy. This has been related to adherence problems and high prevalence of tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 strains. P3 is a new peptide with potent activity against HIV that may be a good microbicide candidate. In this work P3 was formulated in a gel of hydroxyethyl cellulose and its activity, stability and safety profile in Balb/c mice were evaluated. HIV infection was fully blocked by a 1.5% gel containing P3 at the IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (366.4 nM) concentration. The antiviral activity did not change at 4°C during 4 months and at 25, 37 and 65°C for 1 week. P3 was stable and fully functional at acidic pH up to 24h, under different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of genital fluids up to 48h. P3 had no antibacterial activity and did not affect sperm motility and vitality. Finally, P3 didn’t cause significant alterations in the vaginal epithelium of Balb/c mice at 0.06 (456.8 μM) and 0.2 mg/day (1522.7 μM) doses. These findings indicate that P3 is an excellent candidate for further development as a microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV transmission in women.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c50e618d</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inês Bártolo, Ana Rita Diniz, Pedro Borrego, João Pedro Ferreira, Maria Rosário Bronze, Helena Barroso, Rui Pinto, Carlos Cardoso, João F.

This has been related to adherence problems and high prevalence of tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 strains. P3 is a new peptide with potent activity against HIV that may be a good microbicide candidate. In this work P3 was formulated in a gel of hydroxyethyl cellulose and its activity, stability and safety profile in Balb/c mice were evaluated. HIV infection was fully blocked by a 1.5% gel containing P3 at the IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (366.4 nM) concentration. The antiviral activity did not change at 4°C during 4 months and at 25, 37 and 65°C for 1 week. P3 was stable and fully functional at acidic pH up to 24h, under different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of genital fluids up to 48h. P3 had no antibacterial activity and did not affect sperm motility and vitality. Finally, P3 didn’t cause significant alterations in the vaginal epithelium of Balb/c mice at 0.06 (456.8 μM) and 0.2 mg/day (1522.7 μM) doses. These findings indicate that P3 is an excellent candidate for further development as a microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV transmission in women.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Inês Bártolo</name></author><title>Evaluation of the fusion inhibitor P3 peptide as a potential microbicide to prevent HIV transmission in women</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb1:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</link><published>1524085200000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195350</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>433d97fb</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nichole E.

Leukemic cells often carry chromosome aberrations which generate chimeric genes of pathogenetic, diagnostic, and prognostic importance. New rearrangements giving rise to novel fusion genes define hitherto unrecognized genetic leukemia subgroups. G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular genetic analyses were done on bone marrow cells from a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and secondary myelodysplasia. The G-banding analysis revealed the karyotype 46,XX,del(21)(q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. FISH on metaphase spreads with a &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; break apart probe demonstrated that part of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; (from 21q22) had moved to chromosome band 5p15. RNA sequencing showed in-frame fusion of &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; (from 5p15), something that was verified by RT-PCR together with Sanger sequencing. Further FISH analyses with &lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; home-made break apart/double fusion probes showed a red signal (&lt;i&gt;PDCD6&lt;/i&gt;) on chromosome 5, a green signal on chromosome 21 (&lt;i&gt;RUNX1&lt;/i&gt;), and two yellow fusion signals, one on der(5) and the other on der(21). Reassessment of the G-banding preparations in light of the FISH and RNA-sequencing data thus yielded the karyotype 46,XX,t(5;21)(p15;q22)[9]/46,XX[2]. The t(5;21)(p15;q22)/&lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; was detected only by performing molecular studies of the leukemic cells, but should be sought after also in other leukemic/myelodysplastic cases with del(21q).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196181</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524159904718</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d1890391</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ioannis Panagopoulos, Ludmila Gorunova, Eva-Marie Jacobsen, Kristin Andersen, Francesca Micci, Sverre Heim&lt;/p&gt;

The t(5;21)(p15;q22)/&lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&lt;/i&gt; was detected only by performing molecular studies of the leukemic cells, but should be sought after also in other leukemic/myelodysplastic cases with del(21q).</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196181</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ioannis Panagopoulos</name></author><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;RUNX1-PDCD6&amp;lt;/i&gt; fusion resulting from a novel t(5;21)(p15;q22) chromosome translocation in myelodysplastic syndrome secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524171600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162df027bce:43f7901:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196181</link><published>1524171600000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8d52184e</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jie Liu</name></author><title>An efficient implementation of semiempirical quantum-chemical orthogonalization-corrected methods for excited-state dynamics</title><unread>True</unread><published>1524229155000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d1f:9f3b30f2</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022466?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/The_Discrete_Existence_of_Singlet_Nitrenium_Ions_Revisited_Computational_Studies_of_Non-Aryl_Nitrenium_Ions_and_Their_Rearrangements/6070925</originId><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><crawled>1522671789268</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><fingerprint>444f5812</fingerprint><description>Nitrenium ion species are examined using computational methods (DFT, MP2, coupled-cluster, and a composite method, CBS-APNO) with a particular emphasis on non-aromatic species (i.e. those lacking an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring in direct conjugation with the formal nitrenium ion center.)

A macromolecular complex of the enzymes involved in human &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; purine biosynthesis, the purinosome, has been shown to consist of a core assembly to regulate the metabolic activity of the pathway. However, it remains elusive whether the core assembly itself can be selectively controlled in the cytoplasm without promoting the purinosome. Here, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of the cytoplasmic activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) selectively promotes the formation of the core assembly, but not the purinosome, in cancer cells. However, alternative signaling cascades that are associated with the plasma membrane-bound PDK1 activity, including Akt-mediated cascades, regulate neither the core assembly nor the purinosome in our conditions. Along with immunofluorescence microscopy and a knock-down study against PDK1 using small interfering RNAs, we reveal that cytoplasmic PDK1-associated signaling pathways regulate subcellular colocalization of three enzymes that form the core assembly of the purinosome in an Akt-independent manner. Collectively, this study reveals a new mode of compartmentalization of purine biosynthetic enzymes controlled by spatially resolved signaling pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195989</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524073508287</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f491e0c8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Danielle L.

Comparative genomics of E. faecium will help to reveal the genomic differences responsible for the said properties. In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is &apos;less open&apos; due to absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains. Additional, genes associated with colonization within gastrointestinal tract were detected across all the strains. Beyond shared genetic features; this study particularly identified genes that are responsible to impart probiotic, non-pathogenic and pathogenic features to the strains of E. faecium. The study also provides insights into the acquired and intrinsic drug resistance genes, which will be helpful for better understanding of the physiology of antibiotic resistance in E. faecium strains. In addition, we could identify genes contributing to the intrinsic ability of 17OM39 E. faecium isolate to be a potential probiotic.

Although the genetics of H3K27M-glioma are well characterized, their cellular architecture remains uncharted. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in 3321 cells from six primary H3K27M-glioma and matched models.

Genetic variability in insect vectors is valuable to study vector competence determinants and to select non-vector populations that may help reduce the spread of vector-borne pathogens. We collected and tested vector competency of 15 isofemale lines of Asian citrus psyllid, &lt;i&gt;Diaphorina citri&lt;/i&gt;, vector of ‘&lt;i&gt;Candidatus&lt;/i&gt; Liberibacter asiaticus’ (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las is associated with huanglongbing (citrus greening), the most serious citrus disease worldwide. &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults were collected from orange jasmine (&lt;i&gt;Murraya paniculata&lt;/i&gt;) hedges in Florida, and individual pairs (females and males) were caged on healthy &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants for egg laying. The progeny from each pair that tested &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-negative by qPCR were maintained on &lt;i&gt;Murraya&lt;/i&gt; plants and considered an isofemale line. Six acquisition tests on &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;citri&lt;/i&gt; adults that were reared as nymphs on &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-infected citrus, from various generations of each line, were conducted to assess their acquisition rates (percentage of qPCR-positive adults). Three lines with mean acquisition rates of 28 to 32%, were classified as ‘good’ acquirers and three other lines were classified as ‘poor’ acquirers, with only 5 to 8% acquisition rates. All lines were further tested for their ability to inoculate &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by confining &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las-exposed psyllids for one week onto healthy citrus leaves (6–10 adults/leaf/week), and testing the leaves for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las by qPCR. Mean inoculation rates were 19 to 28% for the three good acquirer lines and 0 to 3% for the three poor acquirer lines. Statistical analyses indicated positive correlations between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition and inoculation rates, as well as between &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las titer in the psyllids and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;Las acquisition or inoculation rates. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of one of the good and one of the poor acquirer lines revealed differences between them in color morphs and hemocyanin expression, but not the composition of bacterial endosymbionts.

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522422911090</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c9c56a66</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic patients. We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclusively extracranial&lt;/i&gt; oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p &amp;lt; 0.01) was associated with OS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195149</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>489912ba</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian C.

Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p &amp;lt; 0.01) was associated with OS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195149</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Julian C.

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194912</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb35b522</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Yaw Naminse, Jincai Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Using our previously developed and tested Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) Stigma Scale, we investigated factors associated with perceived SRH stigma among adolescent girls in Ghana.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We drew upon data from our survey study of 1,063 females 15-24yrs recruited from community- and clinic-based sites in two Ghanaian cities. Our Adolescent SRH Stigma Scale comprised 20 items and 3 sub-scales (Internalized, Enacted, Lay Attitudes) to measure stigma occurring with sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancy, abortion and family planning service use. We assessed relationships between a comprehensive set of demographic, health and social factors and SRH Stigma with multi-level multivariable linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In unadjusted bivariate analyses, compared to their counterparts, SRH stigma scores were higher among girls who were younger, Accra residents, Muslim, still in/dropped out of secondary school, unemployed, reporting excellent/very good health, not in a relationship, not sexually experienced, never received family planning services, never used contraception, but had been pregnant (all p-values &amp;lt;0.05). In multivariable models, higher SRH stigma scores were associated with history of pregnancy (β = 1.53, CI = 0.51,2.56) and excellent/very good self-rated health (β = 0.89, CI = 0.20,1.58), while lower stigma scores were associated with older age (β = -0.17, 95%CI = -0.24,-0.09), higher educational attainment (β = -1.22, CI = -1.82,-0.63), and sexual intercourse experience (β = -1.32, CI = -2.10,-0.55).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings provide insight into factors contributing to SRH stigma among this young Ghanaian female sample. Further research disentangling the complex interrelationships between SRH stigma, health, and social context is needed to guide multi-level interventions to address SRH stigma and its causes and consequences for adolescents worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195163</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>433a030a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kelli Stidham Hall, Emmanuel Morhe, Abubakar Manu, Lisa H.

Background and objective &lt;p&gt;Potential hepatoxicity is an important clinical concern when administering immunosuppressive therapies to patients infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) increase the likelihood of hepatitis consequent to HBV reactivation, but reported risks and outcomes vary. We determined the risks of liver enzyme elevation in anti-rheumatic drug users from an HBV-endemic region with differing HBV serostatus.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We established retrospective cohorts with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis who: 1) received anti-TNF agents from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2013; 2) received care from 1 June 2011 to 30 June 2013 but only ever used conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Serology results defined three subgroups: HBV surface antigen positive (HBsAg+), HBsAg negative/HBV core antibody positive (HBsAg−/HBcAb+), or uninfected. We compared incidences of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding twice the upper reference limit between HBV serostatus subgroups in each treatment cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 783 patients treated with anti-TNF (n = 472) or DMARDs only (n = 311), HBsAg−/HBcAb+ anti-TNF users had incidence of ALT elevation commensurate with uninfected counterparts (6.1 vs. 6.0/100 person-years), compared to 19.6/100 person-years in HBsAg+ patients (standardized rate ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–8.2); none effected had severe or fatal hepatitis and ALT levels in all HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients remained stable, mostly normalizing spontaneously, or after moderating treatment. Patterns of of ALT elevation associated with differing HBV serostatus in the DMARD cohort, resembled those in anti-TNF users.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large HBV-endemic cohort, the absolute incidence of ALT elevation in anti-TNF users was more than three-fold higher in HBsAg+ patients than in uninfected counterparts; however, no such association was evident in patients with HBsAg−/HBcAb+ serotype, whose risk and outcomes of liver enzyme elevation were similar to uninfected patients, suggesting that anti-TNF use by HBsAg−/HBcAb+ patients is probably safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196210</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524679026474</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>13fdb6f9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ying-Ming Chiu, Mei-Shu Lai, K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

We show that these algorithms increase comparability within large datasets of spectra, facilitating comparative analysis, such as machine learning.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292425v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Brochu, F.</name></author><title>Mass Spectra alignment using virtual lock-masses [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162c02dfb99:17d6a12:34f43e70</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292425v2?rss=1</link><published>1523602800000</published></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24108-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24108-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24108-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dwxNbl6d-Bg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24108-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24108-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Transitions from Ideal to Intermediate Cholesterol Levels may vary by Cholesterol Metric&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dwxNbl6d-Bg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523572833713</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1aaa7faa</fingerprint><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24108-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dwxNbl6d-Bg/s41598-018-24108-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Joseph C.

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3294b76</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve heard him speak on the topic of organic synthesis, you’ve probably heard most of what’s in that piece, but it’s a good summary of his position. Picked up roughly where I left off last time, he has this to say about innovation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One measure of the health of a scientific field is its ability to generate new ideas (as opposed to extensions of already established themes), and to reinvent itself. A familiar idea in discussions of innovation is that it comes in different forms: for example, innovation can focus on new technology (where organic synthesis has tended to shine), or on new processes (where the most innovative work has often been done by process‐development groups in industry), or new business plans (for example, the decision by China to make low‐cost capital available for production of silicon‐based solar cells – a decision that has been enormously important in accelerating the implementation of solar energy). The question facing organic synthesis is not “has the need for new methods of syntheses disappeared?” but rather “What problems – intellectual, empirical, or practical – most require new ideas in synthesis?” Is the future for more of the familiar – what Kuhn called “ordinary science” – or for something more radical, more important, more different fundamentally? (More, perhaps, having the audacity of what Woodward, Eschenmoser, and others suggested and demonstrated 50 years ago?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an uncomfortable question, when you start to think about it. That’s not asking organic chemists what they can do, but what the most important and interesting questions are that they can contribute to. And it’s also asking, “Of the biggest and most important questions in general, which ones can organic synthesis help with?” Whitesides lists some of those in broad strokes (catalysis, materials science, synthetic biology, automation/mechanization of organic chemistry, etc.) and in more particular ones (molecular recognition, origin of life studies, sequence-specific polymers, new biocompatible materials, and more). It may or may not be a coincidence that what many people think of when they think of “organic synthesis” – total synthesis of natural products – does not impinge nearly as much on these topics as some of its practitioners might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are the most important questions that natural products synthesis can provide a key role in helping to answer? One that I can think of is unraveling complex biochemical pathways where more simple chemical matter just doesn’t seem to be able to make things clear. I would adduce rapamycin and FK-506 as examples of this, and there are many others. Indeed, some of the larger pharmaceutical molecules are getting into “non-natural-product” zones of complexity and molecular weight (although, to be sure, they’re generally much easier to make, since we’ve produced them (or their precursors) with that in mind. Modifications of the natural products themselves is another such field, and it’s not an easy one, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are worthy topics, and there are others. But at this point, I want to being in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b02266&quot;&gt;another recent article&lt;/a&gt;, from Phil Baran at Scripps, introducing a special collection of total organic synthesis papers. This introduction is written by someone who’s well acquainted with criticism of the field. Interestingly, he and Whitesides are in agreement on what some of the interesting problems are (automation being one example), but that agreement definitely doesn’t go all the way. That’s because Baran’s article, as mentioned, is deliberately written as a defense of total synthesis, and it reads at times like a response to a prosecutor’s opening statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with some of what Prof. Baran has to say as well. I think, for example, that he’s absolutely right when he says that the application of AI and automation to really complex molecules is still a long way off. We might disagree on just what a “long way” measures out to, but there’s no doubt that retrosynthetic planning of such molecules and their actual forward synthesis is a really significant challenge that only humans – and pretty damned competent humans, at that – are now able to meet. (Drug-sized molecules are another matter). Of course, Prof. Baran and I are in agreement about many other points as well, a big one (mentioned above) being the use of such complex molecules to work out biochemical pathways. There’s often no alternative, and there are several fields that would be in much worse shape if synthetic chemistry hadn’t evolved far enough to deal with such structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key place where I think Baran and Whitesides, though, do not really come to a meeting of the minds is in the question of “Why?” Some of the responses given in Baran’s article – total synthesis trains students well, industry likes to hire people who do it, it’s a solid way to prove compound structures, it’s beautiful in and of itself –  are the same justifications I was given when I was first working in the field in the mid-1980s. And it’s not that time has falsified all of these, but it may have made some of them a bit less compelling. It may seem odd to say it, but for some time I bought into this worldview completely, and even now I don’t completely reject it. But sometimes, I think it seems to the total synthesis community that you’re either for them or against them, and that apostasy is always a short, fatal, step away. The shortest and most fatal of those steps is wondering in general if total synthesis of natural products still pays its way, scientifically. Here’s Whitesides again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .The trick will be to find classes of problems that return complex synthesis (Organic Synthesis, perhaps in an evolved and more expansive and ambitious form) to a central role in the future of the field, rather than having it become an extraordinary specialty or craft, admired but occupying an increasingly isolated place as the rest of synthesis moves on. The argument that complex synthesis, by itself, is beautiful is doubtless true, but also dangerous. Most societies have valued beautiful products of human imagination and skill, but paying to support the artists who produce them has been another matter entirely. And, unfortunately, the beauty of Organic Synthesis is not something that most non‐synthetic‐chemists can understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Technical expertise is not, by itself, enough to sustain a field (consider mechanical watchmaking or glass‐blowing). To prosper, Organic Synthesis must also solve recognizable problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exact argument for beauty is one of the ones made in Prof. Baran’s article, actually. It’s not his main point – actually his main points and those of Prof. Whitesides might well end up being closer than you’d think – but it does represent the sort of sticking point that keeps coming up between practioners of the field and those outside it. I’m outside it, and have been for many years. I can understand it and appreciate many of its qualities, but I’m not able – unfortunately – to tell people that its best days are yet to come. They might be. But they might not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>d7a7bd9e</fingerprint><crawled>1523969627741</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><title>More Thoughts of George Whitesides – And of Phil Baran</title><description>The other day I wrote up some comments about a recent article from George Whitesides.

We report a computational model for the assembly of HIV-1 Gag into immature viral particles at the plasma membrane. To reproduce experimental structural and kinetic properties of assembly, a process occurring on the order of minutes, a coarse-grained representation consisting of a single particle per Gag molecule is developed. The model uses information relating the functional interfaces implicated in Gag assembly, results from cryo electron-tomography, and biophysical measurements from fluorescence microscopy, such as the dynamics of Gag assembly at single virions. These experimental constraints eliminated many classes of potential interactions, and narrowed the model to a single interaction scheme with two non-equivalent interfaces acting to form Gags into a hexamer, and a third interface acting to link hexamers together. This model was able to form into a hexameric structure with correct lattice spacing and reproduced biologically relevant growth rates. We explored the effect of genomic RNA seeding punctum growth, finding that RNA may be a factor in locally concentrating Gags to initiate assembly. The simulation results infer that completion of assembly cannot be governed simply by Gag binding kinetics. However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196133</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>589e7c9f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael D.

However the addition of membrane curvature suggests that budding of the virion from the plasma membrane could factor into slowing incorporation of Gag at an assembly site resulting in virions of the same size and number of Gag molecules independent of Gag concentration or the time taken to complete assembly. To corroborate the results of our simulation model, we developed an analytic model for Gag assembly finding good agreement with the simulation results.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196133</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Michael D.

Along with the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems, traffic data collection technologies have progressed fast. The emergence of innovative data collection technologies such as remote traffic microwave sensor, Bluetooth sensor, GPS-based floating car method, and automated license plate recognition, has significantly increased the variety and volume of traffic data. Despite the development of these technologies, the missing data issue is still a problem that poses great challenge for data based applications such as traffic forecasting, real-time incident detection, dynamic route guidance, and massive evacuation optimization. A thorough literature review suggests most current imputation models either focus on the temporal nature of the traffic data and fail to consider the spatial information of neighboring locations or assume the data follow a certain distribution. These two issues reduce the imputation accuracy and limit the use of the corresponding imputation methods respectively. As a result, this paper presents a Kriging based data imputation approach that is able to fully utilize the spatiotemporal correlation in the traffic data and that does not assume the data follow any distribution. A set of scenarios with different missing rates are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two other widely used methods, historical average and K-nearest neighborhood. Comparison results indicate that the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy and is more flexible compared to other methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195957</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1f5c87d9</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongtai Yang, Jianjiang Yang, Lee D.

The main objective of this work was to quantify and update the U.S. Midwest agricultural state of Iowa’s contribution of nitrate-nitrogen to the Mississippi River stream network against the backdrop of the ongoing problem of Gulf of Mexico hypoxia. To achieve this objective, we used stream nitrate and discharge data collected from 1999 until 2016 at 23 Iowa stream sites near watershed outlets, along with publicly-available data for sites downstream of Iowa on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. Our analysis shows that Iowa contributes between 11 and 52% of the long-term nitrate load to the Mississippi-Atchafalaya Basin, 20 to 63% to the Upper Mississippi River Basin, and 20 to 89% to the Missouri River Basin, with averages of 29, 45 and 55% respectively. Since 1999, nitrate loads in the Iowa-inclusive basins have increased and these increases do not appear to be driven by changes in discharge and cropping intensity unique to Iowa. The 5-year running annual average of Iowa nitrate loading has been above the 2003 level for ten consecutive years, implying that Gulf hypoxic areal goals, also based on a 5-year running annual average, will be very difficult to achieve if nitrate retention cannot be improved in Iowa. An opportunity exists for land managers, policy makers and conservationists to manifest a positive effect on water quality by targeting and implementing nitrate reducing-practices in areas like Iowa while avoiding areas that are less likely to affect Gulf of Mexico hypoxia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195930</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>fb3f2429</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher S.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8a626eb7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Background/Objectives &lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity (AO) is associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases; however, this association is less clear for non-obese people. We estimated the association of AO and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and disease in non-obese adult individuals from Chile.&lt;/p&gt; Subjects/Methods &lt;p&gt;5248 adults (15 years of age or older) of both sexes from the Chilean National Health Survey (October 2009 –September 2010, response rate 85%.) were included. Information on myocardial infarction and stroke was self-reported. BMI, waist circumference (WC), arterial pressure, plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels were measured. Predictive accuracy of WC was evaluated by area under curve of receiver operating characteristic analysis and cut off points were established by Youden Index. Relationship between AO and CVRF was analyzed by Chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Normal weight/overweight/obesity were present in 34.4%/45.2%/18.1% of men and 33.4%/33.6%/27.5% of women. Predictive accuracy of WC to identify at least one CVRF was 0.70/0.67 and optimal cutoff points for WC in non-obese subjects were 91/83 cm in men/women, respectively. AO was present in 98.2%/99.1% of obese, 70.5%/77.4% of overweight and 12.4%/16.4% of normal weight men/women. AO was associated with increased frequency of CVRF in overweight men (6/8 and stroke) and women (4/8) and higher frequency in normal weight men (8/8 and myocardial infarction/stroke) and women (6/8 and myocardial infarction).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;WC cutoff points calculated for non-obese chilean population discriminate more differences in CVRF in normal weight woman. AO significantly increases the frequency of CVRF and diseases in overweight and especially normal weight individuals. WC can be used as a low cost, feasible and reproducible predictor for CVRF in non-obese individuals in most clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194644</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>744df93c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beatriz Villanueva, Antonio Arteaga, Alberto Maiz, Víctor A.

Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternatives. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and generation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. Our collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. Our toolkit and protocols have allowed us to create more than 500 constructs with ease. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the effectiveness of commonly used inducers for tetracycline-responsive promoters. As proof of concept we examined the role of the exoribonuclease XRN2 in transcription termination by RNAseq.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f6d0d0c8</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Roman J.

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014–15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)–meaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524245962605</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a647418a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Deepak Shewade, Arun M.

The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Hemant Deepak Shewade</name></author><title>Provider reported barriers and solutions to improve testing among tuberculosis patients ‘eligible for drug susceptibility test’: A qualitative study from programmatic setting in India</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524258000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e803:7d6c1c1c</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</link><published>1524258000000</published></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25162?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><crawled>1522119250699</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1412accd</fingerprint><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25162?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>NA</name></author><unread>False</unread><published>1522119250699</published><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626560930b:6ce0b:76251cdd</id><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25162?af=R</link><summary><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1479.1.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e2511d79</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jarvis, M.</name></author><title>SciLine scores successes in first five months of operation</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>23</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c83:34f43e70</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1479-a?rss=1</link><published>1522345097000</published></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

Studies disrupting the chemokine pathway CX3CL1 (fractalkine)/ CX3CR1 have shown decreased atherosclerosis in animal models but the techniques used to interrupt the pathway have not been easily translatable into human trials. DNA vaccination potentially overcomes the translational difficulties. We evaluated the effect of a DNA vaccine, targeted to CX3CR1, on atherosclerosis in a murine model and examined possible mechanisms of action. DNA vaccination against CX3CR1, enhanced by dendritic cell targeting using DEC-205 single chain variable region fragment (scFv), was performed in 8 week old ApoE-/- mice, fed a normal chow diet. High levels of anti-CX3CR1 antibodies were induced in vaccinated mice. There were no apparent adverse reactions to the vaccine. Arterial vessels of 34 week old mice were examined histologically for atherosclerotic plaque size, macrophage infiltration, smooth muscle cell infiltration and lipid deposition. Vaccinated mice had significantly reduced atherosclerotic plaque in the brachiocephalic artery. There was less macrophage infiltration but no significant change to the macrophage phenotype in the plaques. There was less lipid deposition in the lesions, but there was no effect on smooth muscle cell migration. Targeted DNA vaccination to CX3CR1 was well tolerated, induced a strong immune response and resulted in attenuated atherosclerotic lesions with reduced macrophage infiltration. DNA vaccination against chemokine pathways potentially offers a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195657</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4cb30a82</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jimmy Jianheng Zhou, Yuan Min Wang, Vincent W.

These reactions have a lot of variables in them and can be notoriously finicky about what combination of these will actually give decent amounts of product. At the same time, it appears that almost any given metal-catalyzed coupling reaction is capable of being optimized, if you care enough. So this is a good field for both miniaturized reaction searching (as in the link above) and for machine learning (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going after what’s often an even more challenging case, the C-N &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination&quot;&gt;Buchwald-Hartwig&lt;/a&gt; coupling. That one gets used a lot in medicinal chemistry (we like nitrogen atoms), but it’s also a well-known beast when it comes to variation in yield. You can honestly never be quite sure that it’s going to work well when you set it up on a new system for the first time, because there are a lot of conditions (solvent, catalyst, additives) to pick from, and often very little guidance about which region of reaction space is going to be most fruitful. This work, a Princeton/Merck collaboration, is an attempt to calculate a way out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the two approaches mentioned in the first paragraph are not an either/or case. Far from it. If you’re going to do machine learning, you’re going to need a lot of reliable data (positive and negative) to feed into the model, and how better to generate that than in an automated, high-throughput setup? That’s especially true as you start adding in more reaction variables: every one of those can increase the complexity of the machine learning model in an exponential fashion, and stuff gets out of control quickly under those conditions. So the question is, can ML provide something useful here, and can it outperform the simpler-to-implement regression models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d definitely want robotic help up front: the data set was the yields from 4,608 coupling reactions  (15 aryl or heteroaryl halides, 4 ligands, 3 bases, and 23 isoxazole additives). About 30% of the reactions gave no product at all – valuable fodder for the model – and the rest were spread in a wide range from “pretty darn good” to “truly crappy”. Just what you need. At this point, you need to figure out just what you’re going to tell the system about these reactions (a nontrivial decision). Too few (or wrongly chosen) parameters, and you’ll never get a useful model. Too many, and you risk an overfitted model that looks good from a distance but is both hard to implement and still not robust. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_(software)&quot;&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/02/14/science.aar5169.DC1/aar5169-Ahenman-SM_revision_1.pdf&quot;&gt;is used to provide&lt;/a&gt; atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors of the substrate(s), catalysts, bases, and additives. So what goes in are electrostatics at various atoms, vibrational modes (frequencies and intensities), dipole moments, electronegativity, surface areas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the team took 70% of the data as a training set to see if they could predict the outcomes in the other 30%, and ran the data through a whole set of possibilities: linear and polynomial regression for starters, then k-nearest neighbors, Bayes-generalized linear models, layered neural networks, random-forest techniques, etc. Only when they got to that last two did they start to see real predictive value, and random-forest seems to have been the clear winner. Its predictions, even using only 5% of the data, were better than linear-regression models tuned up on the whole 70%. But even so, there were limits. “Activity cliffs” are always a problem in these reactions, and those are hard to pick up (even with 4,608 reactions to train on!) The wider the range of chemical/reaction space you’re trying to cover with your model, the better the chance you’re going to miss these things (and the better the chance you’re going to end up with an overfitted model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way out of that is to restrict your question to a narrower region of potential reactions (and thus get more fine detail into the model). But that, naturally, makes it less useful: after all, the dream is a Buchwald-Hartwig Box, where you walk up, draw the structures of your two reactants (no matter what they might be), and it pauses for a moment and spits out a set of good reaction conditions. That’s. . .still a little ways off. But I do have to say that this current effort beats both human intuition (insofar as anyone has any about these reactions) and other attempts to calculate likely starting points. So it is a real improvement, and the finding that random-forest techniques outperformed everything else is worth building on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group did try putting in some additives that were not in the training set at all, to see how the model would handle them. And the answer is “not bad”: the root-mean-square error in predicted yields for the original test set versus reference set was about 8%, and the RMSE for the new additive set was about 11%. So it was not quite as good, but on the right track. (By comparison, the single-layer neural network model had about a 10% error on the original set, while the other methods came in at 15 to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested a look at the final random-forest procedure to see if there was anything that could be learned about the mechanism (a tall order, from what I know about the field). Some of the most important descriptors were things like electrostatic charge on the isoxazole additive’s atoms, its calculated LUMO, and its carbon NMR shifts. That suggests that the additive’s electrophilic behavior was important, but those parameters taken by themselves weren’t enough to produce any kind of useful model on their own. Still, a check of isoxazoles from both ends of the scale suggested that the more electrophilic ones were capable of undergoing a side reaction with the Pd catalyst that reduced yields, which may well be what the model was picking up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d say that this paper does show (as have some others) that machine-learning techniques are going to help us out eventually in predicting reaction conditions, even if that day has not quite arrived. When you get down to it, the parameters going into this model are not particularly complicated, so it may well be a good sign that it’s worked as well as it has. You’d have to think that larger data sets and new inputs can only going to make these things perform better (after plenty of human effort and care, of course), and that’s leaving aside the general possibility of improved algorithms. I think we’ll get there, but we’re not there now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><fingerprint>59032214</fingerprint><crawled>1524660735497</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><title>Calculate Your Way Out of Bad Yields</title><description>I wrote a little while back about a brute-force approach to finding metal-catalyzed coupling conditions.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although evidence suggests that dopaminergic systems are involved in pain processing, the effects of dopaminergic interventions on pain remains questionable. This randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was aimed at exploring the effect of the dopamine agonist apomorphine on experimental pain evoked by cold stimulation and on spontaneous pain in patients with lumbar radicular (neuropathic) pain.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data was collected from 35 patients with chronic lumbar radiculopathy (18 men, mean age 56.2±13 years). The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>845996b</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by May Haddad, Dorit Pud, Roi Treister, Erica Suzan, Elon Eisenberg&lt;/p&gt;

The following parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and 30, 75 and 120 minutes subsequent to a subcutaneous injection of 1.5 mg apomorphine or placebo: cold pain threshold and tolerance in the painful site (ice pack, affected leg) and in a remote non-painful site (12°C water bath, hand), and spontaneous (affected leg) pain intensity (NPS, 0–100).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and twenty minutes following apomorphine (but not placebo) injection, cold pain threshold and tolerance in the hand increased significantly compared to baseline (from a median of 8.0 seconds (IQR = 5.0) to 10 seconds (IQR = 9.0), p = 0.001 and from a median of 19.5 seconds (IQR = 30.2) to 27.0 seconds (IQR = 37.5), p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In addition, apomorphine prolonged cold pain tolerance but not threshold in the painful site (from a median of 43.0 seconds (IQR = 63.0) at baseline to 51.0 seconds (IQR = 78.0) at 120 min, p = 0.02). Apomorphine demonstrated no superiority over placebo in reducing spontaneous pain intensity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous results in healthy subjects, showing that apomorphine increases the ability to tolerate cold pain and therefore suggesting that dopaminergic interventions can have potential clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>May Haddad</name></author><title>The effects of a dopamine agonist (apomorphine) on experimental and spontaneous pain in patients with chronic radicular pain: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4608:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195287</link><published>1522962000000</published></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-s?rss=1</originId><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.19.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>628a7d4f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-s?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>VanHook, A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Some studies have suggested that depressive disorders may play a vital role in the incidence of hip fractures. However, nationwide data are lacking regarding the association between depressive disorders and hip fractures.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore the association between depressive disorders and new-onset hip fractures.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective study of 11,207 patients with depressive disorders and 11,207 control patients using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the risk of hip fractures in patients with depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence rate ratio of hip fractures between patients with depressive disorders and controls was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.99, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). After adjustment for potential confounders in multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model, patients with depressive disorders were found to have 1.34 times higher risk of hip fractures than controls (95% CI = 1.08–1.66, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .008).

Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</canonicalUrl><crawled>1524074227579</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yu Lan</name></author><title>Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in China: An up-dated cross-sectional study</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe36:34f43e70</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</link><published>1524085200000</published></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32293</originId><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32293</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523356396929</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>52ea5dd3</fingerprint><description>Clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) mediates internalization of many transmembrane proteins but the mechanisms of cargo recruitment during CIE are poorly understood.

Adapting community-based protected areas to local context and evaluating their success across a range of possible socio-economic and ecological outcomes depends, in part, on understanding the perceptions of local actors. This article presents results from a mixed methods study that focuses on how and why religious identity, a prominent aspect of Ghanaian culture, is related to perceptions of the performance of several Community Resource Management Areas (CREMAs). CREMAs are a form of Ghanaian protected area that emphasizes community participation and a range of socio-economic and ecological objectives. Using importance-satisfaction analysis, large-scale survey results show that respondents that identify as Christians consistently assign greater importance to CREMA outcomes than do those that identify with Traditional religions. Education and whether respondents were native to an area (both of which were correlated with religious identity) were also systematically related to perceptions of CREMA importance, with those that are educated and non-native to an area tending to assign higher importance to CREMA outcomes. Follow up focus group participants from the Avu Lagoon CREMA suggest that the patterns result from differing ‘openness’ to new ideas, relative dependence on natural resources, acceptance of Traditional practices associated with conservation, and a sense, for some, that ecological conditions are divinely ordained. Christianity, education and non-nativity are associated with much larger performance gaps, particularly with respect to socio-economic impacts. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for conservation interventions and the use of perceptions in assessing protected area performance.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195498</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9befc27c</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Grant Murray, Andrew Agyare&lt;/p&gt;

After carotid artery stenting, the procurement of information about blood flow redistribution among brain-feeding arteries and its time trend is essential to understanding a patient’s physiological background and to determine their care regimen. Cerebral blood flow has been measured twice following carotid artery stenting in few previous studies, with some discrepancies in the results. The purpose of this study was to measure cerebral blood flow at multiple time points after carotid artery stenting, and to elucidate the time trend of cerebral blood flow and redistribution among arteries. Blood flow rates in 11 subjects were measured preoperatively, at one day, one week, and about three months, respectively after carotid artery stenting by using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The target vessels were the bilateral internal carotid arteries, the basilar artery, and the bilateral middle cerebral arteries. Lumen was semi-automatically defined using an algorithm utilizing pulsatility. The results showed that blood flow rates in the stented internal carotid artery and the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery increased following carotid artery stenting. Blood flow rates in the contralateral internal carotid artery and the basilar artery gradually declined, and they were lower than the preoperative values at three months after stenting. The sum of blood flow rates of the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery increased after carotid artery stenting, and then decreased over the next three months. There was no significant change in the blood flow rate in the contralateral middle cerebral artery. From these results, it was concluded that redistribution among the bilateral internal carotid arteries and the basilar artery occurs after carotid artery stenting, and that it takes months thereafter to reach another equilibrium.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195099</canonicalUrl><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ba541727</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hisashi Tanaka, Yoshiyuki Watanabe, Hajime Nakamura, Hiroto Takahashi, Atsuko Arisawa, Takuya Fujiwara, Chisato Matsuo, Noriyuki Tomiyama&lt;/p&gt;

Further, we are able to independently validate with both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ebler, J.</name></author><title>Haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread><engagement>0</engagement><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1628c93523b:9432244:7d6c1c1c</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</link><published>1522738800000</published></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009815?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>75d78626</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009815?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Partha Pratim Pal</name></author><title>Emergence of Landauer transport from quantum dynamics: A model Hamiltonian approach</title><unread>True</unread><published>1523504092000</published><engagement>0</engagement><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b8530b:34f43e70</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009815?af=R</link><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/173005v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Nowadays, it has become almost a necessity for many biologists to execute bioinformatics workflows (WFs) as part of their research.

Computation on data fingerprints is fast: in one example involving complex simulated medical records, the average time to encode one record was 0.53 seconds, and the average pairwise comparison time was 3.75 microseconds. Both processes are trivially parallelizable.

Computation on data fingerprints is fast: in one example involving complex simulated medical records, the average time to encode one record was 0.53 seconds, and the average pairwise comparison time was 3.75 microseconds. Both processes are trivially parallelizable.

Protein trafficking within cilia is mediated by the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery composed of large protein complexes. The BBSome consists of eight BBS proteins encoded by causative genes of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and has been implicated in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by connecting the IFT machinery to cargo GPCRs. Membrane recruitment of the BBSome to promote cargo trafficking has been proposed to be regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase ARL6/BBS3, through its interaction with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome. We here investigated how the BBSome core subcomplex composed of BBS1, BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 assembles and interacts with ARL6, and found that the ARL6–BBS1 interaction is reinforced by BBS9. &lt;i&gt;BBS1&lt;/i&gt;-knockout (KO) cells showed defects in the ciliary entry of other BBSome subunits and ARL6, and in ciliary retrograde trafficking and the export of the GPCRs, Smoothened and GPR161. The trafficking defect of these GPCRs was rescued by the exogenous expression of wild-type BBS1, but not by its mutant lacking BBS9-binding ability. Our data thus indicate that the intact BBSome is required for retrograde trafficking of GPCRs out of cilia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195005</canonicalUrl><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>761ea815</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shohei Nozaki, Yohei Katoh, Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuhisa Nakayama&lt;/p&gt;
