The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in The Netherlands in 2006 and was replaced by PHiD-CV10 in 2011. Data on carriage prevalence of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; serotypes in children and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and older adults were collected to examine the impact of PCVs on carriage and IPD in The Netherlands. Pneumococcal carriage prevalence was determined by conventional culture of nasopharyngeal swabs in 24-month-old children in 2015/2016. Data were compared to similar carriage studies in 2005 (pre-PCV7 introduction), 2009, 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. Invasive pneumococcal disease isolates from hospitalized children &amp;lt;5years and adults &gt;65 years (2004–2016) were obtained by sentinel surveillance. All isolates were serotyped by Quellung. Serotype invasive disease potential was calculated using carriage and nationwide IPD data in children. The overall pneumococcal carriage rate was 48% in 2015/2016, lower than in 2010/2011 (64%) and pre-vaccination in 2005 (66%). Carriage of the previously dominant non-vaccine serotypes 19A and 11A has declined since 2010/2011, from 14.2% to 4.6% and 4.2% to 2.7%, respectively, whereas carriage of serotypes 6C and 23B has increased (4.2% to 6.7% and 3.9% to 7.3%), making serotypes 6C and 23B the most prevalent carriage serotypes. IPD incidence declined in children (20/100,000 cases in 2004/2006 to 6/100,000 cases in 2015/2016) as well as in older adults (63/100,000 cases to 51/100,000 cases). Serotypes 6C, 23B and 11A have high carriage prevalence in children, but show low invasive disease potential. Serotype 8 is the main causative agent for IPD in older adults (11.3%). In conclusion, 10 years after the introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children in The Netherlands shifts in carriage and disease serotypes are still ongoing. Surveillance of both carriage and IPD is important to assess PCV impact and to predict necessary future vaccination strategies in both children and older adults.</content></content><author><name>Marloes Vissers</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marloes Vissers, Alienke J.

The accuracy of this process is largely dependent on the availability of machine-readable resources associating synonyms and abbreviations commonly found in biomedical literature with uniform identifiers.

In FamPlex the gene-level constituents of families and complexes are defined in a flexible format allowing for multi-level, hierarchical membership.

The present study aimed to explore how state self-control influences the intertemporal decisions made by individuals with high and low trait self-control. State self-control, represented by the degree of depletion, was manipulated by conducting Stroop tasks with different levels of difficulty, and the intertemporal decision task was used as a self-control task. Compared with participants with high trait self-control, the preferences of participants with low trait self-control for immediate rewards were more vulnerable to the difficulty of depletion tasks. Throughout the experimental stages, the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants with high trait self-control was significantly higher than that of participants with low trait self-control, indicating that individuals with high trait self-control may have stronger and more stable self-control abilities.</content></content><author><name>Yuan Guan</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Guan, Jiamei He&lt;/p&gt;

Various limitations hinder the timely and accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in pediatric patients. The present study aims to investigate the potential of metabolomics and cytokine profiling for improving the diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis. Serum and plasma samples were collected from pediatric patients for metabolic and inflammatory mediator analyses respectively. Targeted metabolic profiling was performed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Flow Injection Analysis Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry and targeted cytokine/chemokine profiling was completed using a multiplex platform to compare children with and without appendicitis. Twenty-three children with appendicitis and 35 control children without appendicitis from the Alberta Sepsis Network pediatric cohorts were included. Metabolomic profiling revealed clear separation between the two groups with very good sensitivity (80%), specificity (97%), and AUROC (0.93 ± 0.05) values. Inflammatory mediator analysis also distinguished the two groups with high sensitivity (82%), specificity (100%), and AUROC (0.97 ± 0.02) values. A biopattern comprised of 9 metabolites and 7 inflammatory compounds was detected to be significant for the separation between appendicitis and control groups. Integration of these 16 significant compounds resulted in a combined metabolic and cytokine profile that also demonstrated strong separation between the two groups with 81% sensitivity, 100% specificity and AUROC value of 0.96 ± 0.03. The study demonstrated that metabolomics and cytokine mediator profiling is capable of distinguishing children with appendicitis from those without.

To provide population based gestational age and sex and parity specific reference ranges for cord length.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Population based registry study.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;Medical Birth Registry of Norway 1999–2013.&lt;/p&gt; Population &lt;p&gt;All singleton births (gestational age&gt;22weeks&amp;lt;45 weeks) (n = 856 300).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics and odds ratios of risk factors for extreme cord length and adverse outcomes based on logistic regression adjusted for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Main outcome measures &lt;p&gt;Short or long cord (&amp;lt;10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or &gt;90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile), cord knot and entanglement, adverse pregnancy outcomes including perinatal and intrauterine death.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Increasing parity, maternal height and body mass index, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of a long cord. Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence. Extreme cord length, entanglement and cord knot are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including perinatal death.

To provide population based gestational age and sex and parity specific reference ranges for cord length.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Population based registry study.&lt;/p&gt; Setting &lt;p&gt;Medical Birth Registry of Norway 1999–2013.&lt;/p&gt; Population &lt;p&gt;All singleton births (gestational age&gt;22weeks&amp;lt;45 weeks) (n = 856 300).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Descriptive statistics and odds ratios of risk factors for extreme cord length and adverse outcomes based on logistic regression adjusted for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Main outcome measures &lt;p&gt;Short or long cord (&amp;lt;10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; or &gt;90&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile), cord knot and entanglement, adverse pregnancy outcomes including perinatal and intrauterine death.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Increasing parity, maternal height and body mass index, and diabetes were associated with increased risk of a long cord. Large placental and birth weight, and fetal male sex were factors for a long cord, which again was associated with a doubled risk of intrauterine and perinatal death, and increased risk of adverse neonatal outcome. Anomalous cord insertion, female sex, and a small placenta were associated with a short cord, which was associated with increased risk of fetal malformations, placental complications, caesarean delivery, non-cephalic presentation, perinatal and intrauterine death. At term, cord knot was associated with a quadrupled risk of perinatal death. The combination of a cord knot and entanglement had a more than additive effect to the association to perinatal death. There was a more than doubled risk of recurrence of a long or short cord, knot and entanglement in a subsequent pregnancy of the same woman.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Cord length is influenced both by maternal and fetal factors, and there is increased risk of recurrence. Extreme cord length, entanglement and cord knot are associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including perinatal death. We provide population based reference ranges for umbilical cord length.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Combining a Toggle Switch and a Repressilator within the AC-DC Circuit Generates Distinct Dynamical Behaviors</title><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218300619%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D04983570a3dc5f6819ece64023d6f574</link><id>9eIPIKV4kOcW5lEUHqUkf3UaeBlngqwYuFsoLusj66Y=_1624f343bdc:4135cb0:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405471218300619-fx1.jpg</url><width>375</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>375</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218300619</canonicalUrl><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218300619%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D04983570a3dc5f6819ece64023d6f574</originId><crawled>1521747246044</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell Systems</title><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/24054712</streamId></origin><fingerprint>dbbb786d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Ruben Perez-Carrasco, Chris P.

Tuberculosis places a staggering burden on human health globally. The new World Health Organisation End-TB Strategy has highlighted the urgent need for more effective TB vaccines to improve control of the disease. Protein-based subunit vaccines offer potential as safe and effective generators of protective immunity, and the use of particulate vaccine formulation and delivery by the pulmonary route may enhance local immunogenicity. In this study, novel particulate subunit vaccines were developed utilising biodegradable poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid) (PLGA) slow-release particles as carriers for the &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; lipoprotein MPT83, together with the adjuvants trehalose-dibehenate (TDB) or Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL). Following delivery by the pulmonary or subcutaneous routes, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines were assessed in a murine model of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; infection. When delivered peripherally, these vaccines induced modest, antigen-specific Th1 and Th17 responses, but strong anti-MPT83 antibody responses. Mucosal delivery of the PLGA(MPT83) vaccine, with or without TDB, increased antigen-specific Th17 responses in the lungs, however, PLGA-encapsulated vaccines did not provide protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. By contrast, peripheral delivery of DDA liposomes containing MPT83 and TDB or MPL, stimulated both Th1 and Th17 responses and generated protection against &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; challenge. Therefore, PLGA-formulated vaccines primarily stimulate strong humoral immunity, or Th17 responses if used mucosally, and may be a suitable carrier for vaccines against extracellular pathogens.

Background &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Western Australian (WA) Government introduced the Four-Hour Rule (FHR) program. The policy stated that most patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) were to be seen and either admitted, transferred, or discharged within 4 hours. This study utilised de-identified data from five participating hospitals, before and after FHR implementation, to assess the impact of the FHR on several areas of ED functioning.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A state (WA) population-based intervention study design, using longitudinal data obtained from administrative health databases via record linkage methodology, and interrupted time series analysis technique.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;There were 3,214,802 ED presentations, corresponding to 1,203,513 ED patients.After the FHR implementation, access block for patients admitted through ED for all five sites showed a significant reduction of up to 13.2% (Rate Ratio 0.868, 95%CI 0.814, 0.925) per quarter. Rate of ED attendances for most hospitals continued to rise throughout the entire study period and were unaffected by the FHR, except for one hospital. Pattern of change in ED re-attendance rate post-FHR was similar to pre-FHR, but the trend reduced for two hospitals. ED occupancy was reduced by 6.2% per quarter post-FHR for the most ‘crowded’ ED. ED length of stay and ED efficiency improved in four hospitals and deteriorated in one hospital. Time to being seen by ED clinician and Did-Not-Wait rate improved for some hospitals. Admission rates in post-FHR increased, by up to 1% per quarter, for two hospitals where the pre-FHR trend was decreasing.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The FHR had a consistent effect on ‘flow’ measures: significantly reducing ED overcrowding and access block and enhancing ED efficiency. Time-based outcome measures mostly improved with the FHR. There is some evidence of increased ED attendance, but no evidence of increased ED re-attendance. Effects on patient disposition status were mixed. Overall, this reflects the value of investing resources into the ED/hospital system to improve efficiency and patient experience.

&lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; is the most speciose genus of the order Cingulata, including approximately 40% of known living armadillos. Nine species are currently recognized, although comprehensive analyses of the entire genus have never been done. Our aim is to revise the taxonomy of the long-nosed armadillos and properly define the taxa. We examined 2126 specimens of &lt;i&gt;Dasypus&lt;/i&gt; preserved in 39 different museum collections, including 17 type specimens. Three complementary methods were applied to explore morphological datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative morphological variation in discrete characters was assessed by direct observations of specimens. Linear morphometric variation was based on external data and cranial measurements of 887 adult skulls. The shape and size of the skull was abstracted through two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of dorsal, lateral and ventral views of respectively 421, 211, and 220 adult specimens. Our results converge on the recognition of eight living species (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;beniensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;kappleri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mazzai&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;novemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pastasae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pilosus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sabanicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;), and three subspecies of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;septemcinctus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hybridus&lt;/i&gt;, and a new subspecies from Cordoba described here).

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</content></content><author><name>Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that, for reproducibility and progress of human genomic research, data sharing is critical. For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared data’s FAIRness.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmCLx4LfFZo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Manuel Corpas</name></author><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Corpas, Nadezda V.

&lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; spp. constitute important traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Xinjiang is one of two diversity hotspots in China in which eight &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species occur, two of which are endemic to the region. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships of Xinjiang &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species (including &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;yuminensis&lt;/i&gt;) within the genus are unclear. In the present study, we sequenced the chloroplast (cp) genomes of seven &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species in Xinjiang using the Illumina HiSeq platform, with the aim of assessing the global structural patterns of the seven cp genomes and identifying highly variable cp DNA sequences. These were compared to previously sequenced &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; cp genomes. Phylogenetic analysis was then used to evaluate the relationships of the Xinjiang species and assess the evolution of an undivided stigma. The seven cp genomes ranged from 151,764 to 152,112 bp, presenting a traditional quadripartite structure. The gene order and gene content of the seven cp genomes were identical. A comparison of the 13 cp genomes indicated that the structure is highly conserved. Ten highly divergent regions were identified that could be valuable in phylogenetic and population genetic studies. The phylogenetic relationships of the 13 &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; species inferred from the protein-coding genes, large single-copy, small single-copy, and inverted repeat regions were identical and highly resolved. The phylogenetic relationships of the species corresponded with their geographic distribution patterns, in that the north group (consisting of eight species from Xinjiang and Heilongjiang in North China) and the south group (including six species from South China) were basically divided at 40°N. Species with an undivided stigma were not monophyletic, suggesting that this trait might have evolved several times in the genus.</content></content><author><name>Yan Li</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yan Li, Zhirong Zhang, Junbo Yang, Guanghui Lv&lt;/p&gt;

We illustrate use cases with three analyses of electronic health records (EHRs): (1) pairwise comparison of patient records, (2) analysis of cohort structure, and (3) evaluation of methods for generating simulated patient data.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS2</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1624d3d0584:3d95f31:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</originId><published>1521702000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8676fee2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/MyBJiMhSYAE/s41467-018-03558-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03558-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/MyBJiMhSYAE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Sangwan Sim</name></author><crawled>1521714267524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03558-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/MyBJiMhSYAE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] The Nonbilayer Lipid MGDG and the Major Light-Harvesting Complex (LHCII) Promote Membrane Stacking in Supported Lipid Bilayers</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1628d23c837:5644f:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00118/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00118u_0009.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>157</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118</originId><crawled>1522786355255</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6e66b282</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00118/20180403/images/medium/bi-2018-00118u_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00118&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Context &lt;p&gt;Obese patients are raising specific questions in emergency care such as equipment issues or urgent procedures. Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04–1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22–1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32–3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38–2.49).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity.

Cerium (Ce) belongs to the rare earth elements (REEs), and although it is not essential for plants, it can stimulate growth and other physiological processes. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of Ce on seed germination, initial seedling growth, and vegetative growth in rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) cv. Morelos A-98. During the germination process, the seeds were treated with Ce concentrations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 μM; after 5 d, germination percentage was recorded and after 10 d seedling growth was measured. For vegetative growth, a hydroponic system was established where 14-d-old plants without previous Ce treatment were transferred into nutrient solution. After two weeks of acclimatizing, 0, 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce were added to the nutrient solution for 28 d. Ce significantly increased germination and the initial growth variables of the seedlings. During vegetative growth, Ce increased plant height, number of tillers, root volume, and shoot fresh and dry biomass, without affecting root biomass weight. With low Ce concentrations (25 and 50 μM), the concentrations of chlorophylls and amino acids in the shoots were similar to those in the control, like amino acid concentration in the roots at a concentration of 25 μM Ce. Conversely, the concentration of total sugars increased in the shoot with the application of 25, 50, and 100 μM Ce, and in the roots with the application of 50 μM Ce. Also, Ce did not affect the concentration of macro or micronutrients in the shoots. However, in the roots, the high Ce concentration decreased the concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, and Zn, while the Mg concentration increased. Our results indicate that Ce, at the right concentrations, can function as a biostimulant in rice germination and growth.</content></content><author><name>Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Monzerrat Ramírez-Olvera, Libia Iris Trejo-Téllez, Soledad García-Morales, Juan Antonio Pérez-Sato, Fernando Carlos Gómez-Merino&lt;/p&gt;

but it is not always possible, and investigations are usually done on too few reactions
and solvents to truly generalize. From these studies, we present suggestions on how
best to use data to generalize solvent effects for many different reaction types in a high
throughput manner.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01892</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Imidazopyrazinones (IPYs): Non-Quinolone Bacterial Topoisomerase Inhibitors Showing Partial Cross-Resistance with Quinolones</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01892</link><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_162b13e4bed:5ed2b:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01892/20180410/images/medium/jm-2017-01892q_0010.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>107</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01892</originId><crawled>1523392072685</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f34b8c28</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01892/20180410/images/medium/jm-2017-01892q_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01892&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Tissue perfusion during surgery is important in reducing surgical site infections and promoting healing. This study aimed to determine if insufflation of the open abdomen with heated, humidified (HH) carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) increased visceral tissue perfusion and core body temperature during open abdominal surgery in a rodent model. Using two different rodent models of open abdominal surgery, visceral perfusion and core temperature were measured. Visceral perfusion was investigated using a repeated measures crossover experiment with rodents receiving the same sequence of two alternating treatments: exposure to ambient air (no insufflation) and insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Core body temperature was measured using an independent experimental design with three treatment groups: ambient air, HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cold, dry (CD) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Visceral perfusion was measured by laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) and core body temperature was measured with a rectal thermometer. Insufflation with HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a rodent open abdominal cavity significantly increased visceral tissue perfusion (2.4 perfusion units (PU)/min (95% CI 1.23–3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001) compared with ambient air, which significantly reduced visceral blood flow (-5.20 PU/min (95% CI -6.83- -3.58); p&amp;lt;0.0001). Insufflation of HH CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the open abdominal cavity significantly increased core body temperature (+1.15 ± 0.14°C) compared with open cavities exposed to ambient air (-0.65 ± 0.52°C; p = 0.037), or cavities insufflated with CD CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (-0.73 ± 0.33°C; p = 0.006).

Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale—such as within hosts or between hosts—or by making drastic simplifying assumptions, for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host–pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales—including within hosts, between hosts, and between years—it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bmOg3KEZQRc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>David A.

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability. We present a valid and reliable modular psychometric tool that measures general susceptibility to persuasive techniques. Since its inception, we have successfully implemented the StP-II scale to measure susceptibility to persuasion of IT security officers, the role of psychology of persuasion in cybercrime victims and general persuadability levels of Facebook users; these manuscripts are in preparation. We argue that the StP-II scale shows promise in measuring individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, and is applicable across diverse contexts such as Internet security and cybercrime.</content></content><author><name>David Modic</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Modic, Ross Anderson, Jussi Palomäki&lt;/p&gt;
Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion.

In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales.

As predominant components of hemicelluloses in grasses, methylglucuroarabinoxylans (MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) are sources for the production of acidic xylooligosaccharides (U-XOS). &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; MR44, an engineered biocatalyst to secrete only the XynC xylanase and Axh43 arabinoxylan hydrolase is capable of processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to exclusively U-XOS. The present studies are directed at the explosion on direct alkaline extraction serving for production of U-XOS. Response Surface Methodology was used to optimize xylan extraction conditions on the sweet sorghum bagasse to achieve maximum hemicelluloses yield. The optimized condition was as follows: extraction time of 3.91 h, extraction temperature of 86.1°C, and NaOH concentration (w/w) of 12.33%. Crude xylan extracted with NaOH revealed a compositional analysis of xylose (79.0%), arabinose (5.3%), glucose (1.7%), lignin and ash (5.6%). After neutralization this xylan preparation supported growth of MR44, processing MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; from sweet sorghum and accumulating U-XOS. The quality of U-XOS produced by MR44 using alkaline-treated sweet sorghum bagasse was comparable to that obtained from purified MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Overall, the present study demonstrates that direct alkaline treatment of sweet sorghum bagasse is useful to improve the bioavailability of MeGAX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for MR44-mediated conversion to U-XOS with average degrees of polymerization of 11–12, providing alternative resources with applications in nutrition and human and veterinary medicine.</content></content><author><name>Lusha Wei</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lusha Wei, Tongjing Yan, Yifei Wu, Hui Chen, Baoshan Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER).

&lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens.</content></content><author><name>Hongbo Liu</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongbo Liu, Binghua Zhu, Shaofu Qiu, Yidan Xia, Beibei Liang, Chaojie Yang, Nian Dong, Yongrui Li, Ying Xiang, Shan Wang, Jing Xie, Muti Mahe, Yansong Sun, Hongbin Song&lt;/p&gt;

Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns. Novel strategies are urgently required to prevent the development of drug resistance among diarrhea-inducing pathogens.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Variational nonadiabatic dynamics in the moving crude adiabatic representation: Further merging of nuclear dynamics and electronic structure</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020655?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b6b:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020655?af=R</originId><published>1521083754000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b183e14d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020655?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Loïc Joubert-Doriol</name></author><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Dimeric IgG complexes from IVIg are incapable of inducing &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt; neutrophil degranulation or complement activation</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9c2:9aea0a7d</id><updated>1523394000000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</originId><published>1523394000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>99668730</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195729</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Iwan Kustiawan, Ninotska I.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by hyperphagia, developmental delay, incomplete sexual development, mild-to-moderate intellectual disability, and a variety of challenging behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. The characteristics of PWS can be difficult for caregivers to cope with and are likely to cause significant and long- term caregiver burden. The current study examined burden in 142 caregivers of children and adults with PWS living in the US using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). The study aimed to measure the level of burden in caregivers of individuals with PWS, to explore the impact of PWS on caregiver quality of life, and to assess ZBI as an indicator of that impact.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Caregivers participating in this study were predominantly mothers, 30–59 years old, non-Hispanic Whites, married or in a relationship, with an annual household income slightly distributed towards higher income. Nearly 90% of the caregiver`s children with PWS lived at home. Caregivers experienced high caregiver burden with an average ZBI score of 44.4 ± 15.4. ZBI scores were highest for caregivers of teenage and young adult individuals with PWS (49.2 ± 14.6 and 49.2 ± 14.1, respectively), while those caring for older adults (&gt;30) and the youngest age group had lower scores (38.6 ±10.5 and 34.8 ±12.5, respectively). Caregivers reported that caring for a person with PWS negatively impacted their romantic relationship, ability to work, sleep, and mood. Whereas we did not find strong correlations between family income or level of help the caregiver receives and ZBI scores, the results showed significant correlations and a linear relationship between ZBI scores and caregiver depressed mood, feelings of anxiety, negative romantic relationship impact, as well as sleep and work disruption.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study reveals that PWS incurs high caregiver burden and impacts many aspects of the lives of caregiver. We identified the ZBI as a good predictor of that impact. Our findings draw attention to the critical unmet need for support for caregivers of individuals with PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nathalie Kayadjanian</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathalie Kayadjanian, Lauren Schwartz, Evan Farrar, Katherine Anne Comtois, Theresa V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, about 11% of Tuberculosis (TB) cases occur in people living with HIV (PLHIV) and it is the leading cause of death in this population. An important step towards reducing the incidence and mortality of TB in PLHIV is to reduce the time from onset of symptoms to treatment. Factors related to TB treatment delay therefore need to be understood.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using data from a prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with TB at the National Institute of Infectious Disease, at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil we conducted a survival analysis to identify factors associated with patient and health care treatment delay. In our analysis we included patients who were co-infected with TB and HIV (n = 201). Patients were followed during the course of their TB treatment and information regarding duration of symptoms, sociodemographics and clinical characteristics were collected at the baseline visit.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The median time from onset of initial symptoms to prescription of TB treatment (total delay) was 82 days. From initiation of symptoms to first visit at INI clinic (patient delay), the median was 51 days. From first visit to initiation of treatment (health care delay) the median was 16 days. Illiteracy was associated with greater patient delay [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 2.25, CI 95% 1.29–3.94]. Having had a previous episode of TB (HR = 0.53, CI 95% 0.37–0.74) and being married (HR = 0.71, CI 95% 0.54–0.94) were inversely related to patient delay. Illiteracy was also associated with greater health care delay (HR = 2.83, CI 95% 1.25–5.47) in contrast to high viral load (HR = 0.37, CI 95% 0.24–0.54) and weight loss greater than 10% (HR = 0.54, CI 95% 0.37–0.8), both of which were inversely related to health care delay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study highlights the existence of factors that lead to greater risk of delayed treatment of TB among patients co-infected with HIV and TB. These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Betânia M.

These include factors that can be assessed through targeted interventions which have implications for improving treatment outcomes and, through reduced duration of infectiousness, reduce the incidence of TB in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Structure and dynamics of propylammonium nitrate-acetonitrile mixtures: An intricate multi-scale system probed with experimental and theoretical techniques</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b52:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</originId><published>1522813568000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4586cb60</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021868?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Marco Campetella</name></author><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Topographic effects on dispersal patterns of &amp;lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&amp;lt;/i&gt; at a stand scale in a Spanish heathland</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c50:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522443600000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</originId><published>1522443600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</content></content><author><name>Enrique Cardillo</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

It is capable of dynamic learning from user-supplied data to refine the model construction and yield more confident estimates of promoter strength.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Rebalancing mechanisms during sleep</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-c?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c7f:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1480.3.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-c?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><fingerprint>c2080ed6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1480-c?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Stern, P.</name></author><published>1522345097000</published></item><item><engagement>706</engagement><title>Early life experience shapes neural genome</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1330?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415040f:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1330.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1330?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Genetics</item></keywords><fingerprint>168c6319</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1330?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Song, S., Gleeson, J.

Oral sensitivity to fats varies in individuals influencing nutritional status and health. Variations in oleic acid perception are associated with &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and odorant binding protein (&lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt;) polymorphisms, and 6-&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylthiouracil (PROP) sensitivity, which is mediated by TAS2R38 receptor. L-Arginine (L-Arg) supplementation was shown to modify the perception of the five taste qualities. Here we analyzed the effect of three concentrations (5, 10, 15 mmol/L) of L-Arg on oral perception of oleic acid in forty-six subjects classified for PROP taster status and genotyped for &lt;i&gt;TAS2R38&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;OBPIIa&lt;/i&gt; polymorphisms.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Cheng-Te Chen</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng-Te Chen, Yu-Lan Chen, Yu-Ching Lin, Ching-Lin Hsieh, Jeng-Yi Tzeng, Kuan-Lin Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to construct a computerized adaptive test (CAT) for measuring self-care performance (the CAT-SC) in children with developmental disabilities (DD) aged from 6 months to 12 years in a content-inclusive, precise, and efficient fashion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was divided into 3 phases: (1) item bank development, (2) item testing, and (3) a simulation study to determine the stopping rules for the administration of the CAT-SC. A total of 215 caregivers of children with DD were interviewed with the 73-item CAT-SC item bank. An item response theory model was adopted for examining the construct validity to estimate item parameters after investigation of the unidimensionality, equality of slope parameters, item fitness, and differential item functioning (DIF). In the last phase, the reliability and concurrent validity of the CAT-SC were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The final CAT-SC item bank contained 56 items. The stopping rules suggested were (a) reliability coefficient greater than 0.9 or (b) 14 items administered. The results of simulation also showed that 85% of the estimated self-care performance scores would reach a reliability higher than 0.9 with a mean test length of 8.5 items, and the mean reliability for the rest was 0.86. Administering the CAT-SC could reduce the number of items administered by 75% to 84%. In addition, self-care performances estimated by the CAT-SC and the full item bank were very similar to each other (Pearson &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The newly developed CAT-SC can efficiently measure self-care performance in children with DD whose performances are comparable to those of TD children aged from 6 months to 12 years as precisely as the whole item bank. The item bank of the CAT-SC has good reliability and a unidimensional self-care construct, and the CAT can estimate self-care performance with less than 25% of the items in the item bank. Therefore, the CAT-SC could be useful for measuring self-care performance in children with DD in clinical and research settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23445-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23445-9</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1624cc6c7fd:3d6fea6:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23445-9</originId><published>1521702000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c3817221</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/So_Cs7qyaeA/s41598-018-23445-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23445-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23445-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/So_Cs7qyaeA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Geng Zhou</name></author><crawled>1521706518525</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23445-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23445-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Association of wall shear stress with intracranial aneurysm rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/So_Cs7qyaeA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Dynamics and control of the ERK signaling pathway: Sensitivity, bistability, and oscillations</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715292:9aea0a7d</id><updated>1523307600000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</originId><published>1523307600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>cc10a330</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195513</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yaman Arkun, Mohammadreza Yasemi&lt;/p&gt;
Cell signaling is the process by which extracellular information is transmitted into the cell to perform useful biological functions. The ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) signaling controls several cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The ERK signaling pathway considered in this work starts with an extracellular stimulus and ends with activated (double phosphorylated) ERK which gets translocated into the nucleus. We model and analyze this complex pathway by decomposing it into three functional subsystems. The first subsystem spans the initial part of the pathway from the extracellular growth factor to the formation of the SOS complex, ShC-Grb2-SOS. The second subsystem includes the activation of Ras which is mediated by the SOS complex. This is followed by the MAPK subsystem (or the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) which produces the double phosphorylated ERK upon being activated by Ras. Although separate models exist in the literature at the subsystems level, a comprehensive model for the complete system including the important regulatory feedback loops is missing. Our dynamic model combines the existing subsystem models and studies their steady-state and dynamic interactions under feedback. We establish conditions under which bistability and oscillations exist for this important pathway. In particular, we show how the negative and positive feedback loops affect the dynamic characteristics that determine the cellular outcome.</content></content><author><name>Yaman Arkun</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yaman Arkun, Mohammadreza Yasemi&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression could be discussed as an adaption that promotes repair and counteracts cell damage. Myoglobin is released upon muscle damage of several pathways. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the expression of HSP70 in kidney, heart and brain and of myoglobin in the kidney were associated with the cause of death and the survival times after lethal intoxications with three of the drugs most widely used in our local area (Saxony, Germany) as well as after fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively collected kidney, heart and brain samples of 50 autopsy cases with toxicological proved lethal intoxication (main drugs methamphetamine, morphine, alcohol), 14 TBI cases and 15 fatalities with acute myocardial injury in age- and gender-matched compilations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our main findings suggest that HSP70 is associated with hyperthermal and other stress factors of most cell populations. HSP70 expressions in kidney and heart muscle are useful for a differentiation between fatal intoxications and cases without toxicological influence (p &amp;lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in the cerebral expression patterns between methamphetamine- and morphine-associated deaths compared to alcohol fatalities (p &amp;lt; 0.05). An intensive staining of HSP70 in the pericontusional zone and the hippocampus after TBI (especially neuronal and vascular) was shown even after short survival times and may be useful as an additional marker in questions of vitality or wound age.

They provide important insights toward understanding the OFC&apos;s role in value-based decision making.</description></item><item><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25188?af=R</link><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162652b794b:6cdee:76251cdd</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25188?af=R</originId><published>1522115770699</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b90a554d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25188?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>NA</name></author><crawled>1522115770699</crawled></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Insights into the evolution of extracellular leucine-rich repeats in metazoans with special reference to Toll-like receptor 4 [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269241v2?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1626815fdd0:625f983:34f43e70</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/27/269241</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269241v2?rss=1</originId><published>1522134000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3f2a399b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/269241v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The importance of the widely spread leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif has been studied considering TLRs, the LRR-containing protein involved in animal immune response.

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) can reduce under-5 morbidity and mortality in low-income settings. A program to strengthen IMCI practices through Mentorship and Enhanced Supervision at Health centers (MESH) was implemented in two rural districts in eastern Rwanda in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We estimated cost per improvement in quality of care as measured by the difference in correct diagnosis and correct treatment at baseline and 12 months of MESH. Costs of developing and implementing MESH were estimated in 2011 United States Dollars (USD) from the provider perspective using both top-down and bottom-up approaches, from programmatic financial records and site-level data. Improvement in quality of care attributed to MESH was measured through case management observations (n = 292 cases at baseline, 413 cases at 12 months), with outcomes from the intervention already published. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess uncertainty under different assumptions of quality of care and patient volume.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The total annual cost of MESH was US$ 27,955.74 and the average cost added by MESH per IMCI patient was US$1.06. Salary and benefits accounted for the majority of total annual costs (US$22,400 /year). Improvements in quality of care after 12 months of MESH implementation cost US$2.95 per additional child correctly diagnosed and $5.30 per additional child correctly treated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The incremental costs per additional child correctly diagnosed and child correctly treated suggest that MESH could be an affordable method for improving IMCI quality of care elsewhere in Rwanda and similar settings. Integrating MESH into existing supervision systems would further reduce costs, increasing potential for spread.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Anatole Manzi</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anatole Manzi, Jean Claude Mugunga, Hari S.

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone.

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury still represents a major concern in clinical transplantation, especially in the era of extreme organ shortage and extended criteria donor organs. In the present study we aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in a rat model of arterialized orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Lewis rats were used (n = 144 / 72 OLT cases; 240–340g) as donors and recipients. Livers were flushed and stored in 4°C HTK-solution for 8h before implantation. Recipients were randomly allocated into three experimental groups: RIC 1, RIC 2, Control. In RIC 1, RIC 2 groups, RIC was applied in the recipient before hepatectomy or after reperfusion (4x5-5min IR via clamping the infrarenal aorta), respectively. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 24, 168h post-reperfusion (n = 6 recipient/group/time point). Hepatocellular injury, graft circulation, serum cytokines, tissue redox-stress and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) levels have been assessed. Additional markers were analyzed, using Western blotting and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;RIC 1 group showed significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) improved portal venous and microcirculation flow as well as velocity. RIC has significantly reduced tissue injury according to the serum levels of transaminases and results of histopathological evaluation. Reduced TUNEL-staining (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1–2 vs. Control) and elevated pBAD/BAD ratio was detected in the RIC groups (p&amp;lt;0.01 RIC 1 vs. Control). Supporting findings were obtained from measurements of serum IL-10 as well as tissue malondialdehyde and ATP levels. Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA-expression was significantly higher in RIC 1 compared to Control (p&amp;lt;0.05 RIC 1 vs. Control).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest that RIC might confer potent protection against the detrimental effects of IR injury including tissue damage, apoptosis, graft circulation, inflammation, tissue energetic status in OLT. HO-1 overexpression might play an orchestrating role in RIC mediated organ protection. An earlier intervention (RIC 1 protocol) was more effective than remote conditioning after graft reperfusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Zoltan Czigany</name></author><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zoltan Czigany, Christian Bleilevens, Christian Beckers, Christian Stoppe, Michaela Möhring, Andras Fülöp, Attila Szijarto, Georg Lurje, Ulf P.

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year.

Industry-driven voluntary disease control programs for swine diseases emerged in North America in the early 2000’s, and, since then, those programs have been used for monitoring diseases of economic importance to swine producers. One example of such initiatives is Dr. Morrison’s Swine Health Monitoring Project, a nation-wide monitoring program for swine diseases including the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRS has been extensively reported as a seasonal disease in the U.S., with predictable peaks that start in fall and are extended through the winter season. However, formal time series analysis stratified by geographic region has never been conducted for this important disease across the U.S. The main objective of this study was to use approximately seven years of PRRS incidence data in breeding swine herds to conduct time-series analysis in order to describe the temporal patterns of PRRS outbreaks at the farm level for five major swine-producing states across the U.S. including the states of Minnesota, Iowa, North Carolina, Nebraska and Illinois. Data was aggregated retrospectively at the week level for the number of herds containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus. Basic descriptive statistics were conducted followed by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling, conducted separately for each of the above-mentioned states. Results showed that there was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. Of note, when comparing states, the typical seasonal pattern previously described for PRRS could only be detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states, seasonal peaks every six months were detected within a year. In conclusion, we showed that epidemic patterns are not homogeneous across the U.S, with major peaks of disease occurring through the year. These findings highlight the importance of coordinating alternative control strategies in different regions considering the prevailing epidemiological patterns.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Cyclin-dependent kinase activity is required for type I interferon production [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2950.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1626893ee0e:63522ce:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/13.cover-source.jpg?itok=zzqvvTgr</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2950</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2950.short?rss=1</originId><published>1522168915000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1fa79e06</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2950.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recognition of nucleic acids results in the production of type I IFNs, which activate the JAK/STAT pathway and promote the expression of IFN-stimulated genes.

Simulation is regarded as an effective educational method for the delivery of clinical scenarios. However, exposure to unfamiliar environments during simulation can cause excessive stress among students, possibly leading to unnatural speech/behavior and poor skill learning (Yerkes-Dodson’s law). Thus, assessing students’ stress in a simulation can provide educators with a better understanding of their mental state. This study sought to clarify stress changes throughout the progression of the simulation by measuring heart rate variability and students’ subjective reactions in 74 nursing students. Heart rate variability was calculated in terms of its high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) components during 4 phases—the break, patient care, reporting, and debriefing. Students were interviewed about stress experienced during the simulation. The results showed that HF decreased significantly from the break to the patient care and reporting phases. Furthermore, LF/HF increased significantly from the break to the reporting phases. Approximately 55 students felt stressed during the simulation, 24 of whom felt most stressed during the reporting phase. Therefore, the reporting phase involved high objective and subjective stress. It may be possible that the educator’s evaluative attitude increased students’ stress. Therefore, a stress intervention during the reporting phase might further improve students’ performance during that phase. The debriefing phase did not significantly differ from the break phase for objective stress, and students did not report feeling stressed. Thus, in this phase, they were released from the stress of the reporting phase and the unfamiliar environment. During this phase, they might be able to learn what they could not understand owing to high stress in the patient care and reporting phases. This study provides objective and subjective evidence of students’ stress during simulation, and indicates the necessity of providing support during the reporting phase and the importance of debriefing when using clinical scenarios for teaching clinical skills.</content></content><author><name>Natsuki Nakayama</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Natsuki Nakayama, Naoko Arakawa, Harumi Ejiri, Reiko Matsuda, Tsuneko Makino&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Although severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis-related diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), there is no reliable biomarker of CAD risks in patients with OSA. This study aimed to test our hypothesis that circulating autoantibodies against neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1-Abs) are associated with the prevalence of CAD in patients with OSA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-two adults diagnosed with OSA by polysomnography, 96 patients with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 64 healthy volunteers (HVs) were consecutively enrolled.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;HIV-1 dual infection is a condition that results from infection with at least two HIV-1 variants from different sources. The scarceness of information on this condition is partly due to the fact that its detection is technically challenging. Using next-generation sequencing we defined the extent of HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM).&lt;/p&gt; Material &amp;amp; methods &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six MSM, diagnosed with HIV-1 subtype B infection between 2008 and 2013 were selected for next-generation sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;envelope&lt;/i&gt; V3. Sequencing was performed on 2 plasma samples collected with an interval of &gt; 6 months before the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inspected for dual infection, defined as the presence of two or more monophyletic clusters with ≥ 90% bootstrap support and a mean between-cluster genetic distance of ≥ 10%. To confirm dual infection, deep V3 sequencing of intermediate samples was performed as well as clonal sequencing of the HIV-1 &lt;i&gt;protease-reverse transcriptase&lt;/i&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five of the 74 patients (6.8%) for whom deep sequencing was successful, showed clear evidence of dual infection. In 4 of them, the second strain was absent in the first sample but occurred in subsequent samples. This was highly suggestive for superinfection.

Our observations explain how topo VI tightly coordinates DNA crossover recognition and ATP binding with strand scission, providing useful insights into the operation of type IIB topoisomerases and related meiotic recombination and GHKL ATPase machineries.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Continuous plating/stripping behavior of solid-state lithium metal anode in a 3D ion-conductive framework [Chemistry]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3770.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3a4:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3770</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3770.short?rss=1</originId><published>1523386900000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6b393fc4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3770.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The increasing demands for efficient and clean energy-storage systems have spurred the development of Li metal batteries, which possess attractively high energy densities.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Increasing use of factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors necessitates effective reversal agents to manage bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a novel modified recombinant human FXa, rapidly reverses the anticoagulation effects of direct and indirect FXa inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the ability of andexanet to reverse anticoagulation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and reduce bleeding in rabbits administered edoxaban.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies characterized the interaction of andexanet with edoxaban and its ability to reverse edoxaban-mediated anti-FXa activity. In a rabbit model of surgically induced, acute hemorrhage, animals received edoxaban vehicle+andexanet vehicle (control), edoxaban (1 mg/kg)+andexanet vehicle, edoxaban+andexanet (75 mg, 5-minute infusion, 20 minutes after edoxaban), or edoxaban vehicle+andexanet prior to injury.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Andexanet bound edoxaban with high affinity similar to FXa. Andexanet rapidly and dose-dependently reversed the effects of edoxaban on FXa activity and coagulation pharmacodynamic parameters &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In edoxaban-anticoagulated rabbits, andexanet reduced anti-FXa activity by 82% (from 548±87 to 100±41 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), mean unbound edoxaban plasma concentration by ~80% (from 100±10 to 21±6 ng/ml; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), and blood loss by 80% vs. vehicle (adjusted for control, 2.6 vs. 12.9 g; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). The reduction in blood loss correlated with the decrease in anti-FXa activity (r = 0.6993, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and unbound edoxaban (r = 0.5951, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These data demonstrate that andexanet rapidly reversed the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban, suggesting it could be clinically valuable for the management of acute and surgery-related bleeding.

Microbes usually exist in communities consisting of myriad different but interacting species. These interactions are typically mediated through environmental modifications; microbes change the environment by taking up resources and excreting metabolites, which affects the growth of both themselves and also other microbes. We show here that the way microbes modify their environment and react to it sets the interactions within single-species populations and also between different species. A very common environmental modification is a change of the environmental pH. We find experimentally that these pH changes create feedback loops that can determine the fate of bacterial populations; they can either facilitate or inhibit growth, and in extreme cases will cause extinction of the bacterial population. Understanding how single species change the pH and react to these changes allowed us to estimate their pairwise interaction outcomes. Those interactions lead to a set of generic interaction motifs—bistability, successive growth, extended suicide, and stabilization—that may be independent of which environmental parameter is modified and thus may reoccur in different microbial systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/64piOgqCVHQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Christoph Ratzke</name></author><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Ratzke, Jeff Gore&lt;/p&gt;

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain. However, no differences were observed in patients with diabetes mellitus 2 or Hyperlipidemia. Adipocytes surrounding the ascending aorta present markers of major thermogenic activity than those in subcutaneous tissue. Nevertheless, this characteristic might change, due to unfavorable metabolic conditions such as obesity, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</content></content><author><name>Diana Vargas</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Vargas, Carolina López, Edward Acero, Edgar Benitez, Angélica Wintaco, Jaime Camacho, Marisol Carreño, Juan Umaña, Daniela Jimenez, Said Díaz, Fernando Lizcano&lt;/p&gt;

We test the hypothesis that prehistoric Native American land use influenced the Euro-American settlement process in a South Carolina Piedmont landscape. Long term ecological studies demonstrate that land use legacies influence processes and trajectories in complex, coupled social and ecological systems. Native American land use likely altered the ecological and evolutionary feedback and trajectories of many North American landscapes. Yet, considerable debate revolves around the scale and extent of land use legacies of prehistoric Native Americans. At the core of this debate is the question of whether or not European colonists settled a mostly “wild” landscape or an already “humanized” landscape. We use statistical event analysis to model the effects of prehistoric Native American settlement on the rate of Colonial land grants (1749–1775). Our results reveal how abandoned Native American settlements were among the first areas claimed and homesteaded by Euro-Americans. We suggest that prehistoric land use legacies served as key focal nodes in the Colonial era settlement process. As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</content></content><author><name>Michael R.

As a consequence, localized prehistoric land use legacies likely helped structure the long term, landscape- to regional-level ecological inheritances that resulted from Euro-American settlement.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Biomass smoke from southern Africa can significantly enhance the brightness of stratocumulus over the southeastern Atlantic Ocean [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6bb:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>764d8800</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2924.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Marine stratocumulus clouds cover nearly one-quarter of the ocean surface and thus play an extremely important role in determining the global radiative balance.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has key roles in animal reproduction, including spermatogenesis and ovarian maturation. Many factors influence FSH secretion. However, despite the broad functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) via the regulation of target genes, little is known about their roles in FSH secretion. Our previous results suggested that miR-186-5p targets the 3′ UTR of &lt;i&gt;FSHb&lt;/i&gt;; therefore, we examined whether miR-186-5p could regulate FSH secretion in rat anterior adenohypophyseal cells. miR-186-5p was transfected into rat anterior pituitary cells. The expression of &lt;i&gt;FSHb&lt;/i&gt; and the secretion of FSH were examined by RT-qPCR and ELISA. A miR-186-5p mimic decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;FSHb&lt;/i&gt; compared with expression in the control group and decreased FSH secretion. In contrast, both the mRNA levels and secretion of FSH increased in response to miR-186-5p inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that miR-186-5p regulates FSH secretion by directly targeting the &lt;i&gt;FSHb&lt;/i&gt; 3′ UTR, providing additional functional evidence for the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of animal reproduction.</content></content><author><name>Dong-Xu Han</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dong-Xu Han, Yue Xiao, Chang-Jiang Wang, Hao Jiang, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and the muscle activation of erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles in a group of pregnant women in the third trimester. The hypothesis was that pregnancy-related biomechanical and morphological changes modify the position of the lumbopelvic region and the activation of extensor muscles. The position of the lumbar spine and pelvis in the sagittal plane, and the EMG activity of the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles, were recorded during standing in 34 nulliparous and 34 pregnant women in the third trimester, and also two months after birth in the group of pregnant women. No significant differences in the position of the lumbar spine or pelvis between the group of pregnant women and nulliparous or postpartum were observed. A significant increase was observed in the EMG activity of the erector spinae (4.6% vs 2.4% and 2.1% in the nulliparous group and postpartum respectively) and the biceps femoris (3.4% vs 1.2% and 1.4%) in pregnant women compared to the other two groups (p &amp;lt;0.01). We conclude that pregnant women in the third trimester show no alterations in lumbopelvic position compared to nulliparous and postpartum women. However, there is an increase of the EMG activity of the trunk extensors. These results indicate that the extensor muscles of the trunk show, in static positions, adaptive responses to the increase of anterior loads during pregnancy.</content></content><author><name>Gemma Biviá-Roig</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gemma Biviá-Roig, Juan Francisco Lisón, Daniel Sánchez-Zuriaga&lt;/p&gt;

Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations.

It also provides a template to validate additional datasets used in developing novel clinical-decision support systems for EVD and other emerging infectious diseases.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f18:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522184400000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</originId><published>1522184400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8a626eb7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;
Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</content></content><author><name>Spyros Makridakis</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

The benefits of CLV persist long after the end of stimulation because connectivity in critical neural circuits has been restored.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Equilibration and analysis of first-principles molecular dynamics simulations of water</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018116?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88e2:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018116?af=R</originId><published>1521694493000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>8a4b2b89</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018116?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>William Dawson</name></author><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>13337</engagement><title>Stephen Hawking (1942–2018)</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02839-9</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162232b6110:83070:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-02839-9/d41586-018-02839-9_15516174.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02839-9</originId><published>1521010800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f3477ac6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02839-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen Hawking (1942–2018)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Hawking (1942–2018), Published online: 14 March 2018;

Novel rutin-loaded zein-sodium caseinate nanoparticles (ZP) with antioxidant activity in aqueous medium were investigated. The results showed that the sodium caseinate concentrations, dosages of rutin and ethanol volume fractions significantly affected the zein nanoparticles’ characteristics.

Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/47MpyGKP0b0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Javier A.

We sought to measure the response of cortisol concentrations around a professional tennis match and its association with hydration status and neuromuscular performance. Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</description><title>Hormonal and neuromuscular responses during a singles match in male professional tennis players</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd072:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4405404f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195242</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Álvaro López-Samanes, Jesús G.

Anti-predator signaling is highly variable with numerous examples of species employing cryptic coloration to avoid detection or conspicuous coloration (often coupled with a secondary defense) to ensure detection and recollection. While the ends of this spectrum are clear in their function, how species use intermediate signals is less clear. Australian Brood Frogs (&lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;) display conspicuous coloration on both their dorsum and venter. Coupled with the alkaloid toxins these frogs possess, this coloration may be aposematic, providing a protective warning signal to predators. We assessed predation rates of known and novel color patterns and found no difference for avian or mammalian predators. However, when &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt; dorsal phenotypes were collectively compared to the high-contrast ventral phenotype of this genus, we found birds, but not mammals, attacked dorsal phenotypes significantly less frequently than the ventral phenotype. This study, importantly, shows a differential predator response to ventral coloration in this genus which has implications for the evolution of conspicuous signaling in &lt;i&gt;Pseudophryne&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><author><name>J.

Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.</content></content><author><name>R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Kazuko Mihara</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;

The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03542-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>662</engagement><title>Biomimetic temporal self-assembly via fuel-driven controlled supramolecular polymerization</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03542-z</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162763b251a:7847070:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03542-z/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3542_Fig2_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>493</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03542-z</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>5165d779</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/5TTZTNrvw3c/s41467-018-03542-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biomimetic temporal self-assembly via fuel-driven controlled supramolecular polymerization&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic temporal self-assembly via fuel-driven controlled supramolecular polymerization, Published online: 30 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03542-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03542-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Modulating the structural and transient characteristics of synthetic nanostructures can be achieved by temporal control of supramolecular assemblies.

Although several studies have demonstrated a potential correlation of dietary patterns with cognitive function, the relationship between tooth loss and dietary patterns and cognitive function have not been identified. In this cross-sectional study, we used a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, a technique used previously to observe dietary patterns based on the intakes of nutrients or levels of biomarkers associated with the condition of interest, to identify tooth loss-related dietary patterns and investigate the associations of such patterns with cognitive impairment in 334 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years. According to Pearson correlation coefficients, the intakes of six nutrients (ash content, sodium, zinc, vitamin B1, α- and β-carotene) correlated significantly with the number of remaining teeth. Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment.

Metagenomics is a powerful tool for characterizing viral composition within environmental samples, but sample and molecular processing steps can bias the estimation of viral community structure. The objective of this study is to understand the inherent variability introduced when conducting viral metagenomic analyses of wastewater and provide a bioinformatic strategy to accurately analyze sequences for viral community analyses. A standard approach using a combination of ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, and DNase treatment, and multiple displacement amplification (MDA) produced DNA preparations without any bacterial derived genes. Results showed recoveries in wastewater matrix ranged between 60–100%. A bias towards small single stranded DNA (ssDNA; polyomavirus) virus types vs larger double stranded DNA (dsDNA; adenovirus) viruses was also observed with a total estimated recovery of small circular viruses to be as much as 173-fold higher. Notably, ssDNA abundance decreased with sample dilution while large dsDNA genomes (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Caudovirales&lt;/i&gt;) initially increased in abundance with dilution before gradually decreasing with further dilution in wastewater samples. The present study revealed the inherent biases associated with different components of viral metagenomic methods applied to wastewater. Overall, these results provide a well-characterized approach for effectively conducting viral metagenomics analysis of wastewater and reveal that dilution can effectively mitigate MDA bias.</content></content><author><name>Nichole E.

The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed differential methylation analysis and compared between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values (β-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo- (β-value &amp;lt; 0.3) or hypermethylated (β-value &gt; 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected a significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 EPIC probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with ~80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.</content></content><author><name>Hemant Gujar</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Gujar, Jane W.

However, for this small subset the array provides a reliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.</description></item><item><engagement>84</engagement><title>The undercover academic keeping tabs on ‘﻿predatory’ publishing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1622ea1b6aa:1232c9d:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-02921-2/d41586-018-02921-2_15522256.png</url><width>630</width><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>380</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2</originId><published>1521183600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d471cca2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The undercover academic keeping tabs on ‘﻿predatory’ publishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undercover academic keeping tabs on ‘﻿predatory’ publishing, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02921-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Blacklists that warn against questionable publishers are in demand.</content></content><author><name>Dalmeet Singh Chawla</name></author><crawled>1521200772778</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The undercover academic keeping tabs on ‘﻿predatory’ publishing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undercover academic keeping tabs on ‘﻿predatory’ publishing, Published online: 16 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-02921-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Blacklists that warn against questionable publishers are in demand.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Epidemiological and histological findings implicate matrix Gla protein in diastolic left ventricular dysfunction</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193967</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a79:7c9981b6</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193967</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193967</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>890bf896</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193967</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fang-Fei Wei, Sander Trenson, Pierre Monney, Wen-Yi Yang, Menno Pruijm, Zhen-Yu Zhang, Yassine Bouatou, Qi-Fang Huang, Belen Ponte, Pierre-Yves Martin, Lutgarde Thijs, Tatiana Kuznetsova, Karel Allegaert, Stefan Janssens, Cees Vermeer, Peter Verhamme, Michel Burnier, Murielle Bochud, Georg Ehret, Jan A.

Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</content></content><author><name>Marta Miragall</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;

The assessment of competitive movement demands in team sports has traditionally relied upon global positioning system (GPS) analyses presented as fixed-time epochs (e.g., 5–40 min). More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</content></content><author><name>Daniel J.

More recently, presenting game data as a rolling average has become prevalent due to concerns over a loss of sampling resolution associated with the windowing of data over fixed periods. Accordingly, this study compared rolling average (ROLL) and fixed-time (FIXED) epochs for quantifying the peak movement demands of international rugby union match-play as a function of playing position. Elite players from three different squads (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 119) were monitored using 10 Hz GPS during 36 matches played in the 2014–2017 seasons. Players categorised broadly as forwards and backs, and then by positional sub-group (FR: front row, SR: second row, BR: back row, HB: half back, MF: midfield, B3: back three) were monitored during match-play for peak values of high-speed running (&gt;5 m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; HSR) and relative distance covered (m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) over 60–300 s using two types of sample-epoch (ROLL, FIXED). Irrespective of the method used, as the epoch length increased, values for the intensity of running actions decreased (e.g., For the backs using the ROLL method, distance covered decreased from 177.4 ± 20.6 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in the 60 s epoch to 107.5 ± 13.3 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the 300 s epoch). For the team as a whole, and irrespective of position, estimates of fixed effects indicated significant between-method differences across all time-points for both relative distance covered and HSR. Movement demands were underestimated consistently by FIXED versus ROLL with differences being most pronounced using 60 s epochs (95% CI HSR: -6.05 to -4.70 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 95% CI distance: -18.45 to -16.43 m·min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). For all HSR time epochs except one, all backs groups increased more (p &amp;lt; 0.01) from FIXED to ROLL than the forward groups. Linear mixed modelling of ROLL data highlighted that for HSR (except 60 s epoch), SR was the only group not significantly different to FR. For relative distance covered all other position groups were greater than the FR (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The FIXED method underestimated both relative distance (~11%) and HSR values (up to ~20%) compared to the ROLL method. These differences were exaggerated for the HSR variable in the backs position who covered the greatest HSR distance; highlighting important consideration for those implementing the FIXED method of analysis. The data provides coaches with a worst-case scenario reference on the running demands required for periods of 60–300 s in length. This information offers novel insight into game demands and can be used to inform the design of training games to increase specificity of preparation for the most demanding phases of matches.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00172</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Unique Fluorescent Imaging Probe for Bacterial Surface Localization and Resistant Enzyme Imaging</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00172</link><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_16291730649:ade11:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00172/20180404/images/medium/cb-2018-00172z_0008.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>418</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00172</originId><crawled>1522858657353</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId></origin><fingerprint>df759604</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00172/20180404/images/medium/cb-2018-00172z_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00172&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The annual return of beluga whales, &lt;i&gt;Delphinapterus leucas&lt;/i&gt;, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (&lt;i&gt;Φ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11–0.32, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0–0.02; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions. Assignment tests identified few immigrants within summering aggregations, linked migrating groups to specific summering areas, and found that some migratory corridors comprise whales from multiple subpopulations (P&lt;sub&gt;BAYES&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.31:0.69). Further, dispersal is male-biased and substantial numbers of closely related whales congregate together at coastal summering areas. Stable patterns of heterogeneity between areas and consistently high proportions (~20%) of close kin (including parent-offspring) sampled up to 20 years apart within areas (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.5) is the first direct evidence of natal philopatry to migration destinations in belugas.

Identity-based proxy re-signature (IDPRS) is a novel cryptographic primitive that allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a signature under one identity into another signature under another identity on the same message by using a re-signature key. Due to this transformation function, IDPRS is very useful in constructing privacy-preserving schemes for various information systems. Key revocation functionality is important in practical IDPRS for managing users dynamically; however, the existing IDPRS schemes do not provide revocation mechanisms that allow the removal of misbehaving or compromised users from the system. In this paper, we first introduce a notion called revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (RIDPRS) to achieve the revocation functionality. We provide a formal definition of RIDPRS as well as its security model. Then, we present a concrete RIDPRS scheme that can resist signing key exposure and prove that the proposed scheme is existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen identity and message attacks in the standard model. To further improve the performance of signature verification in RIDPRS, we introduce a notion called server-aided revocable identity-based proxy re-signature (SA-RIDPRS). Moreover, we extend the proposed RIDPRS scheme to the SA-RIDPRS scheme and prove that this extended scheme is secure against adaptive chosen message and collusion attacks. The analysis results show that our two schemes remain efficient in terms of computational complexity when implementing user revocation procedures. In particular, in the SA-RIDPRS scheme, the verifier needs to perform only a bilinear pairing and four exponentiation operations to verify the validity of the signature.

In the field of the social psychology of prejudice, John Duckitt&apos;s Dual-Process Cognitive-Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice has gained a firm grounding over the past decade and a half, while empathy has become one of the most powerful predictors of prejudice, alongside right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates.

This study integrates empathy into the dual-process model, exploring the effects of this variable, along with the impact of personality and ideological attitudes, on prejudice in both its blatant and subtle forms. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect data from 260 university students by self-report measures. Despite its cross-sectional nature, a pattern of causal relationships was hypothesized according to experimental and longitudinal findings from previous studies. The path analysis results show that in the model fitted to the data, empathy does not have any direct impact on prejudice, although it plays a significant role in the prediction of prejudice towards a particular immigrant group. On the other hand, the dual-process model is confirmed in the explanation of blatant prejudice and, in a weaker and indirect way, of subtle prejudice; sustaining the distinctive nature of these constructs on some differential predictors and paths. In the discussion, this study proposes that when ideological and personality-based variables are both included in the model, general empathy is not so robust in the explanation of prejudice, since some of the empathetic components might become diluted among other covariates. But even so, its indirect effectiveness through personality and ideological attitudes remains relevant.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>&quot;Letting myself go forward past wrongs&quot;: How regulatory modes affect self-forgiveness</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193357</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1621b4b57ed:64b3a65:7c9981b6</id><updated>1520888400000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193357</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193357</originId><published>1520888400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>21745971</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193357</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pierro, Gennaro Pica, Anna Maria Giannini, E.

The present research addresses the question of whether regulatory-mode orientations affect self-forgiveness. We expected that people with a strong locomotion orientation would be more inclined to self-forgiveness because of their tendencies toward movement and change, which focus them on the future, whereas people with a strong assessment orientation would refrain from self-forgiveness due to their evaluative tendencies which focus them on the past. These hypotheses were supported by the results in four studies that tested the relation between regulatory modes and self-forgiveness by measuring (Studies 1, 3 and 4) and manipulating (Study 2) regulatory-mode-orientations. Finally, in Study 4 we examined more closely our hypothesis that the relation between self-forgiveness and regulatory modes is mediated by past and future temporal foci. The implications of the results for regulatory mode theory are also discussed.</content></content><author><name>Antonio Pierro</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Pierro, Gennaro Pica, Anna Maria Giannini, E.

&lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, due to its short lipooligosaccharide structure, is generally more sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of some fatty acids than most other Gram negative bacteria. This supports recent development of a fatty acid-based potential treatment for gonococcal infections, particularly ophthalmia neonatorum. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; genome contains genes for fatty acid resistance. In this study, the potential for genomic mutations that could lead to resistance to this potential new treatment were investigated. &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; strain NCCP11945 was repeatedly passaged on growth media containing a sub-lethal concentration of fatty acid myristic acid and monoglyceride monocaprin. Cultures were re-sequenced and assessed for changes in minimum inhibitory concentration. Of note, monocaprin grown cultures developed a mutation in transcription factor gene &lt;i&gt;dksA&lt;/i&gt;, which suppresses molecular chaperone DnaK and may be involved in the stress response. The minimum inhibitory concentration after exposure to monocaprin showed a modest two-fold change. The results of this study suggest that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; cannot readily evolve resistance that will impact treatment of ophthalmia neonatorum with monocaprin.</content></content><author><name>Colin P.

Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease. We conducted a scoping review of child growth studies in which length/height, weight or body mass index (BMI) was measured at ≥ 2 time points. From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.</content></content><author><name>Michael Leung</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Leung, Nandita Perumal, Elnathan Mesfin, Aditi Krishna, Seungmi Yang, William Johnson, Diego G.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world. Although optimal medical care and treatment is widely available, the prognosis of patients with HF is still poor.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important compartments of the innate immunity. Current studies have identified TLRs as critical mediators in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of TLRs and interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) in different experimental HF models including viral myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac hypertrophy. In addition, we investigated for the first time comprehensive TLR and IRF gene and protein expression under basal conditions in murine and human cardiac tissue. We found that &lt;i&gt;Tlr4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed highest gene expression under basal conditions, indicating their significant role in first-line defense in the murine and human heart. Moreover, induction of TLRs and IRFs clearly differs between the various experimental HF models of diverse etiology and the concomitant inflammatory status. In the HF model of acute viral-induced myocarditis, TLR and IRF activation displayed the uppermost gene expression in comparison to the remaining experimental HF models, indicating the highest amount of myocardial inflammation in myocarditis. In detail, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; displayed by far the highest gene expression during acute viral infection. Interestingly, post myocardial infarction TLR and IRF gene expression was almost exclusively increased in the infarct zone after myocardial ischemia (&lt;i&gt;Tlr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr6&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tlr9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt;). With one exception, &lt;i&gt;Irf3&lt;/i&gt; showed a decreased gene expression in the remote zone post infarction. Finally, we identified &lt;i&gt;Irf7&lt;/i&gt; as novel cardiovascular stress-inducible factor in the pathologically stressed heart. These findings on TLR and IRF function in the inflamed heart highlight the complexity of inflammatory immune response and raise more interesting questions for future investigation.</content></content><author><name>Peter Moritz Becher</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Moritz Becher, Svenja Hinrichs, Nina Fluschnik, Jan K.

Chemistry researchers are frequently evaluated on the perceived significance of their work with the citation count as the most commonly-used metric for gauging this property. Recent studies have called for a broader evaluation of significance that includes more nuanced bibliometrics as well as altmetrics to more completely evaluate scientific research. To better understand the relationship between metrics and peer judgements of significance in chemistry, we have conducted a survey of chemists to investigate their perceptions of previously published research. Focusing on a specific issue of the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; published in 2003, respondents were asked to select which articles they thought best matched importance and significance given several contexts: highest number of citations, most significant (subjectively defined), most likely to share among chemists, and most likely to share with a broader audience. The answers to the survey can be summed up in several observations. The ability of respondents to predict the citation counts of established research is markedly lower than the ability of those counts to be predicted by the h-index of the corresponding author of each article. This observation is conserved even when only considering responses from chemists whose expertise falls within the subdiscipline that best describes the work performed in an article. Respondents view both cited papers and significant papers differently than papers that should be shared with chemists. We conclude from our results that peer judgements of importance and significance differ from metrics-based measurements, and that chemists should work with bibliometricians to develop metrics that better capture the nuance of opinions on the importance of a given piece of research.</content></content><author><name>Rachel Borchardt</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel Borchardt, Cullen Moran, Stuart Cantrill, Chemjobber, See Arr Oh, Matthew R.

Aim &lt;p&gt;Warfarin is a cornerstone for the prevention of thromboembolism in atrial fibrillation (AF), and several efforts have been taken to increase its usage and safety, including risk stratification schemes. Our aim was to investigate the temporal trends in initiation of warfarin and its effects on incidence of bleeding and thromboembolism in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation 1996–2011.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;All patients with a first-time diagnosis of non-valvular atrial fibrillation were identified from nationwide administrative registries. Trends were determined by linear regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total 153,682 patients were included. Initiation of warfarin increased from 14% to 41% (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Events of thromboembolism decreased from 3.9% to 2.6% annually (p&amp;lt;0.0001).

This study aimed to determine the effect of metabolic syndrome (MS) on the reproductive function in fertile (FM) and male partners of infertile couples (MPIC). We performed a cross-sectional study formatting two study groups: partners of pregnant women (n = 238; mean age 32.0) as FM and male partners of infertile couples (n = 2642; mean age 32.6) as MPIC. A standard semen analysis was performed and clinical, laboratory and lifestyle data were analysed. The adapted NCEP-ATPIII criteria were used to define MS. 12.2% of FM and 17.8% of MPIC had MS. In both groups, men with MS were older, they were centrally obese and had higher triglycerides, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and decreased HDL cholesterol values as compared to men without MS. However, glucose concentrations as well as fasting insulin levels were significantly higher only in the MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; group. MS was not associated with semen parameters. Testosterone levels were negatively correlated to MS in both groups. This negative association persisted within the BMI categories between MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and MPIC-MS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; groups. LH was negatively correlated to MS but only in MPIC. FSH and oestradiol were not correlated to MS. Smoking and alcohol consumption were higher among men with MS. This study shows that except for testosterone, MS has no independent effect on major fertility parameters in different subgroups of men.</content></content><author><name>Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev</name></author><crawled>1521255609657</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kristel Ehala-Aleksejev, Margus Punab&lt;/p&gt;

Rapid repair of vascular injury is an important prognostic factor for electrical burns. This repair is achieved mainly via stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α promoting the mobilization, chemotaxis, homing, and targeted differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into endothelial cells. Forming a concentration gradient from the site of local damage in the circulation is essential to the role of SDF-1α. In a previous study, we developed reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive PPADT nanoparticles containing SDF-1α that could degrade in response to high concentration of ROS in tissue lesions, achieving the goal of targeted SDF-1α release. In the current study, a rat vascular injury model of electrical burns was used to evaluate the effects of targeted release of SDF-1α using PPADT nanoparticles on the chemotaxis of BMSCs and the repair of vascular injury. Continuous exposure to 220 V for 6 s could damage rat vascular endothelial cells, strip off the inner layer, significantly elevate the local level of ROS, and decrease the level of SDF-1α. After injection of Cy5-labeled SDF-1α-PPADT nanoparticles, the distribution of Cy5 fluorescence suggested that SDF-1α was distributed primarily at the injury site, and the local SDF-1α levels increased significantly. Seven days after injury with nanoparticles injection, aggregation of exogenous green fluorescent protein-labeled BMSCs at the injury site was observed. Ten days after injury, the endothelial cell arrangement was better organized and continuous, with relatively intact vascular morphology and more blood vessels. These results showed that SDF-1α-PPADT nanoparticles targeted the SDF-1α release at the site of injury, directing BMSC chemotaxis and homing, thereby promoting vascular repair in response to electrical burns.</content></content><author><name>Fang He</name></author><crawled>1520877426683</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fang He, Peng-Fei Luo, Tao Tang, Fang Zhang, He Fang, Shi-Zhao Ji, Yu Sun, Guo-Sheng Wu, Bo-Han Pan, Zhi-Bao Huo, Guang-Yi Wang, Zhao-Fan Xia&lt;/p&gt;

While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33285</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>dbautista@berkeley.edu (Benjamin U Hoffman)</name></author><published>1521590400000</published><description>Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception.

Violent acts on university campuses are becoming more frequent. Enrollment rates of Latinos at universities is increasing. Research has indicated that youths are more susceptible to trauma, particularly Latinos. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate the validity of commonly used posttraumatic stress measures among Latino college students. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) is one of the most commonly used metrics of posttraumatic stress disorder symptomatology. However, it is largely unknown if the IES-R is measuring the same construct across different sub-samples (e.g. Latino versus non-Latino). The current study aimed to assess measurement invariance for the IES-R between Latino and non-Latino participants. A total of 545 participants completed the IES-R. One- and three-factor scoring solutions were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance was then evaluated by estimating several multiple-group confirmatory factor analytic models. Four models with an increasing degree of invariance across groups were compared. A significant χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; difference test was used to indicate a significant change in model fit between nested models within the measurement invariance testing process. The three-factor scoring solution could not be used for the measurement invariance process because the subscale correlations were too high for estimation (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;s 0.92–1.00). Therefore, the one-factor model was used for the invariance testing process. Invariance was met for each level of invariance: configural, metric, scalar, and strict. All measurement invariance testing results indicated that the one-factor solution for the IES-R was equivalent for the Latino and non-Latino participants.</content></content><author><name>Jitske Tiemensma</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jitske Tiemensma, Sarah Depaoli, Sonja D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Pediatric patients, especially in the preverbal stage, cannot self-report intensity of pain therefore several validated observational tools, including the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Behavioral Scale, have been used as a benchmark to evaluate pediatric pain.

Seizure clustering is a common and significant phenomenon in patients with epilepsy. The clustering of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) in animal models of epilepsy, including mouse pilocarpine models, has been reported. However, most studies have analyzed seizures for a short duration after the induction of status epilepticus (SE). In this study, we investigated the detailed characteristics of seizure clustering in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model for an extended duration by continuous 24/7 video-EEG monitoring. A seizure cluster was defined as the occurrence of one or more seizures per day for at least three consecutive days and at least five seizures during the cluster period. We analyzed the cluster duration, seizure-free period, cluster interval, and numbers of seizures within and outside the seizure clusters. The video-EEG monitoring began 84.5±33.7 days after the induction of SE and continued for 53.7±20.4 days. Every mouse displayed seizure clusters, and 97.0% of the seizures occurred within a cluster period. The seizure clusters were followed by long seizure-free periods of 16.3±6.8 days, showing a cyclic pattern. The SRSs also occurred in a grouped pattern within a day. We demonstrate that almost all seizures occur in clusters with a cyclic pattern in the chronic stage of a mouse pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. The seizure-free periods between clusters were long. These findings should be considered when performing &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies using this animal model. Furthermore, this model might be appropriate for studying the unrevealed mechanism of ictogenesis.</content></content><author><name>Jung-Ah Lim</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jung-Ah Lim, Jangsup Moon, Tae-Joon Kim, Jin-Sun Jun, Byeongsu Park, Jung-Ick Byun, Jun-Sang Sunwoo, Kyung-Il Park, Soon-Tae Lee, Keun-Hwa Jung, Ki-Young Jung, Manho Kim, Daejong Jeon, Kon Chu, Sang Kun Lee&lt;/p&gt;

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Shiva Farashahi</name></author><crawled>1522172570172</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shiva Farashahi, Chih-Chung Ting, Chang-Hao Kao, Shih-Wei Wu, Alireza Soltani&lt;/p&gt;
When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005249</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>7</engagement><title>Science-based taxonomy still needs better governance: Response to Thomson et al.</title><recrawled>1521053823081</recrawled><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005249</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162259eed6a:493922:bdf8aaf1</id><updated>1521061200000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005249</originId><published>1521061200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>cb45284d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/x4Ku0kArfCg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Thomas Garnett, Les Christidis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x4Ku0kArfCg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Stephen Thomas Garnett</name></author><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephen Thomas Garnett, Les Christidis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x4Ku0kArfCg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Patients with atrial fibrillation and permanent pacemaker: Temporal changes in patient characteristics and pharmacotherapy</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca425c:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1522270800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</originId><published>1522270800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b6d29348</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195175</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frederik Dalgaard, Martin H.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing.

Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Col2a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dcx&lt;/i&gt; at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum. Therefore, we propose that this physiological phenomenon represents a proof-of-concept model for investigating the mechanisms involved in cartilage restoration in adult animals.</content></content><author><name>Bianca Gazieri Castelucci</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Gazieri Castelucci, Sílvio Roberto Consonni, Viviane Souza Rosa, Lucimara Aparecida Sensiate, Paula Cristina Rugno Delatti, Lúcia Elvira Alvares, Paulo Pinto Joazeiro&lt;/p&gt;

Rotavirus is a common cause of diarrhea worldwide, and vaccination prevents rotaviral gastroenteritis. Since the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in Korea in 2007, the prevalence of rotaviral gastroenteritis has decreased. However, little is known on the economic burden of rotavirus infection and its variations in Korea. Here, we estimated the economic costs of rotavirus infection from 2009 to 2012 using nationwide data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) claims. Socioeconomic costs were subdivided into direct and indirect and measured with a prevalence-based approach. Costs were converted from Won to United States dollars (US$). The number of children &amp;lt;5years old infected with rotavirus decreased from 21,437 to 10,295 during the study period, representing a decrease in prevalence from 947 to 443 per 100,000. The sum of direct and indirect costs also decreased, from $17.3 million to $9.6 million, and the days of admission decreased from 76,000 to 38,000. However, per capita expenditures slightly increased, from $809 to $934. Thus, the economic burden of rotavirus infection decreased after implementation of rotavirus vaccination.

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</content></content><author><name>Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski, Hugh S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Statins have been known to increase the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, other factors, especially hypertension, are also associated with DM development.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated whether statin use increases the risk of DM and further analyzed whether the relation between statin use and incident DM differs according to the presence of hypertension and gender.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From a nationwide health-screening cohort, 40,164 participants with total cholesterol levels ≥eve mg/dL and without pre-diagnosed DM, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, who underwent a series of regular health check-ups, were enrolled. Statin users were defined as participants who were prescribed statins more than twice during 6 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 17,798 statin non-users and 22,366 statin users. During 7.66±3.21 years of follow-up, incident DM developed in 5.68% of statin non-users and 7.64% of statin users. Among the entire study population, statin use was associated with new-onset DM after adjusting for clinical risk factors. In sub-analysis according to hypertension, statin use significantly increased the risk of incident DM only in normotensive patients [hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09 to 1.58, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004], and not in hypertensive patients (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05).

However, in men, statin was associated with new-onset DM only in normotensive males (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.92, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and not in hypertensive males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Statin use increased the risk of new-onset DM only in normotensive patients and hypertensive women, suggesting that these groups should be more carefully monitored for the development of DM during the course of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Morphological and Physicochemical Evaluation of Two Distinct Glibenclamide/Hypromellose Amorphous Nanoparticles Prepared by the Antisolvent Method</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_1621cb19296:fd941:a077e55f</id><recrawled>1521571526502</recrawled><unread>False</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122</originId><crawled>1520899822230</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122/20180312/images/medium/mp-2017-011222_0011.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>198</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>c2b1e51b</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122/20180312/images/medium/mp-2017-011222_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01122&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Our present frequently resembles our past. Patterns of actions and events repeat throughout our lives like a motif. Identifying and exploiting these patterns are fundamental to many behaviours, from creating grammar to the application of skill across diverse situations. Such generalization may be dependent upon memory instability. Following their formation, memories are unstable and able to interact with one another, allowing, at least in principle, common features to be extracted. Exploiting these common features creates generalized knowledge that can be applied across varied circumstances.

Background &lt;p&gt;Dietary diversity scores (DDS) are considered as metrics for monitoring the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, but they need to be rigorously evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine two DDS, the Food Groups Index (FGI), and the Minimum Dietary Diversity-Women (MDD-W), alongside two dietary quality scores, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-2010) and the Prime Diet Quality Score (PDQS), with risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;The analysis included 21,312 (GDM) and 19,917 (HDPs) singleton births reported in the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort (1991–2001), among women without major chronic disease or GDM/HDPs. Scores were derived using prepregnancy diet collected by a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable models were utilized to calculate relative risks (RR) and confidence intervals (95%CIs).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Incident GDM (n = 916) and HDPs (n = 1,421) were reported. The MDD-W and FGI were not associated with risk of GDM or HDPs, but the AHEI-2010 and PDQS were associated with a lower risk of GDM and marginally lower risk of HDP. The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Selma Gicevic</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Selma Gicevic, Audrey J.

The RR’s of GDM comparing the highest vs. lowest quintiles were 1.00 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.27; p-trend = 0.82) for MDD-W, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.22; p-trend = 0.88) for FGI, 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.81; p-trend &amp;lt;0.0001) for the AHEI-2010 and 0.68 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.86; p-trend = 0.003) for the PDQS. Similarly, the RR’s of HDPs were 0.92 (95%CI: 0.75, 1.12, p-trend = 0.94) for MDD-W, 0.97 (95%CI: 0.79, 1.17; p-trend = 0.83) for FGI, 0.84 (95%CI: 0.70, 1.02; p-trend = 0.07) for AHEI-2010 and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.09; p-trend = 0.07) for PDQS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MDD-W and FGI did not predict the risk of GDM and HDPs. These DDS should not be widely used as metrics for achieving dietary goals in their present form. The Prime Diet Quality Score warrants further testing as a promising measure of a sustainable and healthy diet on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Clinical value of patient-specific three-dimensional printing of congenital heart disease: Quantitative and qualitative assessments</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e5:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1521666000000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</originId><published>1521666000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>2e27b850</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis. Here we report that the human FBP1 gene is regulated by two liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. C/EBPα regulates transcription of FBP1 gene via binding to the two overlapping C/EBPα sites located at nucleotide -228/-208 while HNF4α regulates FBP1 gene through binding to the classical H4-SBM site and direct repeat 3 (DR3) located at nucleotides -566/-554 and -212/-198, respectively. Mutations of these transcription factor binding sites result in marked decrease of C/EBPα- or HNF4α-mediated transcription activation of FBP1 promoter-luciferase reporter expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of -228/-208 C/EBPα or -566/-554 and -212/-198 HNF4α sites with nuclear extract of HepG2 cells overexpressing C/EBPα or HNF4α confirms binding of these two transcription factors to these sites. Finally, we showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of C/EBPα or HNF4α expression in HepG2 cells lowers expression of FBP1 in parallel with down-regulation of expression of other gluconeogenic enzymes. Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.</content></content><author><name>Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn, Pinnara Rojvirat, Tanit Chavalit, Michael J.

These practices imply notable changes in how individuals and groups related to the landscape and to one another and provide documentation relevant to human social and cognitive evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>76</engagement><title>UK survey reveals widespread sexual misconduct by academic staff</title><engagementRate>0.46</engagementRate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162aac34500:1580177:923c4a60</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04212-2</originId><published>1523257200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04212-2</link><fingerprint>d5d1e323</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04212-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK survey reveals widespread sexual misconduct by academic staff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK survey reveals widespread sexual misconduct by academic staff, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04212-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04212-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;One in four respondents to a national survey said they had been sexually harassed by staff, but few students reported the incidents.</content></content><author><name>Nisha Gaind</name></author><crawled>1523283346688</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UK survey reveals widespread sexual misconduct by academic staff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK survey reveals widespread sexual misconduct by academic staff, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04212-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04212-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;One in four respondents to a national survey said they had been sexually harassed by staff, but few students reported the incidents.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>B7-H1 maintains the polyclonal T cell response by protecting dendritic cells from cytotoxic T lymphocyte destruction [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6ae:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/12.cover-source.jpg?itok=TO5q5WLS</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>ce5f50a6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Induced B7-H1 expression in the tumor microenvironment initiates adaptive resistance, which impairs immune functions and leads to tumor escape from immune destruction.

Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret. Methods: Here, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with phenotypes. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results. Results: We validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature. Conclusion: Our novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These products could be further evaluated either as stand-alone vaccine candidate, or used in a prime-and-boost regimen with other forms of ZIKV vaccine.</content></content><author><name>Huabin Liang</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huabin Liang, Ruoheng Yang, Zhihua Liu, Min Li, Haitao Liu, Xia Jin&lt;/p&gt;

The high risk of experiencing domestic violence (DV) among married women in India who reside in slum communities underscores the need for effective, evidence-based, and culturally-tailored primary prevention. To inform such DV primary prevention strategies for this population, we herein aimed to identify correlates of DV experience in early marriage. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, potential correlates of DV experience were explored among a geographically-clustered random sample of 100 recently-married women residing in slums in Pune, India. In multivariable regression, DV experience was associated with less educational attainment by the participant’s spouse (standardized β = -0.281, p = 0.004), less satisfaction of the spouse’s family with the &lt;i&gt;maanpaan&lt;/i&gt; (wedding-related gifts provided by the bride’s family) they received at the time of marriage (standardized β = -0.298, p&amp;lt;0.001), poorer conflict negotiation skills (standardized β = -0.308, p&amp;lt;0.001), and greater acknowledgement of DV occurrence in family and friends (standardized β = 0.436, p&amp;lt;0.001). These correlates suggest strategies that could be incorporated into future DV primary prevention interventions for this vulnerable population (i.e. promoting completion of formal education of boys alongside girls, mitigating causes of familial dowry harassment, improving conflict negotiation skills, and challenging norms surrounding DV).</content></content><author><name>Ameeta S.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV is vulnerable to unplanned treatment interruptions–consecutively missed doses over a series of days–which can result in virologic rebound. Yet clinicians lack a simple, valid method for estimating the risk of interruptions. If the likelihood of ART interruption could be derived from a convenient-to-gather summary measure of medication adherence, it might be a valuable tool for both clinical decision-making and research. We constructed an &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; probability model of ART interruption based on average adherence and tested its predictions using data collected on 185 HIV-infected, treatment-naïve individuals over the first 90 days of ART in a prospective cohort study in Mbarara, Uganda. The outcome of interest was the presence or absence of a treatment gap, defined as &gt;72 hours without a dose. Using the pre-determined value of 0.50 probability as the cut point for predicting an interruption, the classification accuracy of the model was 73% (95% CI = 66%– 79%), the specificity was 87% (95% CI = 79%– 93%), and the sensitivity was 59% (95% CI = 48%– 69%). Overall model performance was satisfactory, with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.80–0.91) and Brier score of 0.20. The study serves as proof-of-concept that the probability model can accurately differentiate patients on the continuum of risk for short-term ART interruptions using a summary measure of adherence. The model may also aid in the design of targeted interventions.</content></content><author><name>Rebecca Arden Harris</name></author><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca Arden Harris, Jessica E.

The natural alkaloid berberine has been ascribed numerous health benefits including lipid and cholesterol reduction and improved insulin sensitivity in diabetics. However, oral (PO) administration of berberine is hindered by poor bioavailability and increasing dose often elicits gastro-intestinal side effects. To overcome the caveats associated with oral berberine, we developed transdermal (TD) formulations of berberine (BBR) and the berberine precursor dihydroberberine (DHB). These formulations were compared to oral BBR using pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and general safety studies &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To complete this work, a sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated according the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods to simultaneously measure berberine, simvastatin, and simvastatin hydroxy acid with relative quantification used for the berberine metabolite demethylene berberine glucuronide (DBG). Acute pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated a statistically relevant ranking for berberine bioavailability based upon AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-8&lt;/sub&gt; as DHB TD &gt; BBR TD &gt;&gt; BBR PO with similar ranking for the metabolite DBG, indicating that transdermal administration achieves BBR levels well above oral administration. Similarly, chronic administration (14 days) resulted in significantly higher levels of circulating BBR and DBG in DHB TD treated animals. Chronically treated rats were given a single dose of simvastatin with no observed change in the drugs bioavailability compared with control, suggesting the increased presence of BBR had no effect on simvastatin metabolism. This observation was further supported by consistent CYP3A4 expression across all treatment groups. Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</content></content><author><name>Beth Buchanan</name></author><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beth Buchanan, Qingfang Meng, Mathieu-Marc Poulin, Jonathan Zuccolo, Chike Godwin Azike, Joseph Gabriele, David Charles Baranowski&lt;/p&gt;

Moreover, no changes in kidney and liver biomarkers, including alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, were observed between treatment formats, and confirming previous reports that BBR has no effect on HMG-CoA expression. This study supports the safe use of transdermal compositions that improve on the poor bioavailability of oral berberine and have the potential to be more efficacious in the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypercholesterolemia.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Expanded cellular clones carrying replication-competent HIV-1 persist, wax, and wane [Immunology and Inflammation]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2575.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1622099e6cb:661325:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2575</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2575.short?rss=1</originId><published>1520961998000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>18cf61dd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2575.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The latent reservoir for HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to cure.

Diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, &lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&lt;/i&gt; were fed high-protein, phosphorus-rich diets (56–60% protein; ca 18g phosphorus kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; diet) whilst being reared at low temperature from start-feeding until parr-smolt transformation. Performances of salmon fed diets based on fish meal (STD) or a mix of fishmeal and hydrolysed fish proteins (HFM) as the major protein sources were compared in terms of mortality, diet digestibility, growth and skeletal deformities. Separate groups of diploids and triploids were reared in triplicate tanks (initially 3000 fish per tank; tank biomass ca. 620 g) from 0–2745 degree-days post-start feeding (ddPSF). Growth metrics (weight, length, condition factor) were recorded at ca. 4 week intervals, external signs of deformities to the operculum, jaws and spinal column were examined in parr sampled at 1390 ddPSF, and external signs of deformity and vertebral anomalies (by radiography) were examined in fish sampled at the end of the trial (2745 ddPSF). The triploid salmon generally had a lower mass per unit length, i.e. lower condition factor, throughout the trial, but this did not seem to reflect any consistent dietary or ploidy effects on either dietary digestibility or the growth of the fish. By the end of the trial fish in all treatment groups had achieved a weight of 50+ g, and had completed the parr-smolt transformation. The triploids had slightly, but significantly, fewer vertebrae (Triploids STD 58.74 ± 0.10; HFM 58.68 ± 0.05) than the diploids (Diploids STD 58.97 ± 0.14; HFM 58.89 ± 0.01), and the incidence of skeletal (vertebral) abnormalities was higher in triploids (Triploids STD 31 ± 0.90%; HFM 15 ± 1.44%) than in diploids (Diploids STD 4 ± 0.80%; HFM 4 ± 0.83%). The HFM diet gave a significant reduction in the numbers of triploid salmon with vertebral anomalies in comparison with the triploids fed the STD diet possibly as a result of differences in phosphorus bioavailability between the two diets. Overall, the incidence of skeletal deformities was lower than reported in previous studies (Diploids 20+%, Triploids 40+%), possibly as a result of the combination of rearing at low-temperature and phosphorus-rich diets being used in the present study.</content></content><author><name>Stefano Peruzzi</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefano Peruzzi, Velmurugu Puvanendran, Guido Riesen, Rudi Ripman Seim, Ørjan Hagen, Silvia Martínez-Llorens, Inger-Britt Falk-Petersen, Jorge M.

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats. Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</description><title>Chemically defined, ultrasoft PDMS elastomers with selectable elasticity for mechanobiology</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195180</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd06e:7c9981b6</id><updated>1523048400000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195180</originId><published>1523048400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>d866c0e8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195180</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktor Heinrichs, Sabine Dieluweit, Jörg Stellbrink, Wim Pyckhout-Hintzen, Nils Hersch, Dieter Richter, Rudolf Merkel&lt;/p&gt;

Even after several days of cultivation no adverse effects were found.</content></content><author><name>Viktor Heinrichs</name></author><crawled>1523036346876</crawled></item><item><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew Gibbs, Kristin Dunkle, Laura Washington, Samantha Willan, Nwabisa Shai, Rachel Jewkes&lt;/p&gt;
Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator of ecosystem functioning but how ecosystem WUE responds to climate change including precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition increases is still unknown. To investigate such responses, an experiment with a randomized block design with water (spring snowfall or summer water addition) and nitrogen addition was conducted in a temperate steppe of northern China. We investigated net ecosystem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (NEP), gross ecosystem production (GEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) to calculate ecosystem WUE (WUEnep = NEP/ET or WUEgep = GEP/ET) under spring snow and summer water addition with or without N addition from 2011 to 2013. The results showed that spring snow addition only had significant effect on ecosystem WUE in 2013 and summer water addition showed positive effect on ecosystem WUE in 2011 and 2013, as their effects on NEP and GEP is stronger than ET. N addition increased ecosystem WUE in 2012 and 2013 both in spring snow addition and summer water addition for its increasing effects on NEP and GEP but no effect on ET. Summer water addition had less but N addition had greater increasing effects on ecosystem WUE as natural precipitation increase indicating that natural precipitation regulates ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition. Moreover, WUE was tightly related with atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), precipitation and soil moisture indicating the regulation of climate drivers on ecosystem WUE. In addition, it also was affected by aboveground net primary production (ANPP). The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</content></content><author><name>Xiaolin Zhang</name></author><crawled>1520877426683</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaolin Zhang, Penghui Zhai, Jianhui Huang, Xiang Zhao, Kuanhu Dong&lt;/p&gt;

The study suggests that ecosystem WUE responses to water and N addition is determined by the change in carbon process rather than that in water process, which are regulated by climate change in the temperate steppe of northern China.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>A psoriasis target in Langerhans cells</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1227-t?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25127:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1227.20.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1227-t?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>3eb59024</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1227-t?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Williams, E.</name></author><published>1521135592000</published></item><item><engagement>97</engagement><title>Rethink public engagement for gene editing</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03269-3</link><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162480a98d2:3522cf9:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03269-3/d41586-018-03269-3_15541756.jpg</url><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03269-3</originId><published>1521615600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e9726c7b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03269-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rethink public engagement for gene editing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rethink public engagement for gene editing, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03269-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03269-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The breadth of social and moral questions raised requires a new architecture for democratic debate, insists Simon Burall.</content></content><author><name>Simon  Burall</name></author><crawled>1521627076818</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rethink public engagement for gene editing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rethink public engagement for gene editing, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03269-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03269-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The breadth of social and moral questions raised requires a new architecture for democratic debate, insists Simon Burall.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Correction: Survivin Mutant Protects Differentiated Dopaminergic SK-N-SH Cells Against Oxidative Stress</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194587</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62a:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194587</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194587</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><visual><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194587.g001</url><width>320</width><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>527</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><fingerprint>fedd9371</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194587</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Baratchi, Rupinder K.

Most Chinese lithic industries dated between 300,000 and 40,000 are characterized by the absence of Levallois debitage, the persistence of core-and-flake knapping, the rarity of prepared cores, their reduction with direct hard hammer percussion, and the rarity of retouched flakes. Here we report the discovery of seven bone soft hammers at the early hominin Lingjing site (Xuchang County, Henan) dated to 125,000–105,000. These artefacts represent the first instance of the use of bone as raw material to modify stone tools found at an East Asian early Late Pleistocene site. Three types of soft hammers are identified. The first consists of large bone flakes resulting from butchery of large herbivores that were utilized as such for expedient stone tools retouching or resharpening. The second involved the fracture of weathered bone from medium size herbivores to obtain elongated splinters shaped by percussion into sub-rectangular artefacts. Traces observed on these objects indicate intensive and possibly recurrent utilization, which implies their curation over time. The last consists of antler, occasionally used. Lingjing bone tools complement what we know about archaic hominin cultural adaptations in East Asia and highlight behavioural consistencies that could not be inferred from other cultural proxies. This discovery provides a new dimension to the debate surrounding the existence of the Middle Palaeolithic in the region. The attribution of East Asian sites to the Middle Palaeolithic assumes that cultural traits such as the Levallois method represent evolutionary hallmarks applicable to regions of the world different from those in which they were originally found.

Mosquitoes transmit a number of diseases in animals and humans, including Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses that affect millions of people each year. Controlling the disease-transmitting mosquitoes has proven to be a successful strategy to reduce the viruses transmission. Polyamines are required for the life cycle of the RNA viruses, Chikungunya virus and Zika virus, and a depletion of spermidine and spermine in the host via induction of spermine N-acetyltransferase restricts their replication. Spermine N-acetyltransferase is a key catabolic enzyme in the polyamine pathway, however there is no information of the enzyme identification in any insects. Aliphatic polyamines play a fundamental role in tissue growth and development in organisms. They are acetylated by spermidine/spermine &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-acetyltransferase (SAT). In this study we provided a molecular and biochemical identification of SAT from &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes. Screening of purified recombinant proteins against polyamines established that aaNAT5b, named previously based on sequence similarity with identified aaNAT1 in insects, is active to spermine and spermidine. A crystal structure was determined and used in molecular docking in this study. Key residues were identified to be involved in spermine binding using molecular docking and simulation. In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</content></content><author><name>Huai Guan</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huai Guan, Maoying Wang, Chenghong Liao, Jing Liang, Prajwalini Mehere, Meiling Tian, Hairong Liu, Howard Robinson, Jianyong Li, Qian Han&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, SAT transcript was down regulated by blood feeding using a real time PCR test. Based on its substrate profile and transcriptional levels after blood feeding, together with previous reports for polyamines required in arboviruses replication, SAT might be potentially used as a target to control arboviruses with human interference.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>21</engagement><title>Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO2 quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16266d0d910:5f99c86:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23621-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23621_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>232</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x</originId><published>1522134000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>bb9e7635</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/OKpeOlc517M/s41598-018-23621-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23621-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/OKpeOlc517M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Miruna Silvia Stan</name></author><crawled>1522143385872</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23621-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23621-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dynamic analysis of the interactions between Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots and biomolecules for improving applications based on nano-bio interfaces&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/OKpeOlc517M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Identifying optimal reference genes for the normalization of microRNA expression in cucumber under viral stress</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194436</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a620:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194436</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194436</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>6573054b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194436</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chaoqiong Liang, Jianjun Hao, Yan Meng, Laixin Luo, Jianqiang Li&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus&lt;/i&gt; (CGMMV) is an economically important pathogen and causes significant reduction of both yield and quality of cucumber (&lt;i&gt;Cucumis sativus&lt;/i&gt;). Currently, there were no satisfied strategies for controlling the disease. A better understanding of microRNA (miRNA) expression related to the regulation of plant-virus interactions and virus resistance would be of great assistance when developing control strategies for CGMMV. However, accurate expression analysis is highly dependent on robust and reliable reference gene used as an internal control for normalization of miRNA expression. Most commonly used reference genes involved in CGMMV-infected cucumber are not universally expressed depending on tissue types and stages of plant development. It is therefore crucial to identify suitable reference genes in investigating the role of miRNA expression. In this study, seven reference genes, including &lt;i&gt;Actin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tubulin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S rRNA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ubiquitin&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cyclophilin&lt;/i&gt;, were evaluated for the most accurate results in analyses using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

The reference genes were subsequently validated using miR159.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;(1) To use finite element (FE) modelling to estimate local iris stresses (i.e. internal forces) as a result of mechanical pupil expansion; and to (2) compare such stresses as generated from several commercially available expanders (Iris hooks, APX dilator and Malyugin ring) to determine which design and deployment method are most likely to cause iris damage.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used a biofidelic 3-part iris FE model that consisted of the stroma, sphincter and dilator muscles. Our FE model simulated expansion of the pupil from 3 mm to a maximum of 6 mm using the aforementioned pupil expanders, with uniform circular expansion used for baseline comparison. FE-derived stresses, resultant forces and area of final pupil opening were compared across devices for analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our FE models demonstrated that the APX dilator generated the highest stresses on the sphincter muscles, (max: 6.446 MPa; average: 5.112 MPa), followed by the iris hooks (max: 5.680 MPa; average: 5.219 MPa), and the Malyugin ring (max: 2.144 MPa; average: 1.575 MPa). Uniform expansion generated the lowest stresses (max: 0.435MPa; average: 0.377 MPa). For pupil expansion, the APX dilator required the highest force (41.22 mN), followed by iris hooks (40.82 mN) and the Malyugin ring (18.56 mN).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study predicted that current pupil expanders exert significantly higher amount of stresses and forces than required during pupil expansion.

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</content></content><author><name>Kokab B.

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</content></content><author><name>Stefan Schlager</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

When unifying genomic resources among studies and comparing data between species, there is often no better resource than a genome sequence. Having a reference genome for the Chinook salmon (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&lt;/i&gt;) will enable the extensive genomic resources available for Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow trout to be leveraged when asking questions related to the Chinook salmon. The Chinook salmon’s wide distribution, long cultural impact, evolutionary history, substantial hatchery production, and recent wild-population decline make it an important research species. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the genome of a Chilliwack River Hatchery female Chinook salmon (gynogenetic and homozygous at all loci). With a reference genome sequence, new questions can be asked about the nature of this species, and its role in a rapidly changing world.</content></content><author><name>Kris A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Trauma is a global burden of disease and one of the main causes of death worldwide. Therefore, many countries around the world have implemented a wide range of different initiatives to minimize mortality rates after trauma. One of these initiatives is the bundling of treatment expertise in trauma centers and the establishment of trauma networks.Germany has a decentralized system of trauma care medical centers. Severely injured patients ought to receive adequate treatment in both level I and level II centers. This study investigated the effectiveness of a decentralized network and the question whether level I and level II centers have comparable patient outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;In 2009, the first trauma network DGU&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in Germany was certified in the rural area of Eastern Bavaria. All patients admitted to the 25 participating hospitals were prospectively included in this network in the framework of a study sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research between March 2012 and February 2014. 2 hospitals were level I centers (maximal care centers), 8 hospitals were level II centers, and 15 hospitals were level III centers. The criterion for study inclusion was an injury severity score (ISS) ≥ 16 for patients´ primarily admitted to a level I or a level II center. Exclusion criteria were transferal to another hospital within 48 h, an unknown revised injury severity classification II score (RISC II), or primary admittance to a level III center (n = 52). 875 patients were included in the study.Univariate analyses were used regarding the preclinical and clinical parameters, the primary endpoint mortality rate, and the secondary endpoints length of stay, organ failure, and neurological outcome (GOS). The primary endpoint was additionally evaluated by means of multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Indices for injury severity (GCS, AIS&lt;sub&gt;Head&lt;/sub&gt;, ISS, and NISS) as well as the predicted probability of death (RISC II) were higher in level I centers than in level II centers.No significant differences were found between the mortality rate of the unadjusted analysis [level I: 21.6% (CI: 16.5, 27.9), level II: 18.1% (CI: 14.4, 22.5), p = 0.28] and that of the adjusted analysis [level I SMR: 0.94 (CI: 0.72, 1.21), level II SMR: 1.18 (CI 0.95, 1.48) SMR: expected vs. calculated mortality rate according to RISC II]. Multivariable analysis showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13% (RISC II). The number need to treat was 10 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that a rural trauma network with centralized and local structures may achieve equivalent results with regard to mortality rates to those obtained in level I and level II centers. These results were furthered by a certain preclinical centralization (24/7 air rescue) of patients. The study also showed a survival advantage of patients admitted to a level I center with a probability of death of 13%. Preclinical and initial clinical evaluation with regard to probable mortality rates should be further improved to identify patients who would benefit from admittance to a level I center.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Antonio Ernstberger</name></author><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Antonio Ernstberger, Michael Koller, Florian Zeman, Maximilian Kerschbaum, Franz Hilber, Eva Diepold, Julika Loss, Tanja Herbst, Michael Nerlich, Trauma Centers of the Trauma Network of Eastern Bavaria (TraumaNetzwerk Ostbayern − TNO) &lt;/p&gt;

We present a new educational initiative called Meet-U that aims to train students for collaborative work in computational biology and to bridge the gap between education and research. Meet-U mimics the setup of collaborative research projects and takes advantage of the most popular tools for collaborative work and of cloud computing. Students are grouped in teams of 4–5 people and have to realize a project from A to Z that answers a challenging question in biology. Meet-U promotes &amp;quot;coopetition,&amp;quot; as the students collaborate within and across the teams and are also in competition with each other to develop the best final product. Meet-U fosters interactions between different actors of education and research through the organization of a meeting day, open to everyone, where the students present their work to a jury of researchers and jury members give research seminars. This very unique combination of education and research is strongly motivating for the students and provides a formidable opportunity for a scientific community to unite and increase its visibility. We report on our experience with Meet-U in two French universities with master’s students in bioinformatics and modeling, with protein–protein docking as the subject of the course. Meet-U is easy to implement and can be straightforwardly transferred to other fields and/or universities.

Background &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks have occurred in some countries despite supplementary immunization activities (SIA) using measles-containing vaccine with high vaccination coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey to estimate population immunity in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic where repeated mass immunization has failed to eliminate measles.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In this nationwide multistage cluster sampling survey conducted in 2014 based on probability proportionate to size sampling, blood samples were collected from 2,135 children and adults living in 52 randomly selected villages. Anti-measles and anti-rubella IgG were measured, and IgG prevalence was calculated. We applied mathematical modelling to estimate the number of cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in 2013 that were averted by the 2011 SIA. A stability testing was applied to the MR vaccine at 4°C, 25°C, and 35°C to examine stability differences between measles and rubella vaccine components. Measles IgG prevalence was significantly lower in the target age groups (5–21 years) of the 2011 SIA using a combination vaccine for measles and rubella vaccine (MR vaccine) than in young adults (22–39 years) (86.8% [95% CI: 83.0–90.6] vs. 99.0% [98.3–99.8]; p&amp;lt;0.001), whereas rubella IgG prevalence was significantly higher (88.2% [84.5–91.8] vs. 74.6% [70.7–78.5]; p&amp;lt;0.001). In the SIA target age groups, prevalence of measles IgG, but not rubella IgG, increased with age. CRS cases prevented in 2013 ranged from 16 [0–50] to 92 [32–180] if the force of infection had remained unchanged or had been reduced by 75%, respectively. In freeze-dried conditions, the measles vaccine component was more heat sensitive than the rubella component.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Inconsistent IgG prevalence between measles and rubella in Lao PDR can be partly explained by different stability of the measles and rubella vaccine components under heat exposure. Suboptimal vaccine handling may cause insufficient immunogenicity for measles, which subsequently leads to an outbreak despite high SIA coverage, while direct evidence is lacking. Temperature monitoring of the vaccine should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Masahiko Hachiya</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masahiko Hachiya, Shinsuke Miyano, Yoshio Mori, Emilia Vynnycky, Phath Keungsaneth, Phengta Vongphrachanh, Anonh Xeuatvongsa, Thongchanh Sisouk, Vilasak Som-Oulay, Bouaphan Khamphaphongphane, Bounthanom Sengkeopaseuth, Chansay Pathammavong, Kongxay Phounphenghak, Tomomi Kitamura, Makoto Takeda, Katsuhiro Komase&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, the incidence and mortality rates of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been steadily increasing in young women but not in men. Environmental variables that contribute to cardiovascular events in women remain ill-defined.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;A total of 2199 consecutive patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 25.8% women, mean age 62.6±12.4 years) were admitted at the Montreal Heart Institute between June 2010 and December 2014. Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent. Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Catherine Gebhard</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine Gebhard, Caroline E.

Snow fall exceeding 2cm/day was identified as a positive predictor for STEMI admission rates in the overall population (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.48, p = 0.005), with a significant effect being seen in men (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06–1.53, p = 0.01) but not in women (p = NS). An age-specific analysis revealed a significant increase in hospital admission rates for STEMI in younger women ≤55 years, (n = 104) during days with higher outside temperature (p = 0.004 vs men ≤55 years) and longer daylight hours (p = 0.0009 vs men ≤55 years). Accordingly, summer season, increased outside temperature and sunshine hours were identified as strong positive predictors for STEMI occurrence in women ≤55 years (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1–2.5, p = 0.012, RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.007, and RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.5, p = 0.011, respectively), while an opposite trend was observed in men ≤55 years (RR for outside temperature 0.8, 95% CI 0.73–0.95, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The impact of environmental variables on STEMI is age- and sex-dependent. Higher temperature may play an important role in triggering such acute events in young women.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Accurate Filtering of Privacy-Sensitive Information in Raw Genomic Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292185v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1627789c54e:7b8b540:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/292185</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292185v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e7216123</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292185v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Sequencing thousands of human genomes has enabled breakthroughs in many areas, among them precision medicine, the study of rare diseases, and forensics.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar. Postural disequilibrium reported in both conditions may thus be explained by similar deviations in postural control strategies. 75 females (25/group FM, CFS and control, age 19–49 years) performed 60 s of quiet standing on a force platform in each of three conditions: 1) firm surface with vision, 2) firm surface without vision and, 3) compliant surface with vision. Migration of center of pressure was decomposed into a slow and a fast component denoting postural sway and lateral forces controlling postural sway, analyzed in the time and frequency domains. Main effects of group for the antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions showed that patients displayed larger amplitudes (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021) and lower frequencies (AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) for the slow component, as well as for the fast component (amplitudes: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001 and frequencies: AP, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001; ML, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029) compared to controls.

As many similar symptoms are reported in fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), underlying defcits may potentially also be similar.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing disease without satisfactory treatments, in which intestinal inflammation and disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier are two main pathogeneses triggering UC. Berberrubine (BB) is deemed as one of the major active metabolite of berberine (BBR), a naturally-occurring isoquinoline alkaloid with appreciable anti-UC effect. This study aimed to comparatively investigate the therapeutic effects of BB and BBR on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced mouse colitis model, and explore the potential underlying mechanism. Results revealed that BB (20 mg/kg) produced a comparable therapeutic effect as BBR (50 mg/kg) and positive control sulfasalazine (200 mg/kg) by significantly reducing the disease activity index (DAI) with prolonged colon length and increased bodyweight as compared with the DSS group. BB treatment was shown to significantly ameliorate the DSS-induced colonic pathological alternations and decreased histological scores. In addition, BB markedly attenuated colonic inflammation by alleviating inflammatory cell infiltration and inhibiting myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-10) productions in DSS mice. Furthermore, BB treatment substantially upregulated the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins (zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, claudin-1, occludin) and mRNA expression of mucins (mucin-1 and mucin-2), and decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In summary, BB exerted similar effect to its analogue BBR and positive control in attenuating DSS-induced UC with much lower dosage and similar mechanism. The protective effect observed may be intimately associated with maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and mitigating intestinal inflammation, which were mediated at least partially, via favorable modulation of TJ proteins and mucins and inhibition of inflammatory mediators productions in the colonic tissue. This is the first report to demonstrate that BB possesses pronounced anti-UC effect similar to BBR and sulfasalazine with much smaller dosage. BB might have the potential to be further developed into a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of UC.</content></content><author><name>Xiu-Ting Yu</name></author><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiu-Ting Yu, Yi-Fei Xu, Yan-Feng Huang, Chang Qu, Lie-Qiang Xu, Zi-Ren Su, Hui-Fang Zeng, Lin Zheng, Tie-Gang Yi, Hui-Lin Li, Jian-Ping Chen, Xiao-Jun Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Patients with inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) are frequently exposed to computed tomography (CT). Each CT exposes patients to radiation that cumulatively could increase the risk of malignancy, particularly in younger patients. We aim to study the effect of age on CT use in IBD patients seen in the Emergency Department (ED) or the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study of IBD patients identified in Truven Health Marketscan databases between 2009–2013. The main outcome was use of CT during an ED or inpatient visit. Effect of age on CT use was characterized using logistic regression accounting for important covariables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 66,731 patients with IBD with 144,147 ED or inpatient visits in this cohort with a diagnosis code of IBD. At first visit, 5.8% percent were below age 18. CT was utilized in 26.6% of visits. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for medications, recent surgery, and gender, patients 18–35 were more likely to undergo CT (OR 2.35, 95%CI: 2.20–2.52) compared to those &amp;lt;18. Examining patients only between 16 and 19, the odds of an 18 or 19-year-old undergoing CT is significantly higher than a 16 or 17-year-old (OR 1.96, 95%CI: 1.71–2.24).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with IBD undergo CT more than a quarter of the time in the ED or inpatient setting. Pediatric providers limit radiation exposure among those &amp;lt;18 while adult providers are not as cautious with radiation exposure for the young adult population.

Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensing protein that regulates the function of a large number of proteins, thus playing a crucial part in many cell signaling pathways. CaM has the ability to bind more than 300 different target peptides in a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner, mainly through the exposure of hydrophobic residues. How CaM can bind a large number of targets while retaining some selectivity is a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the mechanism of CaM selective promiscuity for selected target proteins. Analyzing enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-bound and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free CaM via spectral clustering has allowed us to identify distinct conformational states, characterized by interhelical angles, secondary structure determinants and the solvent exposure of specific residues. We searched for indicators of conformational selection by mapping solvent exposure of residues in these conformational states to contacts in structures of CaM/target peptide complexes. We thereby identified CaM states involved in various binding classes arranged along a depth binding gradient. Binding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; modifies the accessible hydrophobic surface of the two lobes and allows for deeper binding. Apo CaM indeed shows shallow binding involving predominantly polar and charged residues. Furthermore, binding to the C-terminal lobe of CaM appears selective and involves specific conformational states that can facilitate deep binding to target proteins, while binding to the N-terminal lobe appears to happen through a more flexible mechanism. Thus the long-ranged electrostatic interactions of the charged residues of the N-terminal lobe of CaM may initiate binding, while the short-ranged interactions of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal lobe of CaM may account for selectivity. This work furthers our understanding of the mechanism of CaM binding and selectivity to different target proteins and paves the way towards a comprehensive model of CaM selectivity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nnr4XNya7Zs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Annie M.

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway. TIMP-3 increased levels of the First Apoptosis Signal receptor (FAS) and depletion of FAS with shRNA showed TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was FAS dependent. TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</content></content><author><name>William R.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (&amp;lt;8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</content></content><author><name>Jong Seo Yoon</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Seo Yoon, Cheol Hwan So, Hae Sang Lee, Jung Sub Lim, Jin Soon Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) causes progressive disability in 1 of every 5,000 boys due to the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Despite much advancement in knowledge about DMD disease presentation and progression—attributable in part to studies using mouse and canine models of the disease–current DMD treatments are not equally effective in all patients. There remains, therefore, a need for translational animal models in which novel treatment targets can be identified and evaluated. Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) is a phenotypically and genetically homologous animal model of DMD. As with DMD, speed of disease progression in GRMD varies substantially. However, unlike DMD, all GRMD dogs possess the same causal mutation; therefore genetic modifiers of phenotypic variation are relatively easier to identify. Furthermore, the GRMD dogs used in this study reside within the same colony, reducing the confounding effects of environment on phenotypic variation. To detect modifiers of disease progression, we developed gene expression profiles using RNA sequencing for 9 dogs: 6 GRMD dogs (3 with faster-progressing and 3 with slower-progressing disease, based on quantitative, objective biomarkers) and 3 control dogs from the same colony. All dogs were evaluated at 2 time points: early disease onset (3 months of age) and the point at which GRMD stabilizes (6 months of age) using quantitative, objective biomarkers identified as robust against the effects of relatedness/inbreeding. Across all comparisons, the most differentially expressed genes fell into 3 categories: myogenesis/muscle regeneration, metabolism, and inflammation. Our findings are largely in concordance with DMD and mouse model studies, reinforcing the utility of GRMD as a translational model. Novel findings include the strong up-regulation of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) in faster-progressing GRMD dogs, suggesting previously unexplored mechanisms underlie progression speed in GRMD and DMD. In summary, our findings support the utility of RNA sequencing for evaluating potential biomarkers of GRMD progression speed, and are valuable for identifying new avenues of exploration in DMD research.</content></content><author><name>Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford</name></author><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Candice Brinkmeyer-Langford, Candice Chu, Cynthia Balog-Alvarez, Xue Yu, James J.

Vocal development is usually studied from the perspective of neuroscience. In this issue, Zhang and Ghazanfar propose a way in which body growth might condition the process. They study the vocalizations of marmoset infants with a wide range of techniques that include computational models and experiments that mimic growth reversal. Their results suggest that the qualitative changes that occur during development are rooted in the nonlinear interaction between the nervous system and the biomechanics involved in respiration. This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Gabriel B.

This work illustrates how an integrative approach enriches our understanding of behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zvNFkUWyj-M&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Decline and poleward shift in Indian summer monsoon synoptic activity in a warming climate [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2681.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1622099e6cb:661314:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/11/2681/F1.medium.gif</url><width>440</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>295</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2681</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2681.short?rss=1</originId><published>1520961998000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>1f256ca0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2681.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cyclonic atmospheric vortices of varying intensity, collectively known as low-pressure systems (LPS), travel northwest across central India and produce more than half of the precipitation received by that fertile region and its ∼600 million inhabitants.

Spinal motoneurones (Mns) constitute the final output for the execution of motor tasks. In addition to innervating muscles, Mns project excitatory collateral connections to Renshaw cells (RCs) and other Mns, but the latter have received little attention. We show that Mns receive strong synaptic input from other Mns throughout development and into maturity, with fast-type Mns systematically receiving greater recurrent excitation than slow-type Mns. Optical recordings show that activation of Mns in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. While it is known that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and RCs are excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that neurotransmission between Mns is purely glutamatergic, indicating that synaptic transmission systems are differentiated at different postsynaptic targets of Mns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8cEYlJIEZjs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Gardave S.

Despite much progress, few genetic findings for schizophrenia have been assessed by functional validation experiments at the molecular level. We previously reported evidence for genetic linkage of broadly defined schizophrenia to chromosome 17q25 in a sample of 24 multiplex families. 2,002 SNPs under this linkage peak were analyzed for evidence of linkage disequilibrium using the posterior probability of linkage (PPL) framework. SNP rs1060120 produced the strongest evidence for association, with a PPLD|L score of 0.21. This SNP is located within the 3&apos;UTR of the histone gene &lt;i&gt;H3F3B&lt;/i&gt; and colocalizes with potential gene target miR-616. A custom miRNA target prediction program predicted that the binding of miR-616 to &lt;i&gt;H3F3B&lt;/i&gt; transcripts would be altered by the allelic variants of rs1060120. We used dual luciferase assays to experimentally validate this interaction. The rs1060120 A allele significantly reduced luciferase expression, indicating a stronger interaction with miR-616 than the G allele (p = 0.000412). These results provide functional validation that this SNP could alter schizophrenia epigenetic mechanisms thereby contributing to schizophrenia-related disease risk.</content></content><author><name>William Manley</name></author><crawled>1520877426683</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Manley, Michael P.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Aspartame (L-aspartyl phenylalanine methyl ester) is a non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) approved for use in more than 6000 dietary products and pharmaceuticals consumed by the general public including adults and children, pregnant and nursing mothers. However a recent prospective study reported a doubling of the risk of being overweight amongst 1-year old children whose mothers consumed NNS-sweetened beverages daily during pregnancy. We have previously shown that chronic aspartame (ASP) exposure commencing &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; may detrimentally affect adulthood adiposity status, glucose metabolism and aspects of behavior and spatial cognition, and that this can be modulated by developmental N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade with the competitive antagonist CGP 39551 (CGP). Since glucose homeostasis and certain aspects of behavior and locomotion are regulated in part by the NMDAR-rich hypothalamus, which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal- (HPA) axis, we have elected to examine changes in hypothalamic and adrenal gene expression in response to ASP exposure in the presence or absence of developmental NMDAR antagonism with CGP, using Affymetrix microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2-factor ANOVA we identified 189 ASP-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the adult male hypothalamus and 2188 in the adrenals, and a further 23 hypothalamic and 232 adrenal genes significantly regulated by developmental treatment with CGP alone. ASP exposure robustly elevated the expression of a network of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis, together with cell stress and inflammatory genes, consistent with previous reports of aspartame-induced CNS stress and oxidative damage. These genes were not differentially expressed in ASP mice with CGP antagonism. In the adrenal glands of ASP-exposed mice, GABA and Glutamate receptor subunit genes were amongst those most highly upregulated. Developmental NMDAR antagonism alone had less effect on adulthood gene expression and affected mainly hypothalamic neurogenesis and adrenal steroid metabolism. Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Kate S.

Combined ASP + CGP treatment mainly upregulated genes involved in adrenal drug and cholesterol metabolism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ASP exposure increased the expression of functional networks of genes involved in hypothalamic neurosteroidogenesis and adrenal catecholamine synthesis, patterns of expression which were not present in ASP-exposed mice with developmental NMDAR antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Global amphibian declines have winners and losers [Ecology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3739.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162b12a08af:1e3a9:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3739</canonicalUrl><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3739.short?rss=1</originId><published>1523386900000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>152e4a1e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3739.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Global change imperils a large swath of the planet’s biodiversity, portending a future with decreasing species richness and functioning of natural ecosystems (1).

Viral expression of wild type (exWT) and mutant MORs, where all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus (Total Phosphorylation Deficient (TPD)) were mutated to alanine, were examined in locus coeruleus neurons in a MOR knockout rat. Both receptors activated potassium conductance similar to endogenous receptors in wild type animals. The exWT receptors, like endogenous receptors, acutely desensitized, internalized and, after chronic morphine treatment, displayed signs of tolerance.

Viral expression of wild type (exWT) and mutant MORs, where all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus (Total Phosphorylation Deficient (TPD)) were mutated to alanine, were examined in locus coeruleus neurons in a MOR knockout rat. Both receptors activated potassium conductance similar to endogenous receptors in wild type animals. The exWT receptors, like endogenous receptors, acutely desensitized, internalized and, after chronic morphine treatment, displayed signs of tolerance. However, TPD receptors did not desensitize or internalize with agonist treatment. In addition the TPD receptors did not develop cellular tolerance following chronic morphine treatment. Thus C-terminal phosphorylation is necessary for the expression of acute desensitization, trafficking and one sign of long-term tolerance to morphine at the cellular level.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Production of blastocysts following in vitro maturation and fertilization of dromedary camel oocytes vitrified at the germinal vesicle stage</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194602</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62c:9f3b30f2</id><updated>1521147600000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194602</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194602</originId><published>1521147600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>4e4e29d9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194602</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohamed Fathi, Adel R.

Cryopreservation of oocytes would serve as an alternative to overcome the limited availability of dromedary camel oocytes and facilitate improvements in IVP techniques in this species. Our goal was to develop a protocol for the vitrification of camel oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage using different cryoprotectant combinations: 20% EG and 20% DMSO (VS1), 25% EG plus 25% DMSO (VS2) or 25% EG and 25% glycerol (VS3) and various cryo-carriers; straws or open pulled-straw (OPS) or solid surface vitrification (SSV); and Cryotop. Viable oocytes were cultured in vitro for 30 h. Matured oocytes were fertilized with epididymal spermatozoa and then cultured in vitro in modified KSOMaa medium for 7 days. Survival and nuclear maturation rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in oocytes exposed to VS3 (44.8% and 34.0%, respectively) than those exposed to VS1 (68.2% and 48.0%, respectively) and VS2 (79.3% and 56.9%, respectively). Although recovery rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in SSV and Cryotop vitrified oocytes (66.9% to 71.1%) than those vitrified by straws with VS1 or VS2 solutions (86.3% to 91.0%), survival rates were higher in the SSV and Cryotop groups (90.7% to 94.8%) than in the straw and OPS groups (68.2% to 86.5%).

Preservation of residual hearing after cochlear implant is an important issue with regards to hearing performance. Various methods of steroid administration have been widely used in clinical practice to reduce inflammation and preserve residual hearing. Here we compare the effect of different routes of dexamethasone administration on intracochlear inflammation and residual hearing in guinea pig ears. Dexamethasone was delivered into the guinea pigs either through intracochlear, intratympanic or systemic route. The intracochlear concentration of dexamethasone, residual hearing, inflammatory cytokines and histopathologic changes were evaluated over time. A higher intracochlear dexamethasone concentration was observed after intracochlear administration than through the other routes. Residual hearing was better preserved with local dexamethasone administration as was supported by the reduced inflammatory cytokines, more hair cell survival and less severe intracochlear fibrosis and ossification concurrently seen in the local delivery group than in the systemic group. The results demonstrate that local dexamethasone delivery can reduce intracochlear inflammation and preserve residual hearing better than in systemically administered dexamethasone.</content></content><author><name>Ah-Ra Lyu</name></author><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ah-Ra Lyu, Dong Hyun Kim, Seung Hun Lee, Dong-Sik Shin, Sun-Ae Shin, Yong-Ho Park&lt;/p&gt;

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become an important issue in the healthcare systems of both developed and developing countries. Phytoestrogens have shown estrogenic effects, which may involve in the etiology of MetS. The current study consisted of 293 MetS cases and 264 healthy controls. The concentrations of seven plasma phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, enterolactone, enterodiol and coumestrol) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and risks of MetS, as well as the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and MetS components. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between equol concentration in equol-producers and MetS components. Higher concentrations of total isoflavone and equol were associated with decreased risk of MetS. The equol concentration was negatively associated with waist circumference and positively associated with HDL-C level. Increased daidzein was associated with both lower waist circumference and lower fasting blood glucose levels. Our results suggested that higher plasma total isoflavone, equol and daidzein might decrease MetS risk.</content></content><author><name>Jie Liu</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jie Liu, Shengquan Mi, Li Du, Xiang Li, Peiqin Li, Keyu Jia, Jing Zhao, Hong Zhang, Wenhua Zhao, Ying Gao&lt;/p&gt;

Our results suggested that higher plasma total isoflavone, equol and daidzein might decrease MetS risk.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00167</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><title>[ASAP] Molecular and Physiological Characterization of a Receptor for d-Amino Acid-Containing Neuropeptides</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00167</link><id>ofNPcmQ46PpGzt1nO49W9STAvkUsM7jssLxNXMp09ME=_162880776db:d9685:a077e55f</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00167/20180402/images/medium/cb-2018-00167z_0008.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>250</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00167</originId><crawled>1522700613339</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId></origin><fingerprint>b873150b</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00167/20180402/images/medium/cb-2018-00167z_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00167&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</content></content><author><name>Gusztáv Schay</name></author><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

Data were taken from cross-sectional studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;marneffei&lt;/i&gt; and a control cohort or a cohort with standard fungus culture.

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Timothy E.

Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jonathan Schiefer</name></author><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hemorrhagic transformation is a major complication of ischemic stroke, is linked to matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and is exacerbated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is characterized by SUR1-TRPM4 (sulfonylurea receptor 1—transient receptor potential melastatin 4) channel upregulation in microvascular endothelium. In humans and rodents with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), the SUR1 antagonist, glibenclamide, reduces hemorrhagic transformation and plasma MMP-9, but the mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that tPA induces protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1)-mediated, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium, and that SUR1-TRPM4 is required for this process.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R, of 2 and 4 hours duration, respectively, was obtained using conventional middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immunolabeling was used to quantify p65 nuclear translocation. Murine and human brain endothelial cells (BEC) were studied &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, without and with NF-κB activation, using immunoblot, zymography and ELISA, patch clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations were used to identify signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Cerebral I/R caused prominent nuclear translocation of p65 in microvascular endothelium. NF-κB-activation of BEC caused &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; expression of SUR1-TRPM4 channels. In NF-κB-activated BEC: (i) tPA caused opening of SUR1-TRPM4 channels in a plasmin-, PAR1-, TRPC3- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent manner; (ii) tPA caused PAR1-dependent secretion of MMP-9; (iii) tonic secretion of MMP-9 by activated BEC was not influenced by SUR1 inhibition; (iv) phasic secretion of MMP-9 induced by tPA or the PAR1-agonist, TFLLR, required functional SUR1-TRPM4 channels, with inhibition of SUR1 decreasing tPA-induced MMP-9 secretion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;tPA induces PAR1-mediated, SUR1-TRPM4-dependent, phasic secretion of MMP-9 from activated brain endothelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Volodymyr Gerzanich</name></author><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Volodymyr Gerzanich, Min Seong Kwon, Seung Kyoon Woo, Alexander Ivanov, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3–5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3–12 months is recommended in international guidelines.

Based on a patient’s first positive CT or NG test, the proportion of TOC (&amp;lt;3 months) and retests (3–12 months) were calculated.

GP practices in low SES areas were more likely to perform a CT TOC (OR:1.8;95%CI:1.1–3.1). Younger patients (&amp;lt;25 years) were more likely to have a CT TOC (OR:1.6;95%CI:1.0–2.4). For CT (n = 622), 2.4% had a TOC and 6.1% had a retest at another STI care provider. For NG (n = 73), 25% had a TOC and 15% had a retest at the GP practice. For NG (n = 73), 2.7% had a TOC and 12.3% had a retest at another STI care provider. In only 0.3% of the consultations patients were tested on extragenital sites.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of the patients returned for a CT TOC, especially at GP practices in low SES areas. For NG, 1 out of 4 patients returned for a TOC. Retesting rates were low for both CT (24%) and NG (15%), (re)infections including extragenital infections may be missed.

Background &lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3–5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3–12 months is recommended in international guidelines. We assessed TOC and retesting practices including extragenital testing in general practitioner (GP) practices located in different socioeconomic status (SES) areas to inform and optimize local test practices.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Laboratory data of 48 Dutch GP practices between January 2011 and July 2016 were used.

Autophagy is a cellular mechanism that can generate energy for cells or clear misfolded or aggregated proteins, and upregulating this process has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe a novel set of LC3B-II and p62 time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assays that can detect changes in autophagy in the absence of exogenous labels. Lipidated LC3 is a marker of autophagosomes, while p62 is a substrate of autophagy. These assays can be employed in high-throughput screens to identify novel autophagy upregulators, and can measure autophagy changes in cultured cells or tissues after genetic or pharmacological interventions. We also demonstrate that different cells exhibit varying autophagic responses to pharmacological interventions. Overall, it is clear that a battery of readouts is required to make conclusions about changes in autophagy.</content></content><author><name>Alberto Bresciani</name></author><crawled>1521491049124</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Bresciani, Maria Carolina Spiezia, Roberto Boggio, Cristina Cariulo, Anja Nordheim, Roberta Altobelli, Kirsten Kuhlbrodt, Celia Dominguez, Ignacio Munoz-Sanjuan, John Wityak, Valentina Fodale, Deanna M.

Overall, it is clear that a battery of readouts is required to make conclusions about changes in autophagy.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Biosynthetic Proteases That Catalyze the Macrocyclization of Ribosomally Synthesized Linear Peptides</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162683f7665:4349aa:bdf8aaf1</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00114/20180327/images/medium/bi-2018-001146_0006.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>139</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114</originId><crawled>1522167412325</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>e595a3d</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00114/20180327/images/medium/bi-2018-001146_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00114&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine’s contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty eight studies (n&gt;50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (&gt;60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (&amp;lt;22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48–65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nicola R.

Sublethal heat stress may weaken bed bug infestations to potentially ease control. In the present study, experimental populations exposed to 34, 36 or 38°C for 2 or 3 weeks suffered significant mortality during exposure. Among survivors, egg production, egg hatching, moulting success and offspring proliferation decreased significantly in the subsequent 7 week recovery period at 22°C. The overall population success was negatively impacted by increasing temperature and duration of the stress. Such heat stress is inadequate as a single tool for eradication, but may be included as a low cost part of an integrated pest management protocol.

Mannitol oxidase and polyol dehydrogenases are enzymes that convert polyalcohols into sugars. Mannitol oxidase was previously investigated in terrestrial snails and slugs, being also present in a few aquatic gastropods. However, the overall distribution of this enzyme in the Gastropoda was not known. Polyol dehydrogenases are also poorly studied in gastropods and other mollusks. In this study, polyalcohol oxidase and dehydrogenase activities were assayed in the digestive gland of 26 species of gastropods, representing the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha, Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial species, including herbivores and carnivores were analyzed. Ultrastructural observations were undertake in species possessing mannitol oxidase, in order to investigate the correlation between this enzyme and the presence of tubular structures known to be associated with it. Mannitol oxidase activity was detected in the digestive gland of herbivores from the clades Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, but not in any carnivores or in herbivores from the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha and Vetigastropoda. In most of the species used in this study, dehydrogenase activities were detected using both D-mannitol and D-sorbitol as substrates. Nevertheless, in some carnivores these activities were not detected with both polyalcohols. Ultrastructural observations revealed tubular structures in digestive gland cells of some species having mannitol oxidase activity, but they were not observed in others. Based on our results, we suggest that mannitol oxidase first occurred in a herbivorous or omnivorous ancestor of Apogastropoda, the clade formed by caenogastropods and heterobranchs, being subsequently lost in those species that shifted towards a carnivorous diet.</content></content><author><name>Alexandre Lobo-da-Cunha</name></author><crawled>1520876345325</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandre Lobo-da-Cunha, Diogo Amaral-de-Carvalho, Elsa Oliveira, Ângela Alves, Vítor Costa, Gonçalo Calado&lt;/p&gt;

Ultrastructural observations were undertake in species possessing mannitol oxidase, in order to investigate the correlation between this enzyme and the presence of tubular structures known to be associated with it. Mannitol oxidase activity was detected in the digestive gland of herbivores from the clades Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia, but not in any carnivores or in herbivores from the clades Patellogastropoda, Neritimorpha and Vetigastropoda. In most of the species used in this study, dehydrogenase activities were detected using both D-mannitol and D-sorbitol as substrates. Nevertheless, in some carnivores these activities were not detected with both polyalcohols. Ultrastructural observations revealed tubular structures in digestive gland cells of some species having mannitol oxidase activity, but they were not observed in others. Based on our results, we suggest that mannitol oxidase first occurred in a herbivorous or omnivorous ancestor of Apogastropoda, the clade formed by caenogastropods and heterobranchs, being subsequently lost in those species that shifted towards a carnivorous diet.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>23</engagement><title>What exactly is ‘&amp;lt;i&gt;N&amp;lt;/i&gt;’ in cell culture and animal experiments?</title><recrawled>1522864992038</recrawled><engagementRate>0.72</engagementRate><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16291bed3a0:b8480a:76251cdd</id><updated>1522875600000</updated><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</originId><published>1522875600000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005282</link><fingerprint>37283983</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/h-ldp2fjUm4/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stanley E.

Biologists determine experimental effects by perturbing biological entities or units. When done appropriately, independent replication of the entity–intervention pair contributes to the sample size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) and forms the basis of statistical inference. If the wrong entity–intervention pair is chosen, an experiment cannot address the question of interest. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents and effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities provide clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17%–29%) replicated the correct entity–intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Nearly half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38%–53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26%–39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, and thus the evidence for a scientific claim, resulting in false positives. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide concrete examples of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental designs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/h-ldp2fjUm4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Stanley E.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the photochemical degradation of trypan blue (TB) and to identify decomposition products.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Defined solution samples of TB and a mixture with lutein/zeaxanthin were exposed to blue light. Thermal degradation processes were ruled out using controls not subjected to irradiation. All samples were analyzed using optical microscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry. Degradation kinetics were determined based on changes in absorbance; intermediates were identified by analyzing mass differences of characteristic fragment ion peaks within the fragmentation patterns, and assignments were verified by NMR.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photochemical degradation, which can be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin. Intermediates vary depending on the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin. The self-sensitized photodegradation of TB occurs under generation of dimethyl sulfate and presumed formation of phenol. In contrast, within the presence of lutein/zeaxanthin the decomposition of TB indicates the formation of methoxyamine and sulfonyl arin. Thermal degradation processes were not observed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;TB demonstrated a photodegradation that may be triggered by lutein/zeaxanthin and results in the formation of cytotoxic decomposition products.

Background &lt;p&gt;During the last decade, an increasing popularity of marathons has been seen. Although running has been shown to have considerable positive health effects, the risk of sudden death, most often due to sudden cardiac arrests, is also a risk runners expose themselves to. Whilst there are some studies on the mortality amongst long-distance runners, much of the evidence is dated. Given the increased popularity in running during the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century as well as the improvements in medical care at marathons, more knowledge is required on the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and method &lt;p&gt;Publicly available racing and news databases were used to identify the number of entrants and finishers in half to full marathons in Sweden between 2007 and 2016 and the number of deaths that occurred in conjunction with the races.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1,156,271 runners entered a long distance (21-42km) running race in Sweden between 2007 and 2016, and 834,412 runners finished the races (72.2%). A large majority of the finishers (677,050 (81%)) competed in distances under a full marathon. Two deaths occurred during the time period, meaning that the death rate was 0.24 (95% confidence interval 0.04–0.79) per 100,000 finishers.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study can show that death rates in long distance running races between 2007 and 2016 in Sweden are very low, compared to previous studies.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</content></content><author><name>Martina Di Fede</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many university students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical students in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015 academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons participants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall, significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implementation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.</content></content><author><name>Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani</name></author><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hamza Mohammad Abdulghani, Shafiul Haque, Yousef Abdullah Almusalam, Saleh Lafi Alanezi, Yazeed Abdulaziz Alsulaiman, Mohammad Irshad, Shaffi Ahmed Shaik, Nehal Khamis&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Hospital inpatients often experience medical and psychiatric problems simultaneously. Although this implies a certain relationship between healthcare utilization and costs, this relationship has never been systematically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective is to examine the extent to which medical-psychiatric comorbidities relate to health-economic outcomes in general and in different subgroups. If the relationship is significant, this would give additional reasons to facilitate the search for targeted and effective treatments for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic review in Embase, Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar was performed up to August 2016 and included cross-references from included studies. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies examining the impact of inpatient medical-psychiatric comorbidities on three health-economic outcomes (length of stay (LOS), medical costs and rehospitalizations) were included. Study design was not an exclusion criterion, there were no restrictions on publication dates and patients included had to be over 18 years. The examined populations consisted of inpatients with medical-psychiatric comorbidities and controls. The controls were inpatients without a comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder. Non-English studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From electronic literature databases, 3165 extracted articles were scrutinized on the basis of title and abstract. This resulted in a full-text review of 86 articles: 52 unique studies were included. The review showed that the presence of medical-psychiatric comorbidity was related to increased LOS, higher medical costs and more rehospitalizations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hospital inpatients often experience medical and psychiatric problems simultaneously. Although this implies a certain relationship between healthcare utilization and costs, this relationship has never been systematically reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective is to examine the extent to which medical-psychiatric comorbidities relate to health-economic outcomes in general and in different subgroups. If the relationship is significant, this would give additional reasons to facilitate the search for targeted and effective treatments for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;A systematic review in Embase, Medline, Psycinfo, Cochrane, Web of Science and Google Scholar was performed up to August 2016 and included cross-references from included studies. Only peer-reviewed empirical studies examining the impact of inpatient medical-psychiatric comorbidities on three health-economic outcomes (length of stay (LOS), medical costs and rehospitalizations) were included. Study design was not an exclusion criterion, there were no restrictions on publication dates and patients included had to be over 18 years. The examined populations consisted of inpatients with medical-psychiatric comorbidities and controls. The controls were inpatients without a comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder. Non-English studies were excluded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From electronic literature databases, 3165 extracted articles were scrutinized on the basis of title and abstract. This resulted in a full-text review of 86 articles: 52 unique studies were included. The review showed that the presence of medical-psychiatric comorbidity was related to increased LOS, higher medical costs and more rehospitalizations. The meta-analysis revealed that patients with comorbid depression had an increased mean LOS of 4.38 days compared to patients without comorbidity (95% CI: 3.07 to 5.68, I2 = 31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Medical-psychiatric comorbidity is related to increased LOS, medical costs and rehospitalization; this is also shown for specific subgroups. This study had some limitations; namely, that the studies were very heterogenetic and, in some cases, of poor quality in terms of risk of bias. Nevertheless, the findings remain valid and justify the search for targeted and effective interventions for this complex population.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Aging muscle: Use it or lose it</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-c?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a52983a:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/45.3.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-c?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><fingerprint>beb11a5a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/45-c?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ray, L.

Investigating cerebral metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at a microscopic level is essential for understanding brain function and its pathological alterations. The intricate signaling and metabolic dynamics between neurons, glia, and microvasculature requires much more detailed understanding to better comprehend the mechanisms governing brain function and its disease-related changes. We recently demonstrated that pharmacologically-induced alterations to different steps of cerebral metabolism can be distinguished utilizing 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we evaluate the ability of the phasor analysis method to identify these pharmacological metabolic alterations and compare the method’s performance with more conventional nonlinear curve-fitting analysis. Visualization of phasor data, both at the fundamental laser repetition frequency and its second harmonic, enables resolution of pharmacologically-induced alterations to mitochondrial metabolic processes from baseline cerebral metabolism. Compared to our previous classification models based on nonlinear curve-fitting, phasor–based models required fewer parameters and yielded comparable or improved classification accuracy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and phasor analysis shows utility for detecting metabolic alterations and will lead to a deeper understanding of cerebral energetics and its pathological changes.</content></content><author><name>Carlos A.

The overall survival (OS) of patients with ovarian cancer is poor while epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinico-pathologic characteristics, especially the prognostic factors, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Taiwan. Information about newly diagnosed patients with EOC from 2009 to 2012 was retrieved from the database of the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Data from 2009 to 2013 for the respective cases from the claims database of Taiwan’s National Health Insurance and National Death Registry were then retrieved. Potential prognostic factors were analyzed. The mean age at diagnosis of the 2,498 patients was 52.8 years. Serous carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma were diagnosed in 43.3% and 22.8% of the total patients, respectively. For patients with early-stage disease, taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage I, and younger age at diagnosis led to better overall survival (p = 0.030, p = 0.002, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively) in multivariable analysis. For advanced-stage patients, histology (endometrioid type), taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy, stage, and age at diagnosis had a significant impact on OS (p&amp;lt;0.001, p = 0.020, p&amp;lt;0.001, p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). In conclusion, taxane-based chemotherapy impacts the outcome of patients with EOC.

Plant mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) vary in sequence structure. We assembled the &lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; mtDNA using a mean coverage depth of 25X whole genome sequencing (WGS) and confirmed the presence of eight contigs/fragments by BLASTZ using the previously reported KJ820683 and AP012988 mtDNA as reference. Assembly of the mtDNA sequence reads resulted in a circular structure of 219,975 bp. Our assembled mtDNA, NCBI acc. no. KU831325, contained 34 protein-coding genes, 3 rRNA genes, and 19 tRNA genes with similarity to the KJ820683 and AP012988 reference mtDNA. No large repeats were found in the KU831325 assembly. However, KU831325 showed differences in the arrangement of bases at different regions compared to the previously reported mtDNAs. In the reference mtDNAs KJ820683 and AP012988, contig/fragment number 4 is partitioned into two contigs/fragments, 4a and 4b. However, contig/fragment number 4 was a single contig/fragment with 29,661 bp in KU831325. PCR and qRT-PCR using flanking markers from separate parts of contig/fragment number 4 confirmed it to be a single contig/fragment. In addition, genome re-alignment of the plastid genome and mtDNAs supported the presence of heteroplasmy and reverse arrangement of the heteroplasmic blocks within the other mtDNAs compared to KU831325 that might be one of the causal factors for its diversity. Our results thus confirm the existence of different mtDNAs in diverse &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oleracea&lt;/i&gt; subspecies.</content></content><author><name>Kiwoung Yang</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kiwoung Yang, Ujjal Kumar Nath, Manosh Kumar Biswas, Md Abdul Kayum, Go-eun Yi, Jonghoon Lee, Tae-Jin Yang, Ill-Sup Nou&lt;/p&gt;

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.390 to 0.525; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci.

Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus &lt;i&gt;Pilosocereus aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.390 to 0.525; &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (&lt;i&gt;trnT-trnL&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;psbD-trnT&lt;/i&gt;) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for this species. Our results showed that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt; is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureispinus&lt;/i&gt;, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Dynamic stability of nano-fibers self-assembled from short amphiphilic A6D peptides</title><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</link><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b47:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</originId><published>1522737999000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>54dbf27c</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019766?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><author><name>Narges Nikoofard</name></author><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>33</engagement><title>Diurnal transcriptome atlas of a primate across major neural and peripheral tissues</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/eaao0318?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d2514f:9f3b30f2</id><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/eaao0318.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/eaao0318?rss=1</originId><published>1521135592000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Cell Biology, Medicine, Diseases, Online Only</item></keywords><fingerprint>d1fa2c4d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/eaao0318?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Diurnal gene expression patterns underlie time-of-the-day–specific functional specialization of tissues.

Background &lt;p&gt;The HIV care cascade has improved in Latin America over the last decade. However, the influence of alcohol and noninjected drug use (NIDU) on cascade outcomes is mostly unknown.

Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated for the association of alcohol consumption and NIDU with retention in care by logistic regression; adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) were estimated for the associations with LTFU and VF by Cox regression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 3604 individuals, the proportions retained in care for one year were 84%, 79%, 72%, and 69% for patients reporting non-use, alcohol use, NIDU, and both alcohol and NIDU, respectively. For the same patient groups, the proportions LTFU over 18 months were 6%, 8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively. There were 1901 patients (53%) with HIV RNA results; VF proportions were similar between users and nonusers (ranging from 14–16%). After controlling for age, sex, study site, HIV transmission mode, time on ART, AIDS status, and CD4 count, neither alcohol use (aOR = 1.1, CI = 0.9–1.4; aHR = 1.0, CI = 0.8–1.3) nor NIDU (aOR = 1.3, CI = 0.9–1.8; aHR = 1.4, CI = 0.9–2.1) were significantly associated with retention or VF, respectively.

Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78). Afterwards, we assessed participants’ reports of avoidance and approach with regard to the character and their disposition to use maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that both PD and EC were positively related to maladaptive strategies and negatively related to adaptive strategies, and that the association between maladaptive regulation strategies (i.e., rumination) and the willingness to avoid the person in distress was mediated by reports of greater PD. This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</content></content><author><name>Delphine Grynberg</name></author><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Delphine Grynberg, Belén López-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have investigated the difference in bacterial contamination between conventional reused ventilator systems and disposable closed ventilator-suction systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial contamination rates of the reused and disposable ventilator systems, and the association between system disconnection and bacterial contamination of ventilator systems.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated patients used a conventional reused ventilator system and a disposable closed ventilator-suction system, respectively, for a week; specimens were then collected from the ventilator circuit systems to evaluate human and environmental bacterial contamination. The sputum specimens from patients were also analyzed in this study.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The detection rate of bacteria in the conventional reused ventilator system was substantially higher than that in the disposable ventilator system. The inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the disposable closed ventilator-suction system had higher bacterial concentrations than the conventional reused ventilator system. The bacterial concentration in the heated humidifier of the reused ventilator system was significantly higher than that in the disposable ventilator system.

Background &lt;p&gt;The etiology of transient corneal haze in premature infants is not known and how it relates to clinical outcomes in premature infants is not clear.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To study associated factors of transient corneal haze in premature infants.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective study of 261 premature infants from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening in the neonatal intensive care unit at a tertiary referral hospital. Characteristics of premature infants with and without corneal haze were analyzed by correlation tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regressions were used for statistical analyses. Associations between corneal haze and birth weight (BW), gestational age at birth (GA), central corneal thickness, intraocular pressure, and other systemic and ophthalmic data were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence of corneal haze was 13.4%. Lower BW, lower GA, packed red blood cells (RBC) transfusion, more days on oxygen, older maternal age, bronchopulmonary disease, and stage 3 ROP are associated with corneal haze. The severity of corneal haze decreased with infants’ postmenstrual age. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that BW and maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Low BW and older maternal age are the most important predictors of corneal haze in premature infants. Premature infants with corneal haze could carry more systemic and ocular morbidities. Hence they may require more clinical attention. Corneal haze is unlikely to hinder the treatment of ROP. However, it is possible that corneal haze could hinder the examination of ROP in some infants. If corneal haze does interfere with ROP screening, a closer, more conservative follow-up schedule with a senior ophthalmologist experienced in managing ROP is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yu-Hung Lai</name></author><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu-Hung Lai, Hsiu-Lin Chen, San-Nan Yang, Shun-Jen Chang, Lea-Yea Chuang, Wen-Chuan Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Assessment of researchers is necessary for decisions of hiring, promotion, and tenure. A burgeoning number of scientific leaders believe the current system of faculty incentives and rewards is misaligned with the needs of society and disconnected from the evidence about the causes of the reproducibility crisis and suboptimal quality of the scientific publication record. To address this issue, particularly for the clinical and life sciences, we convened a 22-member expert panel workshop in Washington, DC, in January 2017. Twenty-two academic leaders, funders, and scientists participated in the meeting. As background for the meeting, we completed a selective literature review of 22 key documents critiquing the current incentive system. From each document, we extracted how the authors perceived the problems of assessing science and scientists, the unintended consequences of maintaining the status quo for assessing scientists, and details of their proposed solutions. The resulting table was used as a seed for participant discussion. This resulted in six principles for assessing scientists and associated research and policy implications. We hope the content of this paper will serve as a basis for establishing best practices and redesigning the current approaches to assessing scientists by the many players involved in that process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oSr6VqA7_WQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>David Moher</name></author><crawled>1522346087236</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Moher, Florian Naudet, Ioana A.

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content></content><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

Scabin is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase enzyme and is a putative virulence factor produced by the plant pathogen, &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces scabies&lt;/i&gt;. Previously, crystal structures of Scabin were solved in the presence and absence of substrate analogues and inhibitors. Herein, experimental (hydrogen-deuterium exchange), simulated (molecular dynamics), and theoretical (Gaussian Network Modeling) approaches were systematically applied to study the dynamics of apo-Scabin in the context of a Scabin·NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;·DNA model. MD simulations revealed that the apo-Scabin solution conformation correlates well with the X-ray crystal structure, beyond the conformation of the exposed, mobile regions. In turn, the MD fluctuations correspond with the crystallographic B-factors, with the fluctuations derived from a Gaussian network model, and with the experimental H/D exchange rates. An Essential Dynamics Analysis identified the dynamic aspects of the toxin as a crab-claw-like mechanism of two topological domains, along with coupled deformations of exposed motifs. The “crab-claw” movement resembles the motion of C3-like toxins and emerges as a property of the central β scaffold of catalytic single domain toxins. The exposure and high mobility of the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; side motifs in the Scabin β-core suggest involvement in DNA substrate binding. A ternary Scabin·NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;·DNA model was produced via an independent docking methodology, where the intermolecular interactions correspond to the region of high mobility identified by dynamics analyses and agree with binding and kinetic data reported for wild-type and Scabin variants. Based on data for the Pierisin-like toxin group, the sequence motif R&lt;sub&gt;β1&lt;/sub&gt;–R&lt;sub&gt;La&lt;/sub&gt;–N&lt;sub&gt;Lc&lt;/sub&gt;–STT&lt;sub&gt;β2&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;PN&lt;/sub&gt;–W&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt;–(QxE)&lt;sub&gt;ARTT&lt;/sub&gt; emerges as a catalytic signature involved in the enzymatic activity of these DNA-acting toxins.

Polyploidization has played an important role in the evolution of vertebrates, particularly at the base of Teleostei–an enormously successful ray-finned fish group with additional genome doublings on lower taxonomic levels. The investigation of post-polyploid genome dynamics might provide important clues about the evolution and ecology of respective species and can help to decipher the role of polyploidy &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on speciation. Few studies have attempted to investigate the dynamics of repetitive DNA sequences in the post-polyploid genome using molecular cytogenetic tools in fishes, though recent efforts demonstrated their usefulness. The demonstrably monophyletic freshwater loach family Botiidae, branching to evolutionary diploid and tetraploid lineages separated &gt;25 Mya, offers a suited model group for comparing the long-term repetitive DNA evolution. For this, we integrated phylogenetic analyses with cytogenetical survey involving Giemsa- and Chromomycin A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/DAPI stainings and fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization with 5S/45S rDNA, U2 snDNA and telomeric probes in representative sample of 12 botiid species.
The karyotypes of all diploids were composed of 2n = 50 chromosomes, while majority of tetraploids had 2n = 4x = 100, with only subtle interspecific karyotype differences. The exceptional karyotype of &lt;i&gt;Botia dario&lt;/i&gt; (2n = 4x = 96) suggested centric fusions behind the 2n reduction. Variable patterns of FISH signals revealed cases of intraspecific polymorphisms, rDNA amplification, variable degree of correspondence with CMA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and almost no phylogenetic signal. In tetraploids, either additivity or loci gain/loss was recorded. Despite absence of classical interstitial telomeric sites, large blocks of interspersed rDNA/telomeric regions were found in diploids only.
We uncovered different molecular drives of studied repetitive DNA classes within botiid genomes as well as the advanced stage of the re-diploidization process in tetraploids. Our results may contribute to link genomic approach with molecular cytogenetic analyses in addressing the origin and mechanism of this polyploidization event.</content></content><author><name>Alexandr Sember</name></author><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alexandr Sember, Jörg Bohlen, Vendula Šlechtová, Marie Altmanová, Šárka Pelikánová, Petr Ráb&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts.

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</content></content><author><name>Sebastian E.

The purpose of this study was to explore the factors influencing low birth rate among married women using the National Survey data in Korea. We compared the different influences on women’s first and subsequent childbirths. This study was a secondary analysis using the “National Survey on Fertility and Family Health and Welfare”, which was a nationally representative survey conducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs. We analyzed the data of 3,482 married women (aged between 19 and 39 years) using SPSS 20.0 program for descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA, and binary and ordinal logistic regression models. The factors influencing women’s first childbirth included perceptions about the value of marriage and children and their education level. The factors influencing their subsequent childbirths included multifaceted variables of maternal age during the first childbirth, residential area, religion, monthly household income, perceptions about the value of marriage and children, and social media. It is necessary to improve women’s awareness and positive perceptions about marriage and children in order to increase the birth rate in Korea. Moreover, consistently providing financial and political support for maternal and childcare concerns and using social media to foster more positive attitudes toward having children may enhance birth rates in the future.</content></content><author><name>Ju-Eun Song</name></author><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ju-Eun Song, Jeong-Ah Ahn, Sun-Kyoung Lee, Eun Ha Roh&lt;/p&gt;

Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal plant disease that can cause significant losses in many crops. Some &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;Mildew resistance locus O&lt;/i&gt;) have proved to confer a durable resistance to powdery mildew in several species. Resistance granted by the &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; gene family members has prompted an increasing interest in characterizing these genes and implementing their use in plant breeding. Lentil (&lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt; Medik.) is a widely grown food legume almost exclusively consumed as dry seed with an average world production of 4.5 million tons. Powdery mildew causes severe losses on certain lentil cultivars under particular environmental conditions. Data mining of the lentil CDC Redberry draft genome allowed to identify up to 15 gene sequences with homology to known &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes, designated as &lt;i&gt;LcMLOs&lt;/i&gt;. Further characterization of these gene sequences and their deduced protein sequences demonstrated conformity with key MLO protein characteristics such as the presence of transmembrane and calmodulin binding domains, as well as that of other conserved motifs. Phylogenetic and other comparative analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt; are the most likely gene orthologs related to powdery mildew response in other species, sharing a high similarity with other known resistance genes of dicot species, such as pea &lt;i&gt;PsMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula MtMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MtMLO3&lt;/i&gt;. Sets of primers were designed as tools to PCR amplify the genomic sequences of &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt;, also to screen lentil germplasm in search of resistance mutants. Primers were used to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes in all of the six wild lentil relatives. Respective to each gene, all &lt;i&gt;Lens&lt;/i&gt; sequences shared a high similarity. Likewise, we used these primers to screen a working collection of 58 cultivated and 23 wild lentil accessions in search of length polymorphisms present in these two genes. All these data widen the insights on this gene family and can be useful for breeding programs in lentil and close related species.</content></content><author><name>Carlos Polanco</name></author><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Polanco, Luis E.

This study asks the question on which national “shoulders” the world’s top-level research stands. Traditionally, the number of citations to national papers has been the evaluative measures of national scientific standings. We raise a different question: instead of analyzing the citations to a countries’ articles (the forward view), we examine references to prior publications from specific countries cited in the most elite publications (the backward—citing—view). “Elite publications” are operationalized as the top-1% most-highly cited articles. Using the articles published from 2004 to 2013, we examine the research referenced in these works. Our results confirm the well-known fact that China has emerged to become a major player in science. However, China still belongs to the low contributors when countries are ranked as contributors to the cited references in top-1% articles. Using this perspective, the results do not support a decreasing trend for the USA; in fact, the USA exceeds expectations (compared to its publication share) in terms of references in the top-1% articles. Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands also appear at the top of the list. However, the results for Germany are lower than statistically expected.</content></content><author><name>Lutz Bornmann</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lutz Bornmann, Caroline Wagner, Loet Leydesdorff&lt;/p&gt;

A key focus of the racing industry is to reduce the number of race-day events where horses die suddenly or are euthanased due to catastrophic injury. The objective of this study was therefore to determine risk factors for race-day fatalities in Thoroughbred racehorses, using a cohort of all horses participating in flat racing in Great Britain between 2000 and 2013. Horse-, race- and course-level data were collected and combined with all race-day fatalities, recorded by racecourse veterinarians in a central database. Associations between exposure variables and fatality were assessed using logistic regression analyses for (1) all starts in the dataset and (2) starts made on turf surfaces only. There were 806,764 starts in total, of which 548,571 were on turf surfaces. A total of 610 fatalities were recorded; 377 (61.8%) on turf. In both regression models, increased firmness of the going, increasing racing distance, increasing average horse performance, first year of racing and wearing eye cover for the first time all increased the odds of fatality. Generally, the odds of fatality also increased with increasing horse age whereas increasing number of previous starts reduced fatality odds. In the ‘all starts’ model, horses racing in an auction race were at 1.46 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–2.01) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. In the turf starts model, horses racing in Group 1 races were at 3.19 (95% CI 1.71–5.93) times the odds of fatality compared with horses not racing in this race type. Identification of novel risk factors including wearing eye cover and race type will help to inform strategies to further reduce the rate of fatality in flat racing horses, enhancing horse and jockey welfare and safety.</content></content><author><name>Sarah M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Heightened sexual risk in adolescence and young adulthood may be partially explained by deficits in executive functioning, the set of cognitive processes used to make reasoned decisions. However, the association between executive function and sexual risk is understudied among adolescent girls and young women, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort of 853 young women age 18–25 in rural Mpumalanga province, South Africa, we evaluated executive function with three non-verbal cognitive tests: I. a rule-finding test, II. a trail-making test, and III. a figure drawing test. Using log-binomial regression models, we estimated the association between lower executive function test scores and indicators of sexual risk (unprotected sex acts, concurrent partnerships, transactional sex, and recent HSV-2 infection).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In general, young women with lower executive function scores reported higher frequencies of sexual risk outcomes, though associations tended to be small with wide confidence intervals. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test I was associated with more unprotected sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.4 (1.0, 1.8)]. Testing in the lowest quintile of Test II was associated with more concurrent relationships and transactional sex [aPR (95% CI): 1.6 (1.1, 2.5) and 1.7 (1.3, 2.4), respectively], and testing in the lowest four quintiles of Test III was associated with more concurrent relationships [aPR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.0, 2.7)].&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate an association between low executive function and sexual risk in South African young women.

We describe the development and application of a suite of modular tools for high-resolution detection of proteins and intracellular protein complexes by electron microscopy (EM). Conditionally stable GFP- and mCherry-binding nanobodies (termed csGBP and csChBP, respectively) are characterized using a cell-free expression and analysis system and subsequently fused to an ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzyme. Expression of these cassettes alongside fluorescently labelled proteins results in recruitment and stabilisation of APEX, whereas unbound APEX nanobodies are efficiently degraded by the proteasome. This greatly simplifies correlative analyses, enables detection of less-abundant proteins, and eliminates the need to balance expression levels between fluorescently labelled and APEX nanobody proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this system to bimolecular complementation (‘EM split-fluorescent protein’), for localisation of protein–protein interactions at the ultrastructural level.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/mrmHIECypRw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nicholas Ariotti</name></author><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas Ariotti, James Rae, Nichole Giles, Nick Martel, Emma Sierecki, Yann Gambin, Thomas E.

In particular the universal enrichment of negative charge and the larger than average SES area for a polar atom on the surface of a water-soluble protein suggest that from a protein-solvent interaction perspective to fold into a native state is to optimize the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between solvent molecules and the surface polar atoms of a protein rather than to only minimize its apolar surface area.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03301-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>Sensitive and frequent identification of high avidity neo-epitope specific CD8 + T cells in immunotherapy-naive ovarian cancer</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03301-0</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_16229332b32:98b635:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03301-0</originId><published>1521097200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>85c41093</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/4yzrKIsgvlU/s41467-018-03301-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sensitive and frequent identification of high avidity neo-epitope specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;

Heparan sulfate 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfotransferases (HS3STs) catalyze the final maturation step of heparan sulfates. Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biological processes have been described to be influenced by 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated motifs. A conflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 may exhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on the model used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare the consequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellular model. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhanced the proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, the colony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by the expression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between the three isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had the same functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt and NF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In line with these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant to cell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activity and support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss of their expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/or changes in the tumor environment.</content></content><author><name>Charles Hellec</name></author><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Hellec, Maxime Delos, Mathieu Carpentier, Agnès Denys, Fabrice Allain&lt;/p&gt;

The substitution of fish resources as ingredients for aquafeeds by those based on vegetable sources is needed to ensure aquaculture sustainability in the future. It is known that Senegalese sole (&lt;i&gt;Solea senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;) accepts high dietary content of plant ingredients without altering growth or flesh quality parameters. However, scarce information is available regarding the long-term impact of vegetable diets (combining the inclusion of both vegetable protein and oils) on the stress response and immunity of this fish species. This study aims to evaluate the concomitant effect of the extended use of vegetable protein-based diets with fish oil (FO) replacement (0, 50 or 100%) by vegetable oils (VO), on the response to acute (10 min) or prolonged (4 days) stress, induced by thermal shock. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose and lactate as well as hepatic levels of glucose, glycogen and lactate were evaluated as primary and secondary responses to stress, 6 and 18 months after feeding the experimental diets (6 and 18 MAF). The brain monoaminergic activity in telencephalon and hypothalamus, and non-specific immune parameters were also evaluated. As expected, thermal shock induced an increase in values of plasma parameters related to stress, which was more evident in acute than in prolonged stress. Stress also affected lactate levels in the liver and the values of the alternative complement pathway-ACH50 in the plasma. Dietary substitution of FO induced an effect &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; on some parameters such as decreased hepatic glucose and glycogen levels and peroxidase activity in plasma as well enhanced serotonergic activity in brain of non-stressed fish. The results obtained in some parameters indicate that there is an interaction between the use of vegetable diets with the physiological response to thermal stress, as is the case of the hepatic lactate, serotonergic neurotransmission in brain, and the activity of ACH50 in plasma. These results suggest that the inclusion of VO in plant protein based diets point to a slightly inhibited stress response, more evident for an acute than a prolonged stress.</content></content><author><name>Marta Conde-Sieira</name></author><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Conde-Sieira, Manuel Gesto, Sónia Batista, Fátima Linares, José L.

Conclusion: This work initiates a class of probabilistic evolution models that jointly model the genomes and the epigenomes, thus helps to bring evolutionary principles to comparative epigenomic studies.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00340</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><title>[ASAP] Gut Microbiota: Rational Manipulation of Gut Bacterial Metalloenzymes Provides Insights into Dysbiosis and Inflammation</title><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00340</link><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_162b05f3579:46c0d1:76251cdd</id><visual><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00340/20180409/images/medium/bi-2018-00340d_0002.gif</url><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>112</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00340</originId><crawled>1523377452409</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f26179e9</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00340/20180409/images/medium/bi-2018-00340d_0002.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00340&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Swarm-founding ‘Warrior wasps’ (&lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are found throughout the tropical regions of South America, are much feared due to their aggressive nest defence and painful sting. There are only five species of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt;, all construct distinctive nests that consist of a single sessile comb built onto the surface of a tree or rock face, which is covered by a ribbed envelope. Although locally common, research into this group is just starting. We studied eight colonies of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca septentrionalis&lt;/i&gt;, a species recently been described from Brazil. A new colony is established by a swarm of 52 to 140 adults that constructs a colony containing around 200 brood cells. The largest colony collected containing 865 adults and over 1400 cells. The number of queen’s present among the eight colonies varied between 3 and 58 and no clear association between colony development and queen number was detected. Workers and queens were morphologically indistinguishably, but differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons were detected, particularly in their (Z)-9-alkenes. The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps.</content></content><author><name>Eliaber B.

The occurrence of water stress during wheat growth is more frequent due to climate change. Three experiments (cyclic drought, cyclic waterlogging, and cyclic drought plus waterlogging) were conducted to investigate the effects of mild and severe cyclic/single water stress at elongation and heading stages on winter wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.) yield. The effect of either mild drought at elongation or mild waterlogging at heading on wheat yield was not significant; however, significance did occur under other single water stresses. As the stress becomes more severe, the yield loss significantly increases. Extreme drought/waterlogging treatment at elongation caused a greater yield penalty than stress at heading stage. Except the combination of mild drought and mild waterlogging treatment, cyclic water stress significantly decreased wheat yields. The decrease in wheat yield under cyclic severe drought and waterlogging was significantly higher than any other treatment, with percentage decreases of 71.52 and 73.51%, respectively. In general, a yield reduction from mild cyclic water stress did not indicate more severe damage than single treatments; in contrast, grain yield suffered more when water stress occurred again after severe drought and waterlogging. Drought during elongation significantly decreased kernel number, whereas drought at heading/waterlogging during elongation and heading decreased the spike weight, which might be the main reason for the yield penalty. Furthermore, water stress caused variation in the decrease of total biomass and/or harvest index. The present study indicates comprehensive understanding of the types, degree, and stages of water stress are essential for assessing the impact of multiple water stresses on wheat yield.</content></content><author><name>Jinfeng Ding</name></author><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinfeng Ding, Zhengjin Huang, Min Zhu, Chunyan Li, Xinkai Zhu, Wenshan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nicholas R.

These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>55</engagement><title>The role of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in control of the intestinal stem-cell niche</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1626bec6ec5:6955ddd:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-03638-6/MediaObjects/41467_2018_3638_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>515</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6</originId><published>1522220400000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>33955691</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/f9TKj1_qJc4/s41467-018-03638-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The role of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in control of the intestinal stem-cell niche&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in control of the intestinal stem-cell niche, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03638-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03638-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Colony stimulating factor 1 controls the growth and differentiation of macrophages.

Penile acquisition of HIV infection contributes substantially to the global epidemic. Our goal was to establish a preclinical macaque model of penile HIV infection for evaluating the efficacy of new HIV prevention modalities. Rhesus macaques were challenged once or twice weekly with consistent doses of SHIV&lt;sub&gt;sf&lt;/sub&gt;162P3 (a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus containing HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 4–600 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50% tissue culture infective dose), via two penile routes, until systemic SHIV infection was confirmed. One route exposed the inner foreskin, glans and urethral os to virus following deposition into the prepuce (foreskin) pouch. The second route introduced the virus non-traumatically into the distal urethra only. Single-route challenges resulted in dose-dependent rates of SHIV acquisition informing selection of optimal SHIV dosing. Concurrent SHIV challenges via the prepuce pouch (200 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and urethra (16 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in infection of 100% (10/10) animals following a median of 2.5 virus exposures (range, 1–12). We describe the first rhesus macaque repeat-exposure SHIV challenge model of penile HIV acquisition. Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</content></content><author><name>David A.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</content></content><author><name>Mei-Yao Wu</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire.</content></content><author><name>Inam Yekwayo</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs. However, the quality of available evidence remains limited for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Youri Yordanov</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youri Yordanov, Agnes Dechartres, Philippe Ravaud&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications. Sensitisation of patients and caregivers during admission on the implication of non-adherence, as well as interventions that monitor and provide feedback mechanisms on patients’ medication taking behaviour holds promise for maximising diabetes and hypertensive medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Roger A.

There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (&lt;i&gt;Elaeis guineensis&lt;/i&gt; Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS&lt;sup&gt;E&lt;/sup&gt;) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</content></content><author><name>Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento</name></author><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sidney Vasconcelos do Nascimento, Marcelo Murad Magalhães, Roberto Lisboa Cunha, Paulo Henrique de Oliveira Costa, Ronnie Cley de Oliveira Alves, Guilherme Corrêa de Oliveira, Rafael Borges da Silva Valadares&lt;/p&gt;

These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>DIMEdb: an integrated database and web service for metabolite identification in direct infusion mass spectrometery [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v1?rss=1</link><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16275d1334f:76e294b:7d6c1c1c</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/291799</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><fingerprint>203682a4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291799v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Metabolomics involves the characterisation, identification, and quantification of small molecules (metabolites) that act as the reaction intermediates of biological processes.

The speed of theta brain oscillatory activity is thought to play a key role in determining working memory (WM) capacity. Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (&gt;30 Hz) can be nested into a theta wave. Gamma cycles are thought to represent single memory items; therefore, this interplay could determine individual memory capacity. We directly tested this hypothesis by means of parietal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) set at slower (4 Hz) and faster (7 Hz) theta frequencies during a visuospatial WM paradigm. Accordingly, we found that 4-Hz tACS enhanced WM capacity, while 7-Hz tACS reduced WM capacity. Notably, these effects were found only for items presented to the hemifield contralateral to the stimulation site. This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Nina Wolinski</name></author><crawled>1521049595242</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nina Wolinski, Nicholas R.

This provides causal evidence for a frequency-dependent and spatially specific organization of WM storage, supporting the theta–gamma phase coupling theory of WM capacity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CD9CmLoVDB8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>BEL Commons: an environment for exploration and analysis of networks encoded in Biological Expression Language [NEW RESULTS]</title><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</link><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16277c65b0a:7becc8a:9f3b30f2</id><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/288274</canonicalUrl><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</originId><published>1522393200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><fingerprint>a71d9f61</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288274v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The rapid accumulation of knowledge in the field of systems and networks biology during recent years requires complex, but user-friendly and accessible web services that allow from visualization to complex algorithmic analysis.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common disease of cattle and wildlife, with economic repercussions and implications for animal and human health. The surveillance of bTB in wildlife is particularly important, to shed light on the epidemiological role of wild species and for the adaptation of control measures. In France, a bTB surveillance system for free-ranging wildlife, the Sylvatub system, was launched in 2011 on wild boars, red deer, roe deer and badgers. It relies on active and passive surveillance activities, constrained by practical difficulties, such as the accessibility of wild animals, and regulatory rules for the trapping of badgers, for example. We report here the first assessment of stakeholders’ perceptions of the Sylvatub system and its acceptability, based on 20 individual semi-structured interviews with three types of stakeholder (collectors, coordinators, officers) in areas with different rates of bTB infection. With the caveat that these findings cannot be assumed to be representative of the national situation, we found that the Sylvatub system was considered useful by all the stakeholders interviewed. Those from the world of hunting participate in surveillance mostly to help livestock farmers, who are not systematically involved in bTB surveillance in wildlife. Many practical and regulatory constraints were raised, which could be offset by recognition of the work done by the “hunting community”, to maintain the willingness of these individuals to participate. We also identified a need for improvements in communication and information. Qualitative information, such as that collected here, is essential to improve our understanding of the reasons favoring and disfavoring participation in surveillance, and should be taken into account in the evaluation process. These results are relevant to hunters and to veterinary authorities wishing to identify the determinants of participation in the Sylvatub system. They could provide support for decision-making processes to improve surveillance strategies.</content></content><author><name>Julie Rivière</name></author><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julie Rivière, Yann Le Strat, Pascal Hendrikx, Barbara Dufour&lt;/p&gt;

Foot and mouth disease (FMD) has devastated the cattle industry in Sri Lanka many times in the past. Despite its seriousness, limited attempts have been made to understand the disease to ameliorate its effects–current recommendation for vaccines being based solely on immunological assessments rather than on molecular identification. The general belief is that the cattle population in Sri Lanka acquired the FMD virus (FMDV) strains via introductions from India. However, there could be endemic FMDV lineages circulating in Sri Lanka. To infer the phylogenetic relationships of the FMDV strains in the island, we sequenced the VP1 genomic region of the virus isolates collected during the 2014 outbreak together with a few reported cases in 2012 and 1997 and compared them to VP1 sequences from South Asia. The FMDV strains collected in the 2014 outbreak belonged to the lineage, Ind-2001d, of the topotype, ME-SA. The strains collected in 2012 and 1997 belonged to another lineage called &apos;unnamed&apos; by the World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). Based on the present analysis, we designate the lineage &apos;unnamed&apos; as Srl-97 which we found endemic to Sri Lanka. The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</content></content><author><name>S.

The evolutionary rates of Srl-97 and Ind-2001d in Sri Lanka were estimated to be 0.0004 and 0.0046 substitutions/site/year, respectively, suggesting that Srl-97 evolves slowly.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Palladium and platinum 2,4-cis-amino azetidine and related complexes</title><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</link><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1629c8e89f0:4bf8b1:923c4a60</id><visual><url>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-chemrxiv-7984736271254/10998107/thumb.png</url><width>250</width><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>354</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</originId><crawled>1523045009904</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><fingerprint>e4f0a9d5</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Crystal structures and structural interpretation of complexes of azetidine (and related) ligands coordinated to palladium(II) and platinum(II).</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Palladium_and_platinum_2_4-cis-amino_azetidine_and_related_complexes/6104054</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><engagementRate>0.09</engagementRate><published>1522972800000</published><description>Crystal structures and structural interpretation of complexes of azetidine (and related) ligands coordinated to palladium(II) and platinum(II).</description></item><item><engagement>92</engagement><title>LRRK2 kinase in Parkinson&apos;s disease</title><engagementRate>1.7</engagementRate><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529853:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/36.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/36?rss=1</originId><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/36?rss=1</link><fingerprint>8e58b8b2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/36?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Alessi, D.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, where burden, impact, and incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the highest in the world, conversely, the epidemiology of influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is incompletely known. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of influenza-associated SARI in hospitalized children in Maputo city, Mozambique. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children aged 0–14 years old who met the case definition for SARI in two hospitals in Maputo city after their parents or legal representative consented to participate. A structured questionnaire was used to collect clinical and demographic data. Typing and subtyping of influenza were performed by real-time PCR. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 2,007 eligible children were recruited, of whom 1,997 (99.5%) were screened for influenza by real-time PCR. The median age of participants was 16.9 months (IQR: 7.0–38.9 months) and 53.9% (1076/1991) were male. A total of 77 were positive for influenza, yielding a frequency of 3.9% (77/1,991), with the highest frequency being reported in the age group 1–5 years old. Cases of influenza peaked twice each year, during which, its frequency reached up to 60%-80%. Among all influenza confirmed cases, 33.7% (26/77), 35.1% (27/77) and 28.6% (22/77) were typed as influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09, and B, respectively. This represents the first report of influenza in urban/sub urban setting in Mozambique and the first evidence of distribution of strains of influenza in the country. Our data showed that frequency of influenza was lower than reported in a rural setting in Mozambique and the frequency of seasonal (A/H1N1pdm09) and (A/H3N2) subtypes were similar in children with SARI.</content></content><author><name>Neuza Nguenha</name></author><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Nguenha, Almiro Tivane, Mirela Pale, Loira Machalele, Afonso Nacoto, Germano Pires, Edirsse Mationane, Judite Salência, Félix Gundane, Délcio Muteto, Josina Chilundo, Sandra Mavale, Noorbebi Adamo, Cynthia Semá-Baltazar, Orvalho Augusto, Eduardo Gudo, Tufária Mussá&lt;/p&gt;

Numerous peripheral tissues possess self-sustaining daily biologic rhythms that are regulated at the molecular level by clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt;. Physiological function of nasal mucosa exhibits rhythmic variability to a day-night environmental cycle. Nevertheless, little is known of the expression and distribution pattern of clock genes in nasal mucosa. The present study investigates the expression level and distribution pattern of &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; genes in nasal mucosa of healthy controls, allergic rhinitis patients, and normal rats. In human and rat nasal mucosa, the levels of these genes are asymmetrically expressed in nasal mucosa derived from right and left cavities in normal controls, allergic patients, and rat. In human nasal mucosa, the expression levels of these genes were higher in the decongested side than the congested mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, these clock genes are expressed in a rhythmic circadian manner under the regular light/dark cycles. The expression levels of MUC5AC, a key mucin genes produced in superficial epithelium, are higher in decongested side than that congested side in human nasal mucosa. In rat nasal mucosa, MUC5AC levels showed a circadian rhythm which was associated with different expression levels in nasal mucosa derived from the right and left nasal cavities. Taken together with these results, the present study shows that the clock genes such as &lt;i&gt;PER1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PER2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CLOCK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;and BMAL1&lt;/i&gt; are present in human and rat nasal mucosa, and suggest that these clock genes may control the pathophysiological function of nasal mucosa as circadian oscillators and affect the maintenance of the nasal cycle.</content></content><author><name>Ha Kyun Kim</name></author><published>1520974800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ha Kyun Kim, Hyun Jung Kim, Jae Hyung Kim, Tae Hoon Kim, Sang Hag Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Western Alaska is a potential point-of-entry for foreign-origin influenza A viruses (IAVs) into North America via migratory birds. We sampled waterfowl and gulls for IAVs at Izembek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in western Alaska, USA, during late summer and autumn months of 2011–2015, to evaluate the abundance and diversity of viruses at this site. We collected 4842 samples across five years from 25 species of wild birds resulting in the recovery, isolation, and sequencing of 172 IAVs. With the intent of optimizing sampling efficiencies, we used information derived from this multi-year effort to: 1) evaluate from which species we consistently recover viruses, 2) describe viral subtypes of isolates by host species and year, 3) characterize viral gene segment sequence diversity with respect to host species, and assess potential differences in the viral lineages among the host groups, and 4) examine how evidence of intercontinental exchange of IAVs relates to host species. We consistently recovered viruses from dabbling ducks (&lt;i&gt;Anas spp&lt;/i&gt;.), emperor geese (&lt;i&gt;Chen canagica&lt;/i&gt;) and glaucous-winged gulls (&lt;i&gt;Larus glaucescens&lt;/i&gt;). There was little evidence for differences in viral subtypes and diversity from different waterfowl hosts, however subtypes and viral diversity varied between waterfowl host groups and glaucous-winged gulls. Furthermore, higher proportions of viral sequences from northern pintails (&lt;i&gt;Anas acuta&lt;/i&gt;), emperor geese and glaucous-winged gulls were grouped in phylogenetic clades that included IAV sequences originating from wild birds sampled in Asia as compared to non-pintail dabbling ducks, a difference that may be related to intercontinental migratory tendencies of host species. Our summary of research and surveillance efforts at Izembek NWR will assist in future prioritization of which hosts to sample and swab types to collect in Alaska and elsewhere in order to maximize isolate recovery, subtype and sequence diversity for resultant viruses, and detection of evidence for intercontinental viral exchange.</content></content><author><name>Andrew B.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Following its publication in 2008, the Global Nutritional Index (GNI) which captures the triple burden of malnutrition, has been updated to assess the overall nutritional status and nutritional trends of countries, regions and the world, including both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The GNI was modeled on the Human Development Index, using geometric means of three normalized indicators: protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from PEM), micronutrient deficiency (MID, measured by DALYs from MID), and penalizing obesity (percent female obesity).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Following its publication in 2008, the Global Nutritional Index (GNI) which captures the triple burden of malnutrition, has been updated to assess the overall nutritional status and nutritional trends of countries, regions and the world, including both under-nutrition and over-nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The GNI was modeled on the Human Development Index, using geometric means of three normalized indicators: protein-energy malnutrition (PEM, measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from PEM), micronutrient deficiency (MID, measured by DALYs from MID), and penalizing obesity (percent female obesity). GNI (range 0–1) was calculated from 1990–2015 for 186 countries, in seven World Bank income and WHO region groupings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;World GNI increased from 0.433 to 0.473 as decreased deficits overcompensated for the rise in obesity. GNI for African low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (median 0.301 to 0.392) and South-East Asian LMIC (0.456 to 0.564) improved significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), while for high-income countries (0.657 to 0.611) worsened significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content></content><author><name>Oswaldo Santos Baquero</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;

In addition to pure single-precision calculations, our implementation allows one to follow a single-precision calculation by clean-up iterations, fully recovering double-precision results while retaining significant savings.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Embryonic background risk promotes the survival of tadpoles facing surface predators</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087da:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1521666000000</updated><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</originId><published>1521666000000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>9fd2586d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193939</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Adam L.

Exposure to intense predation risk can induce morphological and behavioural phenotypes that prepare prey, often at young ages, for surviving attacks from unknown predators. However, previous studies revealed that this survival advantage depended on the predator species. Here, we used alarm cues from injured conspecifics to simulate a period of high predation risk for embryonic wood frogs, &lt;i&gt;Lithobates sylvaticus&lt;/i&gt;. Two weeks post-hatching, we tested whether the embryonic risk exposure influenced survival in encounters with two novel predators: (1) a spider (&lt;i&gt;Dolomedes&lt;/i&gt; sp.) that ambushes prey exclusively on the surface of the water, and (2) the adult predacious diving beetle (&lt;i&gt;Dytiscus&lt;/i&gt; sp.) which displays underwater sit-and-wait posture and pursuit tactics. Tadpoles exposed to embryonic high-risk survived longer when encountering spiders, whereas background risk had no influence on survival with adult beetles. These findings, coupled with survival studies involving other predator types, indicate that a high-risk environment promotes tadpole survival in future encounters with unknown sit-and-wait predators, but at the cost of increased vulnerability to novel predators capable of active pursuit.</content></content><author><name>Adam L.

Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based high-performance accelerometers are ubiquitously used in various electronic devices. However, there is an existing need to detect physical impacts using low-cost devices with no electronic circuits or a battery. We designed and fabricated an impact sensor prototype using a commercial stereolithography apparatus that only consists of a plastic housing and working fluids. The sensor device responds to the instantaneous acceleration (impact) by deformation and pinch off of a water droplet that is suspended in oil in a sensor cavity. We tested the various geometrical and physical parameters of the impact sensor to identify their relations to threshold acceleration values. We show that the state diagram that is plotted against the dimensionless Archimedes and Bond numbers adequately describes the response of the proposed sensor.</content></content><author><name>Daigo Takahashi</name></author><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daigo Takahashi, Keisuke Hara, Taiji Okano, Hiroaki Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis (TB) is a granulomatous disease that has affected humanity for thousands of years. The production of cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, is fundamental in the formation and maintenance of granulomas and in the control of the disease. Recently, the introduction of TNF-α-blocking monoclonal antibodies, such as Infliximab, has brought improvements in the treatment of patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, but this treatment also increases the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis. Our objective was to analyze, in an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; model, the influence of Infliximab on the granulomatous reactions and on the production of antigen-specific cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-10 and IL-17) from beads sensitized with soluble Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) antigens cultured in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from TB patients. We evaluated 76 individuals, with tuberculosis active, treated and subjects with positive PPD. Granuloma formation was induced in the presence or absence of Infliximab for up to 10 days. The use of Infliximab in cultures significantly blocked TNF-α production (p &amp;lt;0.05), and led to significant changes in granuloma structure, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, only in the treated TB group. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in the levels of IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-10 and IL-17 after TNF-α blockade in the three experimental groups (p &amp;lt;0.05). Taken together, our results demonstrate that TNF-α blockade by Infliximab directly influenced the structure of granuloma only in the treated TB group, but negatively modulated the production of Th1, Th17 and regulatory T cytokines in the three groups analyzed.</content></content><author><name>Djalma A.

Landscape connectivity is integral to the persistence of metapopulations of wide ranging carnivores and other terrestrial species. The objectives of this research were to investigate the landscape characteristics essential to use of areas by lynx and bobcats in northern New England, map a habitat availability model for each species, and explore connectivity across areas of the region likely to experience future development pressure. A Mahalanobis distance analysis was conducted on location data collected between 2005 and 2010 from 16 bobcats in western Vermont and 31 lynx in northern Maine to determine which variables were most consistent across all locations for each species using three scales based on average 1) local (15 minute) movement, 2) linear distance between daily locations, and 3) female home range size. The bobcat model providing the widest separation between used locations and random study area locations suggests that they cue into landscape features such as edge, availability of cover, and development density at different scales. The lynx model with the widest separation between random and used locations contained five variables including natural habitat, cover, and elevation—all at different scales. Shrub scrub habitat—where lynx’s preferred prey is most abundant—was represented at the daily distance moved scale. Cross validation indicated that outliers had little effect on models for either species. A habitat suitability value was calculated for each 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; pixel across Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine for each species and used to map connectivity between conserved lands within selected areas across the region. Projections of future landscape change illustrated potential impacts of anthropogenic development on areas lynx and bobcat may use, and indicated where connectivity for bobcats and lynx may be lost. These projections provided a guide for conservation of landscape permeability for lynx, bobcat, and species relying on similar habitats in the region.</content></content><author><name>Laura E.

Most weakly electric fish navigate and communicate by sensing electric signals generated by their muscle-derived electric organs. Adults of one lineage (Apteronotidae), which discharge their electric organs in excess of 1 kHz, instead have an electric organ derived from the axons of specialized spinal neurons (electromotorneurons [EMNs]). EMNs fire spontaneously and are the fastest-firing neurons known. This biophysically extreme phenotype depends upon a persistent sodium current, the molecular underpinnings of which remain unknown. We show that a skeletal muscle–specific sodium channel gene duplicated in this lineage and, within approximately 2 million years, began expressing in the spinal cord, a novel site of expression for this isoform. Concurrently, amino acid replacements that cause a persistent sodium current accumulated in the regions of the channel underlying inactivation. Therefore, a novel adaptation allowing extreme neuronal firing arose from the duplication, change in expression, and rapid sequence evolution of a muscle-expressing sodium channel gene.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/pubkd-zrN1g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ammon Thompson</name></author><crawled>1522172502480</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ammon Thompson, Daniel T.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</content></content><author><name>Benjamin J.

Availability of the network allowed prediction of drug response in individual samples, including accurate prediction of synergistic EGFR and c-MET inhibitor activity in cells lacking mutations in either gene, which was experimentally validated, thus contributing to current precision oncology efforts.</description></item><item><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22942-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>25</engagement><title>Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22942-1</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162293e62b1:9b02c4:34f43e70</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-22942-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_22942_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>381</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22942-1</originId><published>1521097200000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><fingerprint>52ea747</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/XTa-qbxTgZo/s41598-018-22942-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22942-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22942-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XTa-qbxTgZo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><author><name>Stefan Elmer</name></author><crawled>1521110377137</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22942-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22942-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Theta Coherence Asymmetry in the Dorsal Stream of Musicians Facilitates Word Learning&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/XTa-qbxTgZo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><engagement>5</engagement><title>Convergence of marine megafauna movement patterns in coastal and open oceans [Ecology]</title><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3072.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16244b15922:306b6b9:34f43e70</id><visual><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/12.cover-source.jpg?itok=TO5q5WLS</url><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>480</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><unread>False</unread><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3072.short?rss=1</originId><published>1521567125000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3072</canonicalUrl><fingerprint>15c03034</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3072.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The extent of increasing anthropogenic impacts on large marine vertebrates partly depends on the animals’ movement patterns.

The current work examined the unique contribution that autistic traits and social anxiety have on tasks examining attention and emotion processing. In Study 1, 119 typically-developing college students completed a flanker task assessing the control of attention to target faces and away from distracting faces during emotion identification. In Study 2, 208 typically-developing college students performed a visual search task which required identification of whether a series of 8 or 16 emotional faces depicted the same or different emotions. Participants with more self-reported autistic traits performed more slowly on the flanker task in Study 1 than those with fewer autistic traits when stimuli depicted complex emotions. In Study 2, participants higher in social anxiety performed less accurately on trials showing all complex faces; participants with autistic traits showed no differences. These studies suggest that traits related to autism and to social anxiety differentially impact social cognitive processing.</content></content><author><name>Cheryl L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Endothelial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of many rheumatic diseases, typified by vascular inflammation and damage. Immunosuppressive drugs induce disease remission and lead to improved patient survival. However, there remains a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease in these patients even after adequate disease control. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of mycophenolic acid (MPA), a commonly used immunosuppressive drug in rheumatology, on blood vessel or circulating endothelial colony forming cell number and function.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We tested whether mycophenolic acid exerts an inhibitory effect on proliferation, clonogenic potential and vasculogenic function of endothelial colony forming cell. We also studied potential mechanisms involved in the observed effects.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Treatment with MPA decreased endothelial colony forming cell proliferation, clonogenic potential and vasculogenic function in a dose-dependent fashion. MPA increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression, p21 gene expression and p53 phosphorylation, indicative of activation of cellular senescence. Exogenous guanosine supplementation rescued diminished endothelial colony forming cell proliferation and indices of senescence, consistent with the known mechanism of action of MPA.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings show that clinically relevant doses of MPA have potent anti-angiogenic and pro-senescent effects on vascular precursor cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, thus indicating that treatment with MPA can potentially affect vascular repair and regeneration.

Background &lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypothermia is widely associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, but remains a pervasive global problem. No studies have examined the impact of hypothermia on outcomes for preterm infants treated with CPAP for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective analysis assessed the impact of hypothermia on outcomes of 65 neonates diagnosed with RDS and treated with either nasal oxygen (N = 17) or CPAP (N = 48) in a low-resource setting. A classification tree approach was used to develop a model predicting survival for subjects diagnosed with RDS.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Survival to discharge was accurately predicted based on three variables: mean temperature, treatment modality, and mean respiratory rate. None of the 23 neonates with a mean temperature during treatment below 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of treatment modality. Among neonates with a mean temperature exceeding 35.8°C, the survival rate was 100% for the 31 neonates treated with CPAP and 36.4% for the 11 neonates treated with nasal oxygen (p&amp;lt;0.001). For neonates treated with CPAP, outcomes were poor if more than 50% of measured temperatures indicated hypothermia (5.6% survival). In contrast, all 30 neonates treated with CPAP and with more than 50% of temperature measurements above 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of initial temperature.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results of our study suggest that successful implementation of CPAP to treat RDS in low-resource settings will require aggressive action to prevent persistent hypothermia. However, our results show that even babies who are initially cold can do well on CPAP with proper management of hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Jennifer Carns</name></author><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Carns, Kondwani Kawaza, MK Quinn, Yinsen Miao, Rudy Guerra, Elizabeth Molyneux, Maria Oden, Rebecca Richards-Kortum&lt;/p&gt;

Small-intestinal &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; populations in mice were unaffected by chronic and acute 18:2 exposure, yet harbored both 18:2- sensitive and resistant strains. This work shows that extant small intestinal lactobacilli are protected from toxic dietary components via the gut environment as well as their own capacity to evolve resistance.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Spatial clusters of gonorrhoea in England with particular reference to the outcome of partner notification: 2012 and 2013</title><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</link><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76927:7d6c1c1c</id><updated>1522702800000</updated><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</canonicalUrl><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</originId><published>1522702800000</published><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><fingerprint>86d9427a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195178</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;This study explored spatial-temporal variation in diagnoses of gonorrhoea to identify and quantify endemic areas and clusters in relation to patient characteristics and outcomes of partner notification (PN) across England, UK.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Endemic areas and clusters were identified using a two-stage analysis with Kulldorff’s scan statistics (SaTScan).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2,571,838 tests, 53,547 diagnoses were gonorrhoea positive (positivity = 2.08%). The proportion of diagnoses in heterosexual males was 1.5 times that in heterosexual females. Among index cases, men who have sex with men (MSM) were 8 times more likely to be diagnosed with gonorrhoea than heterosexual males (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). After controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and deprivation rank, 4 endemic areas were identified including 11,047 diagnoses, 86% of which occurred in London. 33 clusters included 17,629 diagnoses (34% of total diagnoses in 2012 and 2013) and spanned 21 locations, some of which were dominated by heterosexually acquired infection, whilst others were MSM focused. Of the 53,547 diagnoses, 14.5% (7,775) were the result of PN. The proportion of patients who attended services as a result of PN varied from 0% to 61% within different age, gender and sexual orientation cohorts. A third of tests resulting from PN were positive for gonorrhoea. 25% of Local Authorities (n = 81, 95% CI: 20.2, 29.5) had a higher than expected proportion for female PN diagnoses as compared to 16% for males (n = 52, 95% CI: 12.0, 19.9).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The English gonorrhoea epidemic is characterised by spatial-temporal variation. PN success varied between endemic areas and clusters. Greater emphasis should be placed on the role of PN in the control of gonorrhoea to reduce the risk of onward transmission, re-infection, and complications of infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Allen O’Brien</name></author><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Allen O’Brien, Ellie Sherrard-Smith, Bersabeh Sile, Charlotte Watts, Ian Simms&lt;/p&gt;

Time delays are known to play a crucial role in generating biological oscillations. The early embryonic cell cycle in the frog &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; is one such example. Although various mathematical models of this oscillating system exist, it is not clear how to best model the required time delay. Here, we study a simple cell cycle model that produces oscillations due to the presence of an ultrasensitive, time-delayed negative feedback loop. We implement the time delay in three qualitatively different ways, using a fixed time delay, a distribution of time delays, and a delay that is state-dependent. We analyze the dynamics in all cases, and we use experimental observations to interpret our results and put constraints on unknown parameters. In doing so, we find that different implementations of the time delay can have a large impact on the resulting oscillations.</content></content><author><name>Jan Rombouts</name></author><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jan Rombouts, Alexandra Vandervelde, Lendert Gelens&lt;/p&gt;

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures.

Amnion is a membrane surrounding the embryo/fetus which determine growth factors and interleukins with angiogenic, immunogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of conditioned culture medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion (hAM CCM) on migration and proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial primary cells (HUVECs), freshly isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNCs), and Jurkat leukemia cell line. Amnion membrane was freshly isolated from healthy placenta and its fragments cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to produce hAM CCM. Members of the IGFBP protein family made up one third of all assayed proteins present in the hAM medium. The hAM CCM did not affect the proliferation rate of HUVECs or MNCs, but we observed more intensive migration of those cells, and lower expression of CD31 surface antigen on HUVECs as compared to control cultures. In contrast, Jurkat cells did not respond to hAM CCM treatment by proliferation or mobility change. The conditioned medium from 24-h cultures of human amnion is easy to obtain and is a convenient source of various growth and other factors that may be useful in practical medicine.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>Go big or … don&apos;t?

Body size governs predator-prey interactions, which in turn structure populations, communities, and food webs. Understanding predator-prey size relationships is valuable from a theoretical perspective, in basic research, and for management applications. However, predator-prey size data are limited and costly to acquire. We quantified predator-prey total length and mass relationships for several freshwater piscivorous taxa: crappie (&lt;i&gt;Pomoxis&lt;/i&gt; spp.), largemouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus salmoides&lt;/i&gt;), muskellunge (&lt;i&gt;Esox masquinongy&lt;/i&gt;), northern pike (&lt;i&gt;Esox lucius&lt;/i&gt;), rock bass (&lt;i&gt;Ambloplites rupestris&lt;/i&gt;), smallmouth bass (&lt;i&gt;Micropterus dolomieu&lt;/i&gt;), and walleye (&lt;i&gt;Sander vitreus&lt;/i&gt;). The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm. A sensitivity analysis indicated estimates can be very accurate at sample sizes greater than 1,000 diet items and fairly accurate at sample sizes greater than 100. However, sample sizes less than 50 should be evaluated with caution. Furthermore, median log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; predator-prey body mass ratios ranged from 1.9–2.5, nearly 50% lower than values previously reported for freshwater fishes. Managers, researchers, and modelers could use our findings as a tool for numerous predator-prey evaluations from stocking size optimization to individual-based bioenergetics analyses identifying prey size structure.

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. conservation tillage, intensive &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (&lt;i&gt;Basidio&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Asco&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Zygo&lt;/i&gt;-, &lt;i&gt;Glomero&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/i&gt;), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while &lt;i&gt;Phoma&lt;/i&gt; displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the &lt;i&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/i&gt; (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).</content></content><author><name>Loreen Sommermann</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loreen Sommermann, Joerg Geistlinger, Daniel Wibberg, Annette Deubel, Jessica Zwanzig, Doreen Babin, Andreas Schlüter, Ingo Schellenberg&lt;/p&gt;

Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents’ behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.</content></content><author><name>Carolina Feher da Silva</name></author><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carolina Feher da Silva, Todd A.

Adherent cells sense the physical properties of their environment via focal adhesions. Improved understanding of how cells sense and response to their physical surroundings is aided by quantitative evaluation of focal adhesion size, number, orientation, and distribution in conjunction with the morphology of single cells and the corresponding nuclei. We developed a fast, user-friendly and automated image analysis algorithm capable of capturing and characterizing these individual components with a high level of accuracy. We demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the algorithm by quantifying morphological changes in response to a variety of environmental changes as well as manipulations of cellular components of mechanotransductions. Finally, as a proof-of-concept we use our algorithm to quantify the effect of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 on focal adhesion maturation. We show that a decrease in cell contractility leads to a decrease in focal adhesion size and aspect ratio.</content></content><author><name>Antonetta B. C.

We show that a decrease in cell contractility leads to a decrease in focal adhesion size and aspect ratio.</description></item><item><engagement>1</engagement><title>Looking for the best of both worlds</title><engagementRate>0.07</engagementRate><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16290894528:9ca4e57:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36366</canonicalUrl><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36366</originId><crawled>1522843338024</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36366</link><fingerprint>a3a04eb1</fingerprint><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Research institutions could do more to support scientists who are pregnant or have young children.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36366</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>bridgetmkuehn@gmail.com (Bridget M Kuehn)</name></author><published>1522800000000</published><description>Research institutions could do more to support scientists who are pregnant or have young children.</description></item><item><engagement>0</engagement><title>From rock-stable to reactive phosphorus</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1333?rss=1</link><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:415040d:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1333.full</canonicalUrl><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1333?rss=1</originId><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><fingerprint>3e153e6e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1333?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Protasiewicz, J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM).

The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma. Burden of these demands varied in difficulty among patient-participants due to capacity factors such as: positive attitudes, optimal health literacy, social support and availability of economic resources.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</content></content><author><name>Zhaoqing Du</name></author><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;
