UroSEEK incorporates massive parallel sequencing assays for mutations in 11 genes and copy number changes on 39 chromosome arms. In 570 patients at risk for bladder cancer (BC), UroSEEK was positive in 83% of those who developed BC. Combined with cytology, UroSEEK detected 95% of patients who developed BC. Of 56 patients with upper tract urothelial cancer, 75% tested positive by UroSEEK, including 79% of those with non-invasive tumors. UroSEEK detected genetic abnormalities in 68% of urines obtained from BC patients under surveillance who demonstrated clinical evidence of recurrence. The advantages of UroSEEK over cytology were evident in low-grade BCs; UroSEEK detected 67% of cases whereas cytology detected none.

Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes various diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are core transcription factors involved in TGF-β signaling, and they form heterotrimeric complexes with SMAD4 (SMAD2-SMAD2-SMAD4, SMAD3-SMAD3-SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4) in response to TGF-β signaling.

While previous approaches aim to capture all localization changes for a single screen as accurately as possible, our work aims to integrate large amounts of imaging data to find unexpected new cell biology.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31872</link><published>1522886400000</published><title>Integrating images from multiple microscopy screens reveals diverse patterns of protein subcellular localization change</title><fingerprint>a33bc888</fingerprint><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295b1cbfa:a2a3119:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522929880058</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31872</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03880-4</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Elizabeth Gibney</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The scant science behind Cambridge Analytica’s controversial marketing techniques&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scant science behind Cambridge Analytica’s controversial marketing techniques, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03880-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03880-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature peers into the evidence for ‘psychographic targeting’.</description><engagement>124</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03880-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03880-4</link><published>1522306800000</published><title>The scant science behind Cambridge Analytica’s controversial marketing techniques</title><fingerprint>72ab3cef</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The scant science behind Cambridge Analytica’s controversial marketing techniques&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scant science behind Cambridge Analytica’s controversial marketing techniques, Published online: 29 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03880-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03880-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature peers into the evidence for ‘psychographic targeting’.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16271872547:7263bd0:9f3b30f2</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522323105095</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00059</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Hao Wu, Chao Zeng, Yiwang Ye, Jixian Liu, Zhimin Mu, Yuancai Xie, Baokun Chen, Qiaohong Nong, Da Wu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00059/20180403/images/medium/mp-2018-000592_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00059&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits are common post-stroke and predict poor functional outcome. It is unknown if the presence of proprioception deficits is negatively associated with the motor and functional ability of the affected upper extremity and daily living at the chronic stage post-stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Aims &lt;p&gt;1) To describe proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke, 2) to correlate the severity of proprioception deficits with the motor and functional ability of the upper extremity, and 3) to compare independence in basic and instrumental activities in daily living (BADL, IADL), upper extremity motor and functional abilities between individuals with and without proprioception deficits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;102 adults aged 29–85 years with chronic stroke participated in this cross sectional study. The upper extremity was assessed for proprioception (Thumb localization Test), motor [Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMA)] and functional ability [Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT)], grip strength and daily use [Motor Activity Log (MAL)]. Independence in BADL and IADL was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;71 participants had intact proprioception, 31 participants had mild-moderate proprioception deficits. Negative significant (p&amp;lt;.001) correlations were found between the severity of proprioception deficits to the motor ability (FMA) (r = -.41), functional ability (ARAT) (r = -.48), dexterity (BBT) (r = -.43), grip strength (r = -.41) and daily-use (MAL amount and quality) (r = -.55 and r = -.54, respectively) of the affected upper extremity. Significant between-group differences were found for BADL, IADL and upper extremity measures.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Proprioception deficits of individuals with chronic stroke are negatively associated with upper extremity motor and functional abilities and independence in daily living.

To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Coupled ultradian growth and curvature oscillations during gravitropic movement in disturbed wheat coleoptiles</title><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

Transcription as the key step in gene expression is a highly regulated process. The speed of transcription elongation depends on the underlying gene sequence and varies on a gene by gene basis. The reason for this sequence dependence is not known in detail. Recently, our group studied the cross talk between the nascent RNA and the transcribing RNA polymerase by screening the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genome for RNA sequences with high affinity to RNA Pol by performing genomic SELEX. This approach led to the identification of RNA polymerase-binding APtamers termed “RAPs”. RAPs can have positive and negative effects on gene expression. A subgroup is able to downregulate transcription via the activity of the termination factor Rho. In this study, we used a similar SELEX setup using yeast genomic DNA as source of RNA sequences and highly purified yeast RNA Pol II as bait and obtained almost 1300 yeast-derived RAPs. Yeast RAPs are found throughout the genome within genes and antisense to genes, they are overrepresented in the non-transcribed strand of yeast telomeres and underrepresented in intergenic regions. Genes harbouring a RAP are more likely to show lower mRNA levels. By determining the endogenous expression levels as well as using a reporter system, we show that RAPs located within coding regions can reduce the transcript level downstream of the RAP. Here we demonstrate that RAPs represent a novel type of regulatory RNA signal in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; that act in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and interfere with the elongating transcription machinery to reduce the transcriptional output.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194438</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Nascent RNA signaling to yeast RNA Pol II during transcription elongation</title><fingerprint>a37b0dbb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Klopf, Murielle Moes, Fabian Amman, Bob Zimmermann, Frederike von Pelchrzim, Christina Wagner, Renée Schroeder&lt;/p&gt;

A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d8:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew P.

Background &lt;p&gt;The ageing population and the expected increase in the number of elderly patients make an evidence-based assessment of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy in old patients progressively more important. Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO results for patient aged &amp;lt;65 years is well known. However, the risk profile and in-hospital prognosis of advanced age patients with ECMO still need more investigation. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors that predicted the outcomes for elderly patients who received VA-ECMO.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this retrospective study, medical records for patients with ECMO aged 65 years and over were collected between 2009 and 2012 at a tertiary hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 99 patients (mean age: 76.4±6.4 years) were included. The most common condition requiring VA-ECMO support was cardiogenic shock. Among survivors on VA-ECMO, 28 (28.3%) patients were successfully weaned from support. Thirteen (13.1%) patients were successfully discharged. We found that cardiogenic shock (OR = 3.158, P = 0.013), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score (OR = 1.147, P&amp;lt;0.001), and simplified acute physiology score II (SAPS II) score (OR = 1.054, P = 0.001) were risk factors associated with survival on VA-ECMO. By using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve, the APACHE II score and SAPS II score displayed acceptable discriminative power (AUC 0.722; 0.715, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that the risk of mortality increases with cardiogenic shock, higher APACHE II score, and higher SAPS II score.

These risk factors can be utilized as potential predictors to identify the potential candidates for ECMO support.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195445</canonicalUrl><updated>1523048400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07a:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0126-0</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><author><name>William D.

The role of mental imagery has been puzzling researchers for more than two millennia. Both positive and negative effects of mental imagery on information processing have been discussed. The aim of this work was to examine how mental imagery affects object recognition and associative learning. Based on different perceptual and cognitive accounts we tested our &lt;i&gt;imagery-induced interaction hypothesis&lt;/i&gt; in a series of two experiments. According to that, mental imagery could lead to (1) a superior performance in object recognition and associative learning if these objects are imagery-congruent (semantically) and to (2) an inferior performance if these objects are imagery-incongruent. In the first experiment, we used a static environment and tested associative learning. In the second experiment, subjects encoded object information in a dynamic environment by means of a virtual sewer system. Our results demonstrate that subjects who received a role adoption task (by means of guided mental imagery) performed better when imagery-congruent objects were used and worse when imagery-incongruent objects were used. We finally discuss our findings also with respect to alternative accounts and plead for a multi-methodological approach for future research in order to solve this issue.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194227</link><published>1522270800000</published><title>A rat in the sewer: How mental imagery interacts with object recognition</title><fingerprint>7ab1db83</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Harun Karimpur, Kai Hamburger&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Carriers of mutations in hereditary cancer predisposition genes represent a small but clinically important subgroup of oncology patients. The identification of causal germline mutations determines follow-up management, treatment options and genetic counselling in patients’ families. Targeted next-generation sequencing-based analyses using cancer-specific panels in high-risk individuals have been rapidly adopted by diagnostic laboratories. While the use of diagnosis-specific panels is straightforward in typical cases, individuals with unusual phenotypes from families with overlapping criteria require multiple panel testing. Moreover, narrow gene panels are limited by our currently incomplete knowledge about possible genetic dispositions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We have designed a multi-gene panel called CZECANCA (CZEch CAncer paNel for Clinical Application) for a sequencing analysis of 219 cancer-susceptibility and candidate predisposition genes associated with frequent hereditary cancers.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The bioanalytical and bioinformatics pipeline was validated on a set of internal and commercially available DNA controls showing high coverage uniformity, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

This study investigated the role of individual differences (dark personality) and situational factors (perceived organisational support) in explaining intention to quit. Four hundred and fifty-one (50 of which females) ambulance personnel completed three questionnaires (Hogan Development Survey; Perceived Organisational Support Survey; and a single item Intention to Quit measure) as a part of a selection and development assessment. Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit. Additionally, employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, Reserved, and Leisurely, but low on Dutiful and Diligent had lower perceptions of organisational support. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that perceived organisational support plays both a mediating and moderating role on dark personality and intention to quit. Theoretical implications of personality’s role in perceived organisational support and intention to quit are discussed.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195155</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195155</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Intention to quit and the role of dark personality and perceived organizational support: A moderation and mediation model</title><fingerprint>9e3d181c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Luke Treglown, Katarina Zivkov, Anthony Zarola, Adrian Furnham&lt;/p&gt;

Employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, and Mischievous, but low on Colourful were found to have greater intentions to quit. Additionally, employees high on Excitable, Sceptical, Reserved, and Leisurely, but low on Dutiful and Diligent had lower perceptions of organisational support. Structural Equation Modelling revealed that perceived organisational support plays both a mediating and moderating role on dark personality and intention to quit. Theoretical implications of personality’s role in perceived organisational support and intention to quit are discussed.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195155</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde24:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23430-2</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Sabira Sultana</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23430-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23430-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kHYyCNs-Nww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23430-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/kHYyCNs-Nww/s41598-018-23430-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23430-2</link><published>1523516400000</published><title>Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly</title><fingerprint>2139b914</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23430-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23430-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Potential impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for the Queensland fruit fly&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/kHYyCNs-Nww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162b924a6a3:c62b95:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523524609699</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.44</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Laura J.

one-electron basis set to the limit of completeness does not improve results at
the DFT level, but just the opposite. The enthalpies of formation calculated at

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826e:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Dotu, Scott I.

Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1522355043476</recrawled></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009457?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Iurii Zhovtobriukh</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009457?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5009457?af=R</link><published>1523332676000</published><title>Relationship between x-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy and the local H-bond environment in water</title><fingerprint>8bc6388a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b852fc:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244913v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Lagarde, N.</name></author><description>Protein-protein interactions control a large range of biological processes and their identification is essential to understand the underlying biological mechanisms.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Maslinic acid (MA) is a component derived from a natural olive-based extract known to have pharmacological functions that include suppressing inflammation. This study examined how MA, in conjunction with whole-body vibration training (WBVT), can improve knee and muscle function in elderly women with knee osteoarthritis (OA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized intervention study that enrolled individuals with knee pain. Participants were 26 females aged 65–85 years with knee OA. They performed WBVT and ingested either 16.7 mg of MA or a placebo daily for 20 weeks. We compared the effect of WBVT with placebo (WBVT/P) and WBVT with MA (WBVT/MA) in participants with various degrees of knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) grade) using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score and isokinetic dynamometer measurements to evaluate knee and muscle function with two-way ANOVA.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Based on the results of two-way ANOVA analysis of muscle function measurements, there was significant interaction (time × group) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03) in the “isokinetic extension peak torque” domain for severe OA (K-L grade ≥ 3). The simple main effect of time in the WBVT/MA group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) contributed to this interaction. The JOA score for WBVT/MA supported the main effect of group as having a significant correlation in the “pain on walking” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and “range of motion” (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) domains. Participants with severe knee OA in the WBVT/MA group improved in these domains, whereas the WBVT/P group had few positive results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Participants with severe OA who ingested MA in conjunction with WBVT improved their knee and muscle function.

Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY peptide more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY peptide–induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 in macrophages.

Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated peptide targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY peptide specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY peptide reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY peptide substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer.

Control and synchronization of fractional-order chaotic systems have attracted wide attention due to their numerous potential applications. To get suitable control method and parameters for fractional-order chaotic systems, the stability analysis of time-varying fractional-order systems should be discussed in the first place. Therefore, this paper analyzes the stability of the time-varying fractional-order systems and presents a stability theorem for the system with the order 0&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;1. This theorem is a sufficient condition which can discriminate the stability of time-varying systems conveniently. Feedback controllers are designed for control and synchronization of the fractional-order Lü chaotic system. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theorem.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194112</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194112</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Controlling and synchronizing a fractional-order chaotic system using stability theory of a time-varying fractional-order system</title><fingerprint>69736440</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Huang, Dongfeng Wang, Jinying Zhang, Feng Guo&lt;/p&gt;

This work offers a new perspective on how to use dynamic metabolic modeling to investigate population dynamics, as the proposed approach can be easily transfered to studies on other multi-species communities as well as single cells.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/29/291492</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16274c35591:766c108:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522377381265</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4188.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Hector Sanchez–Iranzo, Maria Galardi–Castilla, Andres Sanz–Moreȷon, Juan Manuel Gonzalez–Rosa, Ricardo Costa, Alexander Ernst, Julio Sainz de Aȷa, Xavier Langa, Nadia Mercader</name></author><description>In the zebrafish (Danio rerio), regeneration and fibrosis after cardiac injury are not mutually exclusive responses.

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1626369d765:13d2b6:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mehdi Bouhaddou, Anne Marie Barrette, Alan D.

Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522086303589</crawled><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1522095842894</recrawled></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286641v2?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>DiMucci, D.</name></author><description>Microbes affect each other&apos;s growth in multiple, often elusive ways.

Repetitive DNA represents the major component of the genome in both plant and animal species. It includes transposable elements (TEs), which are dispersed throughout the genome, and satellite DNAs (satDNAs), which are tandemly organized in long arrays. The study of the structure and organization of repetitive DNA contributes to our understanding of genome architecture and the mechanisms leading to its evolution. Molluscs represent one of the largest groups of invertebrates and include organisms with a wide variety of morphologies and lifestyles. To increase our knowledge of bivalves at the genome level, we analysed the Antarctic scallop &lt;i&gt;Adamussium colbecki&lt;/i&gt;. The screening of the genomic library evidenced the presence of two novel satDNA elements and the CvA transposon. The interspecific investigation performed in this study demonstrated that one of the two satDNAs isolated in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;colbecki&lt;/i&gt; is widespread in polar molluscan species, indicating a possible link between repetitive DNA and abiotic factors.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the range, nature, and extent of current research activity exploring the influence of innovative health-related technologies on social inequalities in health, with specific focus on a deeper understanding of the variables used to measure this connection and the pathways leading to the (re)production of inequalities. A review process was conducted, based on scoping review techniques, searching literature published from January 1, 1996 to November 25, 2016 using MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI web of science. Search, sorting, and data extraction processes were conducted by a team of researchers and experts using a dynamic, reflexive examination process. Of 4139 studies collected from the search process, a total of 33 were included in the final analysis. Results of this study include the classification of technologies based on how these technologies are accessed and used by end users. In addition to the factors and mechanisms that influence unequal &lt;i&gt;access&lt;/i&gt; to technologies, the results of this study highlight the importance of variations in &lt;i&gt;use&lt;/i&gt; that importantly shape social inequalities in health. Additionally, focus on health care services technologies must be accompanied by investigating emerging technologies influencing healthy lifestyle, genomics, and personalized devices in health. Findings also suggest that choosing one measure of social position over another has important implications for the interpretation of research results. Furthermore, understanding the pathways through which various innovative health technologies reduce or (re)produce social inequalities in health is context dependent. In order to better understand social inequalities in health, these contextual variations draw attention to the need for critical distinctions between technologies based on how these various technologies are accessed and used. The results of this study provide a comprehensive starting point for future research to further investigate how innovative technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health as a human right.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195447</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195447</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Innovative technologies and social inequalities in health: A scoping review of the literature</title><fingerprint>a655d99</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Weiss, Håvard T.

&lt;p&gt;It now appears, though, that the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://beallslist.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;is back online&lt;/a&gt; in updated form, but is being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02921-2&quot;&gt;maintained anonymously&lt;/a&gt;. One of the people behind it told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; that they spend several hours a week dealing with inquiries and maintaining the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the journal titles aren’t already listed, the manager says they carry out an “in-depth analysis” of the publishers’ policies, checking them against a set of criteria originally laid out by Beall, and researching whether they are indexed on journal ‘whitelists’, such as the Directory of Open Access Journals or Journal Citation Reports. Journals or publishers deemed untrustworthy by the manager are included in an ‘update’ addendum on the blog. By March 2018, the new site had added 85 stand-alone journals and 27 publishers to Beall’s original lists of more than one thousand titles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for them. There are people who object to the idea that such journals are being called out anonymously, and there’s no doubt that the situation is open to potential abuse (although that doesn’t seem to be what’s happening so far). But what else to do when you’re barraged by threats if you do this work openly under your own name? Cabell’s is a company that has &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/07/25/cabells-new-predatory-journal-blacklist-review/&quot;&gt;taken on the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, with a subscription model blacklist (and whitelist), and it would be interesting to know what kind of flak they get from the hack publishers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As that last link says, though, there can be some confusion (and has been on Cabell’s list and others) between low-quality journals and predatory ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what are the problems? The most serious is that, as currently configured, Cabell’s Blacklist perpetuates the common problem of conflating low-quality journal publishing with deceptive or predatory publishing. In this case, the conflation happens because many of the blacklisting criteria Cabell’s applies are really quality criteria (“poor grammar and/or spelling,” “does not have a clearly stated peer review policy,” “no policy for digital preservation,” etc.) that can easily end up gathering fundamentally honest but less-competently-run journals into the same net as those journals that are actively trying to perpetrate a scam. Predatory and incompetent journals do often evince some of the same traits, but these traits don’t always indicate predatory intent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things overlap to a good degree, but not perfectly. Many of the predatory outfits, the we-have-three-hundred-journals-and-add-two-every-day folks, tend to be very sloppy and unprofessional quick-buck artists. But there are some rather slick ones, too, that at first glance don’t look that much different from actual journals. Meanwhile, there are actual journals, the smaller and/or newer ones, that can be rough around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by an “actual journal”, then? There are perfectly good open-access journals, so we can’t say that the distinction is whether someone has to pay to read it. I’d say that the big distinction is some level of editorial control – and by that, I don’t only mean “Just a proportion of the papers make it in”, although that’s often the case. Even in more wide-open journals such as &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, papers are reviewed to make sure that they appear to be technically sound (they just don’t make calls on a paper’s impact or importance), and the same goes for many of the other respectable open-access titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that brings up another criterion: a real journal has some care for what it publishes. A fake or predatory journal, though, does not give a damn. Their reason to exist is to publish as many manuscripts as they can get and collect the payments for them, and if those manuscripts are faked, incoherent, or plagiarized? &lt;em&gt;Oh well.&lt;/em&gt; Did the payment clear? All right, then. Plenty of other journals and their publishers are trying to make money – and how – but their method of doing so runs through some variation of “Attain and preserve some level of respect from the readers and authors”. That’s as opposed to “Shear those sheep and keep the line moving”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is impossible to publish everything that comes in the door and maintain that respect, because the stuff that comes in that door is seriously contaminated with garbage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html&quot;&gt;Here’s a famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the science-fiction publishing world, from editor Theresa Nielsen Hayden, called “Slushkiller”, about what comes in the transom where she works. About 70% of the submissions can be dismissed out of hand, usually within seconds, because the writing is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; disjointed or incoherent. Another 25% of the stuff is written reasonably competently, but has a totally overused or borrowed plotline or has some other such flaw that would make it unsaleable. Now you’re down to the last five per cent or so, which is where the real editorial decisions actually start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific publishing is not as different as one might hope. I don’t know how many green-ink religious revelation manuscripts &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; get, but I’ll bet its a nonzero number. There are surely a lot of papers that come in written in such a disorganized manner that they cannot even be reviewed. Beyond that, there are many, many manuscripts that are readable and apparently not wrong, but are still not right for the journal they’ve been submitted to (often because of those impact and importance factors, which is where &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, etc. come in). &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, for example, has said that it rejects about 60% of submitted manuscripts without review, so although the proportion is a bit better than it was at Tor Books, it still means that a solid majority of all submissions don’t even clear the first hurdle of editorial attention. &lt;em&gt;PLoS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, for its part, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://retractionwatch.com/2017/03/15/plos-one-faced-decline-submissions-new-editor-speaks/&quot;&gt;said recently&lt;/a&gt; that it ends up rejecting about 50% of its submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast with a predatory journal could not be greater. They can, and do, publish whatever gibberish comes in, as long as the money is good, while all the time pretending to be what they are not. Editorial attention of any type is incompatible with their business model. That, to me, is the difference, and that is why these journals must be shunned.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>The Scientific Literature</item><item>Uncategorized</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16286c49fac:8b62853:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522679455660</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/02/predation</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194621</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Rihab Ameri</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rihab Ameri, Elisabeth Laville, Gabrielle Potocki-Véronèse, Sahar Trabelsi, Monia Mezghani, Fatma Elgharbi, Samir Bejar&lt;/p&gt;
Dromedaries are capable of digesting plant cell wall with high content of lignocellulose of poor digestibility. Consequently, their intestinal microbiota can be a source of novel carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes). To the best of our knowledge, no data are available describing the biochemical analysis of enzymes in dromedary intestinal microbiota. To investigate new hydrolytic enzymes from the dromedary gut, a fosmid library was constructed using metagenomic DNA from feces of non-domestic adult dromedary camels living in the Tunisian desert. High-throughput functional screening of 13756 clones resulted in 47 hit clones active on a panel of various chromogenic and non-chromogenic glycan substrates. Two of them, harboring multiple activities, were retained for further analysis. Clone 26H3 displayed activity on AZO-CM-cellulose, AZCL Carob galactomannan and Tween 20, while clone 36A23 was active on AZCL carob galactomannan and AZCL barley β-glucan. The functional annotation of their sequences highlighted original metagenomic loci originating from bacteria of the Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi group, involved in the metabolization of mannosides and β-glucans thanks to a complete battery of endo- and exo-acting glycoside hydrolases, esterases, phosphorylases and transporters.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194621</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194621</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Two new gene clusters involved in the degradation of plant cell wall from the fecal microbiota of Tunisian dromedary</title><fingerprint>3ab574b9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rihab Ameri, Elisabeth Laville, Gabrielle Potocki-Véronèse, Sahar Trabelsi, Monia Mezghani, Fatma Elgharbi, Samir Bejar&lt;/p&gt;

A sensitive and innovative assay system based on a micro-MEMS-fluxgate sensor and immunomagnetic beads-labels was developed for the rapid analysis of C-reactive proteins (CRP). The fluxgate sensor presented in this study was fabricated through standard micro-electro-mechanical system technology. A multi-loop magnetic core made of Fe-based amorphous ribbon was employed as the sensing element, and 3-D solenoid copper coils were used to control the sensing core. Antibody-conjugated immunomagnetic microbeads were strategically utilized as signal tags to label the CRP via the specific conjugation of CRP to polyclonal CRP antibodies. Separate Au film substrates were applied as immunoplatforms to immobilize CRP-beads labels through classical sandwich assays. Detection and quantification of the CRP at different concentrations were implemented by detecting the stray field of CRP labeled magnetic beads using the newly-developed micro-fluxgate sensor. The resulting system exhibited the required sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and selectivity. A detection limit as low as 0.002 μg/mL CRP with a linearity range from 0.002 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL was achieved, and this suggested that the proposed biosystem possesses high sensitivity. In addition to the extremely low detection limit, the proposed method can be easily manipulated and possesses a quick response time. The response time of our sensor was less than 5 s, and the entire detection period for CRP analysis can be completed in less than 30 min using the current method. Given the detection performance and other advantages such as miniaturization, excellent stability and specificity, the proposed biosensor can be considered as a potential candidate for the rapid analysis of CRP, especially for point-of-care platforms.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194631</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>A sensitive and innovative detection method for rapid C-reactive proteins analysis based on a micro-fluxgate sensor system</title><fingerprint>f78ae144</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lei Guo, Zhen Yang, Shaotao Zhi, Zhu Feng, Chong Lei, Yong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).

Sustained virological response (SVR) rates have increased remarkably since the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C. Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine to lysophosphatidic acid and a newly established biomarker for liver fibrosis. Interferon-free DAA regimens for chronic hepatitis C could improve liver stiffness in SVR patients according to several non-invasive evaluation methods, but the clinical response and significance of ATX in this context have not yet been defined. We therefore investigated sequential serum ATX levels at baseline, 4 weeks after the start of treatment, and 24 weeks after treatment in 159 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who received DAA therapy. Other non-invasive fibrosis markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio and FIB-4 index) were examined as well. Baseline median ATX levels were comparable between the 144 patients who achieved a SVR and the 15 who did not (1.54 vs. 1.62 mg/L), but median ATX levels became significantly decreased during and after DAA therapy in the SVR group only (from 1.54 to 1.40 and 1.31 mg/L, respectively; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ATX was significantly decreased between baseline and 4 weeks of treatment in overall, male, and female SVR patients (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In subjects with low necroinflammatory activity in the liver (i.e., alanine aminotransferase &amp;lt; 30 U/L), ATX levels were significantly reduced from baseline to 4 weeks of treatment and remained low (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) in patients with a SVR. Thus, interferon-free DAA therapy was associated with a significant decrease in serum ATX levels in patients achieving a SVR, suggesting early regression of liver fibrosis in addition to inflammation treatment.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195632</canonicalUrl><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291d0cf6d:9ef1ecd:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864803693</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3126.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Ling Chen, Takeshi Azuma, Weiwei Yu, Xu Zheng, Liqun Luo, Lieping Chen</name></author><description>Induced B7-H1 expression in the tumor microenvironment initiates adaptive resistance, which impairs immune functions and leads to tumor escape from immune destruction.

Background &lt;p&gt;Healthcare students are future health care providers and serve as role models and coaches to enhance behaviors for healthy lifestyles. However healthcare students face multiple stressors that could lead to adopting risk behaviors.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the changes in health risk factors among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015, and to identify specific health behaviors based on the curriculum in a population of healthcare students:&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two cross sectionnal studies were conducted in 2007 and 2015 among nursing, medical, pharmacy, and physiotherapy students (Rouen, France). During compulsory courses and examination sessions students filled self-administered questionnaires on socio-demographic characteristics and behavior as: tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis consumption, eating disorders, regular practice of sport, perceived health, stress and use of psychotropic drugs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;2,605 healthcare students were included (1,326 in 2007 and 1,279 in 2015), comprising 1,225 medical students (47.0%), 738 nursing students (28.3%), 362 pharmacy students (13.9%), and 280 physiotherapy students (10.8%). Between 2007 and 2015, occasional binge drinking and regular practice of sport increased significantly among healthcare students, respectively AOR = 1.48 CI95% (1.20–1.83) and AOR = 1.33 CI95% (1.11–1.60), regular cannabis consumption decreased significantly, AOR = 0.32 CI95% (0.19–0.54). There was no change in smoking or overweight/obese. There was a higher risk of frequent binge drinking and a lower risk of tobacco smoking in all curricula than in nursing students. Medical students practiced sport on a more regular basis, were less overweight/obese, had fewer eating disorders than nursing students.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate a stable frequency of classic behaviors as smoking but a worsening of emerging behaviors as binge drinking among healthcare students between 2007 and 2015. Health behaviors differed according to healthcare curricula and nursing students demonstrated higher risks.

We identified 184 candidate compounds with in silico screening and tested 24 of them with enteroid-based forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) assay. The top hit compound was PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor that induced swelling in enteroid comparable to known CF corrector (lumacaftor). Further validation with Western blot and short circuit current analysis showed that PP-2 could correct mutant CFTR mis-folding and restore CFTR-mediated transmembrane current. We have identified PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor, as a novel corrector of {Delta}F508-CFTR.

We have identified PP2, a known src-kinase inhibitor, as a novel corrector of {Delta}F508-CFTR. Based on our studies and previous reports, src kinase inhibition may represent a novel paradigm of multi-action therapeutics - corrector, anti-inflammatory, and anti-infective - in CF.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/24/288324</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1625ad4c1ec:50d350e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521942315500</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/E3509.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Suresh Bugide, Michael R.

Cinacalcet hydrochloride (cinacalcet), an oral calcimimetic agent has been widely used for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). In sharp contrast to vitamin D receptor activators, cinacalcet suppresses SHPT without inducing hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. Nevertheless, some patients remain refractory to SHPT with this agent, as the dose cannot be sufficiently increased due to gastrointestinal symptoms. In order to resolve this issue, we have developed a newly synthesized calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580). In a rat model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy, oral administration of evocalcet efficiently suppressed the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). With regard to the gastro-intestinal effects, cinacalcet induced a significant delay in gastric emptying in rats, while evocalcet did no marked effects on it. Evocalcet also demonstrated the less induction of emesis compared to cinacalcet in common marmosets. The pharmacological effects of evocalcet were observed at lower doses because of its higher bioavailability than cinacalcet, which may have contributed to the reduced GI tract symptoms. In addition, evocalcet showed no substantial direct inhibition of any CYP isozymes in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; liver microsome assay, suggesting a better profile in drug interactions than cinacalcet that inhibits cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6. These findings suggest that evocalcet can be a better alternative to cinacalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, with a wider safety margin.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195316</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>A novel calcimimetic agent, evocalcet (MT-4580/KHK7580), suppresses the parathyroid cell function with little effect on the gastrointestinal tract or CYP isozymes &amp;lt;i&gt;in vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;in vitro&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>6e5b4f3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takehisa Kawata, Shin Tokunaga, Miki Murai, Nami Masuda, Waka Haruyama, Youji Shoukei, Yutaka Hisada, Tetsuya Yanagida, Hiroshi Miyazaki, Michihito Wada, Tadao Akizawa, Masafumi Fukagawa&lt;/p&gt;

This should surprise no one at all, but it’s good to have some quantitative data on the problem. There are limitations to the study – for one thing, it’s quite possible that (self-selected) respondents were among those more likely to have experienced these problems. The survey was done across 26 different countries (over 2200 respondents), 70% female/28% male/2% transgender, and the fields of study involved were 56% humanities and 38% physical sciences – no breakdown of the numbers by these categories is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with these reservations, I have no trouble believing the overall conclusions – based on my own experience and my observations since, I think that anxiety and depression are &lt;em&gt;very close to inevitable&lt;/em&gt; in graduate study, and that students should be aware of what they’re getting into. What’s happening, in any field, is the rubber finally meeting the road: you’re not just sitting in classrooms; you’re doing what practitioners of your chosen line of work actually do, and you’re finding out what that’s really like and whether or not you’re any good at it. If that doesn’t bring on the occasional bout of anxiety and self-doubt, then something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from that to depression is not such a huge jump, either. All of us who have been through grad school have seen people who sort of freeze up at some point in their progress. Sometimes it happens near the beginning, such as when chemistry graduate students move out of classes and into the labs – some of them just can’t seem to get anything going. I remember people who were always just about to start something, just about to figure out what went wrong with the last thing (which was spread out into a bunch of inconclusive samples around their hoods), just about to really start making some progress. But they never did. Later in the process, another familiar figure is the person who’s been hanging around for years in the lab, running ever more experiments to avoid writing up, as is their near-relative, the person who’s actually out of the lab, writing up that dissertation/thesis, expected to set a defense date pretty soon. . .and who in the end, is never heard from again after a while, finding themselves unable to get the thing done. After a while, the official notices from the department come back stamped “Addressee unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression might well be a good description of what’s going on in many of these situations. Someone finds themselves in an untenable situation and sinks into a state that makes it more untenable every day. David Foster Wallace defined a harmful addiction as something that offered itself as the remedy for the problems that it itself was causing (as with alcohol), and the downward-spiral mode of life has some similarities, as a big factor in what put you into this spot makes you ever less likely to do anything about it. The canonical view of major depression from the inside is William Styron’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2pFf7lZ&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Visible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but you don’t have to be as far along as Styron was to be in real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I got quite as far as depression myself, but there’s no doubt that I was under significant stress. Even the stock of stories that I have from grad school illustrates that. So many of them feature me losing my temper about something, and honestly, I rarely do that out here in the real world. I well recall unnerving bouts of fear and uncertainty, wondering if I was doing the right thing with my life, wondering if it was too late to do much about that even if I were, wondering if my research was any good or if I was any good at doing it, and what I was going to do about it if the answer to either or both of those were actually “No”. And so on. By the end of it, I was thoroughly sick of my project, wildly ready to get out the door and see what the post-doc life was going to be like (and very much wondering if it would turn out to be more of the same, in a different location).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some outright breakdowns while I was in grad school – there’s no other way to describe them. In some cases a person’s hours and behavior would become erratic, their actions hard to understand or predict. Sometimes in these the ship would apparently right itself and sometimes it wouldn’t. I saw examples of just those situations mentioned above, with people unable to make a real start in research or unable to write up at the end of it. And there was one flat-out suicide attempt, very nearly successful and permanently damaging to the person involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my own worst moments, I would be standing there in the lab feeling like a pitcher out on the mound who had just shaken off every pitch he knew how to throw. I was hauling material up the mountainside of a long linear synthesis, and I was frustrated to a degree beyond anything I’d ever experienced. I didn’t feel like working up the reactions in front of me, and I didn’t feel like setting up others. Waiting for me was my reward at the end of twenty-odd linear steps, the chance to risk all my hard work by trying (finally) some new chemistry that would probably not work and might well destroy my starting material in the process. Oh joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve told this next story before, but can’t track down the post where I did. At any rate, a pivotal moment was when I was bashing along with the largest load of starting material I’d ever made. Up at around step 9 (I was still in liter-sized flask territory) I was ready to work up the whole batch after a late-night reaction. I added some ammonium chloride and extracted the black mixture. That didn’t worry me; it was always black. I evaporated it down to a bunch of black oil and loaded it on a big gravity column of coarse silica gel – from prior runs, I knew that would hold the black crud at the top and allow a big yellow band of product to elute. Except this time the whole column turned black. Must have overloaded the column with this big pile of material, I thought. I collected a bunch of black fractions and rota-vapped them down, only to find what I sort of thought was a lot less oil than I’d been expecting. Reserving worry, I set up another column on that stuff, and this time the whole column turned black again, and nothing at all came out the other end but slightly discolored solvent. I had, in fact, destroyed my entire huge batch, because at 2 AM I was too groggy to remember that I was supposed to work it up with saturated bicarb, not ammonium chloride. All gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, alone, in the middle of the night, looking at all the mess I’d created. Ruined, all that batch of material that was going to finally get my synthesis finished and get me out of this place. I shook my head, cursed loudly, and went home, and to my surprise I fell asleep fairly quickly. What else was there to do? I woke up the next morning and went through that terrible disorienting feeling when after a few seconds you suddenly remember that something bad happened the night before. And then I got up and went to the lab, and set up an even larger batch back at the beginning of the synthesis, step one. Looking back, that night and that morning were a key episode in my graduate career and my life in general, because that batch I started that next day really did get me out in the end. I had bent and come very close to breaking at times, but it turned out that the worst had happened and I was still in one piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things definitely could have gone in other ways, though, and if they had there’s no telling where I would be now or what I would be doing. If that incident had happened to me a year before, I don’t know how I would have taken it. By the time I speak of, I had my eyes on the door and a PhD defense, having decided that the shortest way out of this awful situation was in that direction. I was devoting all my efforts to it, in an “OK, did today get me closer to defending, or not?” sort of way. Earlier, though, I was too far from the beginning and too far from the end to have that mindset, and a whopping failure would not have gone down well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s important for graduate students to realize that &lt;em&gt;everyone has these doubts and bad stretches&lt;/em&gt;. Everyone has these moments when they wonder what they’ve done to their lives, but having these thoughts is &lt;em&gt;not a sign&lt;/em&gt; that the exact failure you’re fearing has arrived. That doesn’t mean that thinking about your purpose in grad school is a bad thing, but it probably is a bad thing to try to do it at periods of peak emotional stress. If you feel that it really is getting too much, definitely talk to someone. Universities have people around for just that purpose – more so than in my day, fortunately – and if you find yourself wondering if you should reach out like that, then odds are that you should. Do it. I wish some of the people I worked with had, or had been able to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any meaningful graduate degree is going to be a test of your abilities and your resilience. Recognize this, and avoid the two extremes. On one end are the macho types whose response is “Eat stress for breakfast! That’s what I did in my day! If you don’t have the fire in your belly you don’t belong here!”. And on the other end are the voices, some perhaps external and some internal, telling you that you’re a failure already, an imposter, and that you’re never going to measure up anyway. These are two different sets of lies, and everyone has to steer their course between them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Graduate School</item></keywords><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_162629ce0bc:5b03560:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522072871100</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/26/depression-and-anxiety-in-graduate-school</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04598-z</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Aaron Schaal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science must rise up to support people like me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science must rise up to support people like me, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04598-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04598-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Institutions could do more to support researchers who have disabilities, says Aaron Schaal.</description><engagement>52</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04598-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04598-z</link><published>1524034800000</published><title>Science must rise up to support people like me</title><fingerprint>16027bdf</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science must rise up to support people like me&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science must rise up to support people like me, Published online: 18 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04598-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04598-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Institutions could do more to support researchers who have disabilities, says Aaron Schaal.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162d7cff073:37f456e:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04598-z/d41586-018-04598-z_15675370.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1524039151731</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>2.74</engagementRate></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00306</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Ralph P.

Notwithstanding newly discovered fold conservation between triplex proteins and bacteriophage protein gpD and the previously recognized bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like fold in VP5, HSV-1 capsid proteins exhibit extraordinary diversity in forms of domain insertion and conformational polymorphism, not only for interactions with tegument proteins but also for encapsulation of large genomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><keywords><item>Biochemistry, Microbiology, Online Only</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1629702fa06:a529823:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522951977478</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6384/eaao7298.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017906?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Syed Mohammad Fakruddin Shahed</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017906?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 11, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017906?af=R</link><published>1521083797000</published><title>Morphology of size-selected Ptn clusters on CeO2(111)</title><fingerprint>7c1edd89</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/11&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 11&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1625704c351:4c87b70:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521878352721</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03306-1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>Kendall Powell</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to sail smoothly from academia to industry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to sail smoothly from academia to industry, Published online: 21 March 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;This study was aimed to estimate life expectancy (LE), disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) and disabled life expectancy (DLE) among older adults from Santiago, Chile, and to determine the existence of differences by gender and by body mass index (BMI) categories in these indicators.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A sample of 1216 people aged 60 or more, from the Chilean cohort of the Study of Health, Ageing and Well-Being was recruited in 2000; two follow-up assessments were carried out in a 10-year period. Functional limitation was assessed through self-report of difficulties in activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living and mobility. BMI was determined with measured weight and height. Multistate life tables were employed to estimate LE and healthy life expectancy (HLE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At 60 years, women could expect to live on average an additional 20.4 years (95% CI 19.0–21.6), and men an additional 16.4 years (95% CI 14.9–17.7). Total LE was longer among women at all ages, but they had a higher proportion of disabled years to be lived compared to men, with a difference of 14% at 60 years, and 10% at 90 years. There were no significant differences in LE, DFLE and DLE between BMI categories.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Despite a longer LE, Chilean older women expect to live a higher proportion of years with disabilities, compared to men.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Influence of seating styles on head and pelvic vertical movement symmetry in horses ridden at trot</title><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

Unbound tetrapyrroles, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), chlorophyllide and chlorophylls, bring the risk of reactive oxygen species (ROS) being generated in the initial stages of angiosperm deetiolation due to inefficient usage of the excitation energy for photosynthetic photochemistry. We analyzed the activity of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in etiolated wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) leaves and at the beginning of their deetiolation. Mn-SOD and three isoforms of Cu/Zn-SODs were identified both in etiolated and greening leaves of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aestivum&lt;/i&gt;. Two Cu/Zn-SODs, denoted as II and III, were found in plastids. The activity of plastidic Cu/Zn-SOD isoforms as well as that of Mn-SOD correlated with cell aging along a monocot leaf, being the highest at leaf tips. Moreover, a high Pchlide content at leaf tips was observed. No correlation between SOD activity and the accumulation of photoactive Pchlide, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. Pchlide bound into ternary Pchlide:Pchlide oxidoreductase:NADPH complexes was found. Cu/Zn-SOD I showed the highest activity at the leaf base. A flash of light induced photoreduction of the photoactive Pchlide to chlorophyllide as well as an increase in all the SODs activity which occurred in a minute time-scale. In the case of seedlings that were deetiolated under continuous light of moderate intensity (100 μmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), only some fluctuations in plastidic Cu/Zn-SODs and Mn-SOD within the first four hours of greening were noticed. The activity of SODs is discussed with respect to the assembly of tetrapyrroles within pigment-protein complexes, monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy at 77 K.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194678</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194678</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>The activity of superoxide dismutases (SODs) at the early stages of wheat deetiolation</title><fingerprint>7b300dc7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gracjana Leonowicz, Kamil F.

It has been suggested that tactile signals are suppressed on a moving limb to free capacities for processing other relevant sensory signals. In line with this notion, we recently showed that tactile suppression is indeed stronger in the presence of reach-relevant somatosensory signals. Here we examined whether this effect also generalizes to the processing of additional visual signals during reaching. Brief vibrotactile stimuli were presented on the participants’ right index finger either during right-hand reaching to a previously illuminated target LED, or during rest. Participants had to indicate whether they detected the vibrotactile stimulus or not. The target LED remained off (&lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt;), or was briefly illuminated (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt;) during reaching, providing additional reach-relevant visual information about the target position. If tactile suppression frees capacities for &lt;i&gt;reach-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual information, suppression should be stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile&lt;/i&gt; condition. In an additional visual-discrimination condition (&lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt;), the target LED flashed once or twice during reaching and participants had to also report the number of flashes. If tactile suppression occurs to free additional capacities for &lt;i&gt;perception-relevant&lt;/i&gt; visual signals, tactile suppression should be even stronger in the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; visDis&lt;/i&gt; compared to the &lt;i&gt;tactile &amp;amp; vis&lt;/i&gt; condition. We found that additional visual signals improved reach endpoint accuracy and precision. In all conditions, reaching led to tactile suppression as indicated by higher detection thresholds compared to rest, confirming previous findings.

The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides.

The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides. Our results showed that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra were very close to the real-experimental spectra and had a relative-error distribution centered around 25%. In contrast the theoretical spectra for same peptides had relative-error distribution centered around 150%.

Recently, single-cell transcriptomic data have been massively used for gene regulatory network inference, with both successes and limitations. In the present work we propose an iterative algorithm called WASABI, dedicated to inferring a causal dynamical network from time-stamped single-cell data, which tackles some of the limitations associated with current approaches. We first introduce the concept of waves, which posits that the information provided by an external stimulus will affect genes one-by-one through a cascade, like waves spreading through a network. This concept allows us to infer the network one gene at a time, after genes have been ordered regarding their time of regulation. We then demonstrate the ability of WASABI to correctly infer small networks, which have been simulated in-silico using a mechanistic model consisting of coupled piecewise-deterministic Markov processes for the proper description of gene expression at the single-cell level. We finally apply WASABI on in-vitro generated data on an avian model of erythroid differentiation. The structure of the resulting gene regulatory network sheds a fascinating new light on the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. In particular, we find no evidence for hub genes and a much more distributed network structure than expected. Interestingly, we find that a majority of genes are under the direct control of the differentiation-inducing stimulus. In conclusion, WASABI is a versatile algorithm which should help biologists to fully exploit the power of time-stamped single-cell data.</description><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292128v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292128v1?rss=1</link><published>1522825200000</published><title>WASABI: a dynamic iterative framework for gene regulatory network inference [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>47878125</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Inference of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data has been a long-standing and notoriously difficult task in systems biology.

The goal of this study was to objectively assess the effect of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivate in English bulldogs with stifle degenerative joint disease secondary to cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). We used a force platform and affixed electrogoniometers to measure peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), stance time (ST), and angular range of motion (AROM), from 12 lame client-owned English bulldogs with post-CCLR stifle joint abnormalities. The 12 affected subjects were treated with 4 intra-articular injections of PRP, at 30-day intervals. Ten untreated, sound English bulldogs were used as a reference group. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model. Mean values of PVF, VI, ST, and AROM were improved within the first 3 months post-treatment in the CCLR group, with mean measured changes increasing to maximum 4.56% body weight gain, 1.5% body weight/second, 0.07 seconds, and 6.18 degrees, respectively. The effects declined progressively after the treatment interval, ending at nearly initial levels after 6 months. This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Effect of leukocyte-reduced platelet-rich plasma on osteoarthritis caused by cranial cruciate ligament rupture: A canine gait analysis model</title><fingerprint>8ba76de2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by José M.

This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194752</canonicalUrl><updated>1521493200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f8908:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Sangwan Sim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03558-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/MyBJiMhSYAE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/MyBJiMhSYAE/s41467-018-03558-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5</link><published>1521702000000</published><title>Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS2</title><fingerprint>8676fee2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03558-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03558-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Ultrafast quantum beats of anisotropic excitons in atomically thin ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/MyBJiMhSYAE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1624d3d0584:3d95f31:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521714267524</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3018.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Sandra Blanchet, David Cornu, Isabelle Hatin, Henri Grosjean, Pierre Bertin, Olivier Namy</name></author><description>Some codons of the genetic code can be read not only by cognate, but also by near-cognate tRNAs.

Phyllotaxis, the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem, is well known because of its beautiful geometric configuration, which is derived from the constant spacing between leaf primordia. This phyllotaxis is established by mutual interaction between a diffusible plant hormone auxin and its efflux carrier PIN1, which cooperatively generate a regular pattern of auxin maxima, small regions with high auxin concentrations, leading to leaf primordia. However, the molecular mechanism of the regular pattern of auxin maxima is still largely unknown. To better understand how the phyllotaxis pattern is controlled, we investigated mathematical models based on the auxin–PIN1 interaction through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, focusing on the spatial regularity control of auxin maxima. As in previous reports, we first confirmed that this spatial regularity can be reproduced by a highly simplified and abstract model. However, this model lacks the extracellular region and is not appropriate for considering the molecular mechanism. Thus, we investigated how auxin maxima patterns are affected under more realistic conditions. We found that the spatial regularity is eliminated by introducing the extracellular region, even in the presence of direct diffusion between cells or between extracellular spaces, and this strongly suggests the existence of an unknown molecular mechanism. To unravel this mechanism, we assumed a diffusible molecule to verify various feedback interactions with auxin–PIN1 dynamics. We revealed that regular patterns can be restored by a diffusible molecule that mediates the signaling from auxin to PIN1 polarization. Furthermore, as in the one-dimensional case, similar results are observed in the two-dimensional space. These results provide a great insight into the theoretical and molecular basis for understanding the phyllotaxis pattern. Our theoretical analysis strongly predicts a diffusible molecule that is pivotal for the phyllotaxis pattern but is yet to be determined experimentally.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1PcJThDi81k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903f:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hironori Fujita, Masayoshi Kawaguchi&lt;/p&gt;

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16253fa0281:3c81d7:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Solernou, Benjamin S.

Macrophages are immune cells that compose the first line of an organism&apos;s defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the causative agent of TB. Interactions between macrophages and M.tb define the infection outcome. Enhancers are cis-regulatory DNA elements that activate transcription of target genes and mediate various responses in macrophages. To what extent the host&apos;s genetic response to infection is controlled by enhancers remains unexplored. We analysed the regulation by transcribed enhancers in M.tb-infected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that transcribed enhancers have a strong influence in the M.tb infection response and mediate up-regulation of many important immune genes. We characterise highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and show that many genes acquire de novo transcribed enhancers upon M.tb infection. We report enhancers targeting known immune genes crucial for the host&apos;s genetic response to M.tb, such as Tnf, Tnfrsf1b, Irg1, Hilpda, Ccl3, and Ccl4, and highlight transcription factors that are likely regulating these enhancers including AP-1, NF-kB, Irf1, and Rbpj. Finally, we highlight particular chromosomal domains carrying groups of highly transcriptionally induced enhancers and genes with previously unappreciated roles in M.tb infection, such as Fbxl3, Tapt1, Edn1, and Hivep1. Our study links M.tb-responsive transcription factors to activation of transcribed enhancers, which, in turn, target protein-coding immune genes upon infection. We find that many genes who respond with increased expression to M.tb are under the control of transcribed enhancers. Our findings extend current knowledge of M.tb-response regulation in macrophages and provide a basis for future functional studies on enhancer-gene interactions in this process.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303552v1?rss=1</link><published>1524034800000</published><title>Transcribed enhancers in the macrophage immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>b31184a2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health threat and cause of death worldwide.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, and survival signatures are urgently needed to better monitor treatment. MiRNAs displayed vital regulatory roles on target genes, which was necessary involved in the complex disease. We therefore examined the expression levels of miRNAs and genes to identify robust signatures for survival benefit analyses. First, we reconstructed subpathway graphs by embedding miRNA components that were derived from low-throughput miRNA-gene interactions. Then, we randomly divided the data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into training and testing sets, and further formed 100 subsets based on the training set. Using each subset, we identified survival-related miRNAs and genes, and identified survival subpathways based on the reconstructed subpathway graphs. After statistical analyses of these survival subpathways, the most robust subpathways with the top three ranks were identified, and risk scores were calculated based on these robust subpathways for AML patient prognoses. Among these robust subpathways, three representative subpathways, path: 05200_10 from Pathways in cancer, path: 04110_20 from Cell cycle, and path: 04510_8 from Focal adhesion, were significantly associated with patient survival in the TCGA training and testing sets based on subpathway risk scores. In conclusion, we performed integrated analyses of miRNAs and genes to identify robust prognostic subpathways, and calculated subpathway risk scores to characterize AML patient survival.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194245</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194245</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Identification of a robust subpathway-based signature for acute myeloid leukemia prognosis using an miRNA integrated strategy</title><fingerprint>68f593b2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huijuan Chang, Qiuying Gao, Wei Ding, Xueqin Qing&lt;/p&gt;

The increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus is becoming a serious threat to human health in various parts of the world. Studies with dairy products have shown a potential beneficial effect against diabetes. This experiment evaluated the supplementation of milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and polyphenols in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Forty male 28-day-old &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats were distributed in four experimental treatments of diabetic animals (streptozotocin induction) and a normal group (non-induced). Experimental treatments were: control (water), whole common milk (COM-M), milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M), milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M) through a special diet offered to dairy cows. Milk supplementation at a dose 5 mL/kg body weight was performed for 77 days, 42 days before and 35 days after diabetes induction. The COM-M supplementation increased brown fat deposits, reduced post-induction glucose levels, reduced blood fructosamine levels, and improved glucose tolerance. Milk enriched with PUFA reduced final fasting glucose, LDL levels, and improved blood antioxidant capacity. Milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols promoted an increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass, and a reduction in mesenteric fat and LDL levels. Milk intake, with an emphasis on milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols, attenuated the metabolic disorders of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195839</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Functionality of cow milk naturally enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols in diets for diabetic rats</title><fingerprint>9dcd7556</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emerson H.

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states).

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</canonicalUrl><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde36:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01831</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Tomislav Roncevic, Damir Vukicevic, Nada Ilic, Lucija Krce, Goran Gajski, Marija Tonkic, Ivana Goic-Barišic, Larisa Zoranic, Yogesh Sonavane, Monica Benincasa, Davor Juretic, Ana Maravic, Alessandro Tossi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01831/20180329/images/medium/jm-2017-01831q_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01831&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability. Despite the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the discovery of its genetic aberrations, the exact pathogenesis of the DS phenotype has remained largely unexplained. It was recently hypothesized that the DS pathogenesis involves complex (epi)genetic, molecular and cellular determinants. To date, many reports have addressed epigenetic aberrations associated with DS at different developmental stages/ages and tissue types, but to our best knowledge not in DS newborns. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide methylation patterns in DS newborns compared to non-trisomic newborns.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;We analyzed blood samples obtained from ten newborns with DS and five age-matched non-trisomic newborns. Epigenetic profiles were obtained from extracted DNA using the Illumina Infinium 450K array. Since aberrant blood cell distribution is known to be present in DS, we applied two distinct models: with and without correction for estimated blood cell distribution.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Differentially methylated position (DMP) analysis of the uncorrected model detected 19525 significant hits (51,2% hypomethylated). In the corrected model, we found 121953 significant DMPs (49,8% hypomethylated). Independent of the used model we observed a chromosome 21 dosage effect. Moreover, we detected 46 and 145 differentially methylated regions in the uncorrected and corrected model respectively, both showing hypomethylation overrepresentation. Replication analyses of DMPs and DMRs found by Bacalini &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. (2015) showed a large overlap.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this study, we found methylation profile differences between DS newborns and controls reflecting a systematically affected epigenetic profile. The observed chromosome 21 dosage effect suggests the involvement of affected essential regulatory factors/regions or altered expression of chromatin modeling enzymes located on chromosome 21. Additional research is necessary to substantiate these hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194938</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194938</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>Widespread domain-like perturbations of DNA methylation in whole blood of Down syndrome neonates</title><fingerprint>8d6b0412</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Henneman, Arjan Bouman, Adri Mul, Lia Knegt, Anne-Marie van der Kevie-Kersemaekers, Nitash Zwaveling-Soonawala, Hanne E.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI.

Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization. Initial SWAN- and follow-up DWI-based mASPECTSs were significantly higher for atherothrombotic stroke than for cardioembolic stroke. Of 12 patients without recanalization, DWI-SWAN mismatch was significantly correlated with infarct growth. Patients with recanalization showed no such correlation. In the assessment of clinical outcome, follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and patient&apos;s age were significantly correlated with mRS at 90 days after stroke. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS was independently associated with a favorable outcome 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;For patients with AIS, DWI-SWAN mismatch might show penumbra-like lesions that would predict infarct growth without acute recanalization.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;T2*-weighted magnetic resonance angiography (SWAN) detects hemodynamic insufficiency as hypointense areas in medullary or cortical veins. We therefore investigated whether SWAN can help predict ischemic penumbra-like lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) records—including SWAN, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)—of consecutive patients with major vessel occlusion within 6 h from AIS onset were analyzed. Acute recanalization was defined as an arterial occlusive lesion score of 2–3. A modified Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (mASPECTS) was used to evaluate ischemic areas revealed by SWAN and DWI. SWAN- and DWI-based mASPECTSs were calculated, and correlations between DWI-SWAN mismatches with final infarct lesions or clinical outcomes were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among the 35 patients included in this study, we confirmed cardioembolic stroke in 26, atherothrombotic stroke in 4, and unknown stroke etiology in 5. Overall, recanalization was achieved in 23 patients, who showed a higher follow-up DWI-based mASPECTS and lower modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days than patients without recanalization.

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d20:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papaïx, Jean-François Rey, Luke G.

This construct, composed of only naturally occurring immunoglobulin sequences without artificial linkers, expressed at a high level in mammalian cells, however exhibited low solubility. Rational mutagenesis aimed at the amino acid residues located at the interface of the variable domains and the exchanged C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;3 domains was applied to improve the biophysical properties of the molecule. The domain-exchanged construct, including variable domains of the HER2/neu specific antibody trastuzumab, was able to bind to the surface of the strongly HER2/neu positive cell line SK-BR3 4-fold weaker than trastuzumab, but could nevertheless incite a more potent response in an antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) reporter assay with FcγRIIIa-overexpressing T-cells. This could be explained with a stronger binding to the FcγRIIIa. Importantly, the novel construct could mediate a specific ADCC effect with natural killer cells similar to the parental antibody.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195442</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195442</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>An antibody with Fab-constant domains exchanged for a pair of C&amp;lt;sub&gt;H&amp;lt;/sub&gt;3 domains</title><fingerprint>d89e2e47</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gordana Wozniak-Knopp, Gerhard Stadlmayr, Jan Walther Perthold, Katharina Stadlbauer, Mathias Gotsmy, Stefan Becker, Florian Rüker&lt;/p&gt;

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/286260v2?rss=1</link><published>1522825200000</published><title>Evidence for a potential role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmune disease risk using genome-wide analyses [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>2089d19e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases.

Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/04/286260</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16291cb2608:9ee96b1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864432648</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195064</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Christian Patry</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Patry, Christoph Remmé, Christian Betzen, Burkhard Tönshoff, Benito A.

In this study, we investigated whether the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), VCAM-1 (vascular adhesion molecule-1), E-selectin und L-selectin, which are involved in homing of vascular stem cells, are upregulated by CD34&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD133&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-stem cells from septic patients and would be associated with improved clinical outcome. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from intensive care unit (ICU) patients with (n = 30) and without sepsis (n = 10), and healthy volunteers (n = 15) were isolated using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation.

The severity of disease was assessed by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II.

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Interaction of microtubule depolymerizing agent indanocine with different human αβ tubulin isotypes</title><fingerprint>6be3d66c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;With the greatest burden of infant undernutrition and morbidity in low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a need for suitable approaches to monitor infants in a simple, low-cost and effective manner. Anthropometry continues to play a major role in characterising growth and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a range of models to aid in identifying neonates at risk of malnutrition. We first adopted a logistic regression approach to screen for a composite neonatal morbidity, low and high body fat (BF%) infants. We then developed linear regression models for the estimation of neonatal fat mass as an assessment of body composition and nutritional status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We fitted logistic regression models combining up to four anthropometric variables to predict composite morbidity and low and high BF% neonates. The greatest area under receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) for identifying composite morbidity was 0.740 (0.63, 0.85), resulting from the combination of birthweight, length, chest and mid-thigh circumferences. The AUCs (95% CI) for identifying low and high BF% were 0.827 (0.78, 0.88) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88), respectively.For identifying composite morbidity, BF% as measured via air displacement plethysmography showed strong predictive ability (AUC 0.786 (0.70, 0.88)), while birthweight percentiles had a lower AUC (0.695 (0.57, 0.82)). Birthweight percentiles could also identify low and high BF% neonates with AUCs of 0.792 (0.74, 0.85) and 0.834 (0.79, 0.88). We applied a sex-specific approach to anthropometric estimation of neonatal fat mass, demonstrating the influence of the testing sample size on the final model performance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These models display potential for further development and evaluation in LMICs to detect infants in need of further nutritional management, especially where traditional methods of risk management such as birthweight for gestational age percentiles may be variable or non-existent, or unable to detect appropriately grown, low fat newborns.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195193</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>An anthropometric approach to characterising neonatal morbidity and body composition, using air displacement plethysmography as a criterion method</title><fingerprint>a54b841f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jacqueline Huvanandana, Angela E.

Mitochondrial function affects many aspects of cellular physiology, and, most recently, its role in epigenetics has been reported. Mechanistically, how mitochondrial function alters DNA methylation patterns in the nucleus remains ill defined. Using a cell culture model of induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, in this study we show that progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an early transcriptional and metabolic program centered on the metabolism of various amino acids, including those involved in the methionine cycle. We find that this program also increases DNA methylation, which occurs primarily in the genes that are differentially expressed. Maintenance of mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) oxidation in the context of mtDNA loss rescues methionine salvage and polyamine synthesis and prevents changes in DNA methylation and gene expression but does not affect serine/folate metabolism or transsulfuration. This work provides a novel mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and epigenetic regulation of gene expression that involves polyamine and methionine metabolism responding to changes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Given the implications of these findings, future studies across different physiological contexts and in vivo are warranted.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wIS7B5HAgw8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb3170:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Azathioprine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug. Genetic polymorphisms and activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) have been associated with azathioprine efficacy and toxicity in several populations. We investigated whether these associations also exist for ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) patients, who receive azathioprine maintenance therapy after remission induction with cyclophosphamide.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;207 AAV patients treated with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance therapy were included and followed for 60 months. &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype and tertiles of TPMT activity were compared to relapse free survival and occurrence of adverse events, particularly leukopenia. Multivariable regression was performed to account for confounders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In univariable analysis, relapse free survival was not significantly associated with &lt;i&gt;TPMT&lt;/i&gt; genotype (P = 0.41) or TPMT activity (P = 0.07), although it tended to be longer in lower tertiles of TPMT activity. There was no significant association of TPMT genotype and activity with occurrence of any adverse event. In multiple regression, leukocyte counts at the end of cyclophosphamide induction were related to risk of leukopenia during azathioprine therapy [P&amp;lt;0.001; OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.43–0.68)] and risk of relapse during follow-up [P = 0.001; HR 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.29)] irrespective of TMPT genotype or activity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;TPMT genotype and activity were not independent predictors of relapse, and could not predict leukopenia or other adverse effects from azathioprine. Leukocyte counts after cyclophosphamide induction were related to both outcomes, implying a greater influence of cyclophosphamide response compared to azathioprine and TPMT in AAV patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195524</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195524</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Thiopurine methyltransferase genotype and activity cannot predict outcomes of azathioprine maintenance therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis: A retrospective cohort study</title><fingerprint>d5573a20</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arno C.

TB infection in patients after kidney transplantation remains a concern in a successful long-term outcome. This retrospective, descriptive study was performed on tuberculosis infection after kidney transplantation in the Department of Infectious Disease of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, a tertiary care hospital in China, from January 2011 to April 2017, with the aim to explain the clinical features of active tuberculosis after kidney transplantation and explore the correlated factors for diagnostic delay and mortality. It included 48 cases. All these cases were followed up for at least 12 months after anti-tuberculosis therapy, except the ones who died during this period. The median time of transplantation to active tuberculosis of these 48 patients was about 5.4 years. The time from a first hospital visit to the diagnosis (diagnostic delay) of 12 (25%) cases was more than 30 days. The correlated factors for the diagnostic delay more than 30 days were a fever for more than 2 weeks and antibiotic use for more than 2 weeks. Nine (18.8%) cases died during the anti-tuberculosis therapy or following-up period due to TB relapse. The risk factors for mortality were severe complications, such as encephaledema, severe pneumonia, intestinal perforation, liver function failure, and the following multiple-organ failure. In conclusion, the possibility of tuberculosis infection should be carefully assessed and sometimes diagnostic anti-tuberculosis therapy may be required for patients who had a fever for more than 2 weeks or used antibiotics for more than 2 weeks after kidney transplantation. Severe complications and the following multiple-organ failure might increase the mortality among these patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195695</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195695</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Diagnostic delay and mortality of active tuberculosis in patients after kidney transplantation in a tertiary care hospital in China</title><fingerprint>ea1aa012</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wu, Meifang Yang, Min Xu, Cheng Ding, Yongtao Li, Kaijin Xu, Jifang Shen, Lanjuan Li&lt;/p&gt;

We achieved recording of multiple stimuli in bacteria or mammalian cells, including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, light, and changes in Wnt signaling. When recording to multicopy plasmids, reliable readout requires as few as 10 to 100 cells.

The devices record signal amplitude or duration as changes in the ratio of mutually exclusive DNA sequences (CAMERA 1) or as single-base modifications (CAMERA 2). We achieved recording of multiple stimuli in bacteria or mammalian cells, including exposure to antibiotics, nutrients, viruses, light, and changes in Wnt signaling. When recording to multicopy plasmids, reliable readout requires as few as 10 to 100 cells.

It’s from the IBM Zürich group that has pioneered so much work in this area. Over just the time I’ve been writing this blog, that idea has gone from “Maybe someday” to “In some well-defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/09/03/real_molecules&quot;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;” to “A few real-world examples known”, and now perhaps to “Hey, this might actually start working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not just AFM. There’s also scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), among other even more exotic ideas, and together you can get information that simply cannot be obtained by any other methods. Here they are in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFM is done typically by picking up a single CO molecule (from the carbon end) with the tip of the metal probe and scanning with the oxygen end across an adsorbed molecule (at liquid helium temperatures) at a constant height, about 4 Angstroms over the molecule itself. Often you go back and scan at several different tip heights. There are many other possible tips – xenon atoms, other diatomic molecules, halogen atoms, and so on. The cantilever holding the tip is oscillating (over about half an Angstrom) at a high frequency, and changes in this, induced by interactions with the molecule under study, are what get measured out (along with deflections in the angle that the CO molecule makes with the surface).  The mechanism for these changes is just flat-out Pauli repulsion for the most part – electrons not wanting to occupy the same volume of space and getting out of each other’s way – although van der Waals and electrostatic forces can show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPFM is pretty similar, except the readout is the voltage dependence of the position of the tip relative to the molecule, rather than changes in frequency of oscillation. You pick a voltage that gives you good signal/noise and scan around as with AFM. In practice, that gives you more of a pure electrostatic read on the surface, and it’s very useful for determining charge states and electron density in the sample. For example, fluorine is very close to the size of hydrogen, but they look dramatically different in KPFM because of the mass of electrons around the F atoms. Interpretation of the data, though, is not very straightforward, and often seems to involve matching up the experimental results to various calculations to try to see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in STM you apply a voltage to the tip and measure the changes in electric current between the tip and the sample as you scan, often by having the tip height change to keep a constant current level. At these distances, electrons are tunneling right across the gap, so this is sheer quantum mechanics all the way. If you pick the appropriate voltage, electrons can be temporarily attached to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the test molecule (or detached from the highest-occupied, the HOMO, if you flip the voltage around), and the resulting images are absolutely &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; for someone like me who came up thinking of these as mathematical abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of these, with a CO tip used to show the bonds in the graphene-like molecule and then (in STM mode), its LUMO. As you can see, the resolution on these experiments is getting pretty good, and allows for an unequivocal assignment of the structure. Of course, an X-ray structure determination would almost certainly nail that down, too, but for that you have to have a purified sample and a good crystal. One interesting thing about AFM-type techniques is that you can scatter a mixed sample across the surface and take a look at the various things that might be in it, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an illustration of something else that can really only be done under AFM conditions: actual atomic-level manipulation of the sample. Individual atoms can be pushed, twanged, or (as in this case) removed entirely. The result can be highly reactive intermediates (radicals, arynes, etc.) that can be studied directly at the liquid-helium temperatures involved. There are also opportunities to do on-surface reaction by heating followed by cooling down to AFM conditions, through photochemistry, etc. You can also study the interaction of individual molecules with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has to be said that there are not very many labs that are capable of these things at the moment, but that’s changing with the advent of more commercial apparatus and the spread of experienced workers in the field. What’s lacking? As the authors note, there’s a real need for techniques that might be able to read out functional groups and elements more directly. An even bigger challenge is that all the most spectacular results to date have been on planar or near-planar molecules, since these yield the most (and the most interpretable) data. You’re running your quantum fingers over the surface of things here, so the inside of a folded-up conformation is just not going to be available. And finally, there need to be improvements in the time it takes to get a measurement. It’s been stuck at roughly ten-minutes-per-molecule for a long time, but better time resolution would allow for a lot of new things to be picked up (and for better characterization of mixtures, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

However, the magnitude of the mutation-driven effects on the macromolecular network is yet to be fully explored. In this work, we present an systematic multi-level characterization of human mutations associated with genetic disorders by determining their individual and combined interaction-rewiring, edgetic, effects on the human interactome. Our in-silico analysis highlights the intrinsic differences and important similarities between the pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and frameshift mutations. We show that pathogenic SNVs are more likely to cause gene pleiotropy than pathogenic frameshift mutations and are enriched on the protein interaction interfaces. Functional profiling of SNVs indicates widespread disruption of the protein-protein interactions and synergistic effects of SNVs. The coverage of our approach is several times greater than the recently published experimental study and has the minimal overlap with it, while the distributions of determined edgotypes between the two sets of profiled mutations are remarkably similar. Case studies reveal the central role of interaction-disrupting mutations in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and suggest the importance of studying mutations that abnormally strengthen the protein interactions in cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology that drives precision medicine, there is an increasing demand in understanding the changes in molecular mechanisms caused by the patient-specific genetic variation.

Along with the rapid development of Intelligent Transportation Systems, traffic data collection technologies have progressed fast. The emergence of innovative data collection technologies such as remote traffic microwave sensor, Bluetooth sensor, GPS-based floating car method, and automated license plate recognition, has significantly increased the variety and volume of traffic data. Despite the development of these technologies, the missing data issue is still a problem that poses great challenge for data based applications such as traffic forecasting, real-time incident detection, dynamic route guidance, and massive evacuation optimization. A thorough literature review suggests most current imputation models either focus on the temporal nature of the traffic data and fail to consider the spatial information of neighboring locations or assume the data follow a certain distribution. These two issues reduce the imputation accuracy and limit the use of the corresponding imputation methods respectively. As a result, this paper presents a Kriging based data imputation approach that is able to fully utilize the spatiotemporal correlation in the traffic data and that does not assume the data follow any distribution. A set of scenarios with different missing rates are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two other widely used methods, historical average and K-nearest neighborhood. Comparison results indicate that the proposed method has the highest imputation accuracy and is more flexible compared to other methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195957</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195957</link><published>1523998800000</published><title>A Kriging based spatiotemporal approach for traffic volume data imputation</title><fingerprint>1f5c87d9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hongtai Yang, Jianjiang Yang, Lee D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy is increasingly used to treat oligometastatic patients. We sought to identify prognostic criteria in oligometastatic patients undergoing definitive hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (HIGRT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exclusively extracranial&lt;/i&gt; oligometastatic patients treated with HIGRT were pooled. Characteristics including age, sex, primary tumor type, interval to metastatic diagnosis, number of treated metastases and organs, metastatic site, prior systemic therapy for primary tumor treatment, prior definitive metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy for metastasis associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and treated metastasis control (TMC) were assessed by the Cox proportional hazards method. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) identified prognostic risk strata for OS and PFS based on pretreatment factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;361 patients were included. Primary tumors included non-small cell lung (17%), colorectal (19%), and breast cancer (16%). Three-year OS was 56%, PFS was 24%, and TMC was 72%. On multivariate analysis, primary tumor, interval to metastases, treated metastases number, and mediastinal/hilar lymph node, liver, or adrenal metastases were associated with OS. Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p &amp;lt; 0.01) was associated with OS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195149</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195149</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Classification for long-term survival in oligometastatic patients treated with ablative radiotherapy: A multi-institutional pooled analysis</title><fingerprint>489912ba</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Julian C.

Primary tumor site, involved organ number, liver metastasis, and prior primary disease chemotherapy were associated with PFS.OS RPA identified five classes: class 1: all breast, kidney, or prostate cancer patients (BKP) (3-year OS 75%, 95% CI 66–85%); class 2: patients without BKP with disease-free interval of 75+ months (3-year OS 85%, 95% CI 67–100%); class 3: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≤ two metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 55%, 95% CI 48–64%); class 4: patients without BKP, shorter disease-free interval, ≥ three metastases, and age &amp;lt; 62 (3-year OS 38%, 95% CI 24–60%); class 5: all others (3-year OS 13%, 95% CI 5–35%). Higher biologically effective dose (BED) (p &amp;lt; 0.01) was associated with OS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We identified clinical factors defining oligometastatic patients with favorable outcomes, who we hypothesize are most likely to benefit from metastasis-directed therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195149</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc713a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4176.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Silvia Vega–Rubin–de–Celis, Zhongȷu Zou, Alvaro F.

The 5&apos; RNA cap structure (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA) is a key feature of eukaryotic mRNAs with important roles in stability, splicing, polyadenylation, mRNA export, and translation. Higher eukaryotes can further modify this minimal cap structure with the addition of a methyl group on the ribose 2&apos;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt; position of the first transcribed nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA) and sometimes on the adjoining nucleotide (&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pN&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;pRNA). In higher eukaryotes, the DXO protein was previously shown to be responsible for both decapping and degradation of RNA transcripts harboring aberrant 5’ ends such as pRNA, pppRNA, GpppRNA, and surprisingly, &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNA. It was proposed that the interaction of the cap binding complex with the methylated cap would prevent degradation of &lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;GpppRNAs by DXO. However, the critical role of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation found in higher eukaryotic cap structures was not previously addressed. In the present study, we demonstrate that DXO possesses both decapping and exoribonuclease activities toward incompletely capped RNAs, only sparing RNAs with a 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylated cap structure. Fluorescence spectroscopy assays also revealed that the presence of the 2’-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methylation on the cap structure drastically reduces the affinity of DXO for RNA. Moreover, immunofluorescence and structure-function assays also revealed that a nuclear localisation signal is located in the amino-terminus region of DXO. Overall, these results are consistent with a quality control mechanism in which DXO degrades incompletely capped RNAs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193804</link><published>1522443600000</published><title>2&apos;-&amp;lt;i&gt;O&amp;lt;/i&gt;-methylation of the mRNA cap protects RNAs from decapping and degradation by DXO</title><fingerprint>190975c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Frédéric Picard-Jean, Carolin Brand, Maude Tremblay-Létourneau, Andréa Allaire, Maxime C.

Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused great public concerns due to its recent large outbreaks and a close association with microcephaly in fetus and Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Rapid development of vaccines against ZIKV is a public health priority. To this end, we have constructed and purified recombinant ZIKV envelope protein using both prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems, and then tested their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in immune competent mice. Both protein immunogens elicited humoral and cellular immune responses, and protected immune competent mice from ZIKV challenge &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.

Like other tissues, skin is subject to temporal fluctuations in physiological responses under both homeostatic and stressed states. To gain insight into these fluctuations, we investigated the role of the circadian clock in the transcriptional regulation of epidermis using a hybrid experimental design, where a limited set of human subjects (n=20) were sampled throughout the 24 h cycle and a larger population (n=219) were sampled once. By looking at pairwise correlations of core clock genes in 298 skin samples, we found a robust circadian oscillator in skin at the population level. Encouraged by this, we used CYCLOPS to reconstruct the temporal order of all samples and identified hundreds of rhythmically-expressed genes at the population level in human skin. We compared these results with published time-series skin data from mouse and show strong concordance in circadian phase across species for both transcripts and pathways. Further, like blood, skin is readily accessible and a potential source of biomarkers. Using ZeitZeiger, we identified a biomarker set for human skin that is capable of reporting circadian phase to within 3 h from a single sample. In summary, we show rhythms in human skin that persist at the population scale and a path to develop robust single-sample circadian biomarkers.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301820v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/301820v2?rss=1</link><published>1523948400000</published><title>Population level rhythms in human skin: implications for circadian medicine [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>eabd0952</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Skin is the largest organ in the body and serves important barrier, regulatory, and sensory functions.

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the complex homeostatic regulatory relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study aimed to analyze the frequency-specific coupling function between cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentrations (delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) signals based on a model of coupled phase oscillators and dynamical Bayesian inference. Delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was measured by 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and arterial BP signals were obtained by simultaneous resting-state measurements in patients with stroke, that is, 9 with left hemiparesis (L–H group), 8 with right hemiparesis (R–H group), and 17 age-matched healthy individuals as control (healthy group). The coupling functions from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] oscillators were identified and analyzed in four frequency intervals (I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; and IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz). In L–H group, the CS from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in interval III in channel 8 was significantly higher than that in healthy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). Compared with the healthy controls, the coupling in MAP→delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] showed higher amplitude in interval I and IV in patients with stroke. The increased CS and coupling amplitude may be an evidence of impairment in CA, thereby confirming the presence of impaired CA in patients with stroke. In interval III, the CS in L–H group from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in channel 16 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls, which might indicate the compensatory mechanism in CA of the unaffected side in patients with stroke. No significant difference in region-wise CS between affected and unaffected sides was observed in stroke groups, indicating an evidence of globally impaired CA. These findings provide a method for the assessment of CA and will contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in stroke patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Alterations in the coupling functions between cerebral oxyhaemoglobin and arterial blood pressure signals in post-stroke subjects</title><fingerprint>479055e5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honglun Su, Congcong Huo, Bitian Wang, Wenhao Li, Gongcheng Xu, Qianying Liu, Zengyong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The inconclusive clinical results for ST-waveform analysis (STAN) in detecting fetal hypoxemia may be caused by the signal processing of the STAN-device itself. We assessed the performance of a clinical STAN device in signal processing and in detecting hypoxemia in a fetal sheep model exposed to prolonged umbilical cord occlusion (UCO).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight fetal lambs were exposed to 25 minutes of UCO. ECG recordings were analyzed during a baseline period and during UCO. STAN-event rates and timing of episodic T/QRS rise, baseline T/QRS rise and the occurrence of biphasic ST-waveforms, as well as signal loss, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During baseline conditions of normoxemia, a median of 40 (IQR, 25–70) STAN-events per minute were detected, compared to 10 (IQR, 2–22) during UCO. During UCO STAN-events were detected in five subjects within 10 minutes and in six subjects after 18 minutes, respectively. Two subjects did not generate any STAN-event during UCO. Biphasic ST event rate was reduced during UCO (median 0, IQR 0–5), compared to baseline (median 32, IQR, 6–55). ST-waveforms could not be assessed in 62% of the recording time during UCO, despite a good quality of the ECG signal.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The STAN device showed limitations in detecting hypoxemia in fetal sheep after prolonged UCO. The STAN device produced high false positive event rates during baseline and did not detect T/QRS changes adequately after prolonged fetal hypoxemia. During 14% of baseline and 62% of the UCO period, the STAN-device could not process the ECG signal, despite its good quality.

Kinetics of ligand-dependent IGF-IR endocytosis determines how IGF induces such downstream signaling outputs. Here, we find that the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)−1 modulates how long ligand-activated IGF-IR remains at the cell surface before undergoing endocytosis in mammalian cells. IRS-1 interacts with the clathrin adaptor complex AP2. IRS-1, but not an AP2-binding-deficient mutant, delays AP2-mediated IGF-IR endocytosis after the ligand stimulation. Mechanistically, IRS-1 inhibits the recruitment of IGF-IR into clathrin-coated structures; for this reason, IGF-IR avoids rapid endocytosis and prolongs its activity on the cell surface. Accelerating IGF-IR endocytosis via IRS-1 depletion induces the shift from sustained to transient Akt activation and augments FoxO-mediated transcription. Our study establishes a new role for IRS-1 as an endocytic regulator of IGF-IR that ensures sustained IGF bioactivity, independent of its classic role as an adaptor in IGF-IR signaling.</description><engagement>21</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32893</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) preferentially regulates the long-term IGF activities including growth and metabolism.

Our study establishes a new role for IRS-1 as an endocytic regulator of IGF-IR that ensures sustained IGF bioactivity, independent of its classic role as an adaptor in IGF-IR signaling.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32893</link><published>1523404800000</published><title>IRS-1 acts as an endocytic regulator of IGF-I receptor to facilitate sustained IGF signaling</title><fingerprint>b3eb1897</fingerprint><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162d30fda3e:309764d:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523959454270</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>2.1</engagementRate><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32893</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292029v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><author><name>Dhawan, A.</name></author><description>Oscillations are crucial to the sustenance of living organisms, across a wide variety of biological processes.

The annual return of beluga whales, &lt;i&gt;Delphinapterus leucas&lt;/i&gt;, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (&lt;i&gt;Φ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11–0.32, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0–0.02; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions.

The annual return of beluga whales, &lt;i&gt;Delphinapterus leucas&lt;/i&gt;, to traditional seasonal locations across the Arctic may involve migratory culture, while the convergence of discrete summering aggregations on common wintering grounds may facilitate outbreeding. Natal philopatry and cultural inheritance, however, has been difficult to assess as earlier studies were of too short a duration, while genetic analyses of breeding patterns, especially across the beluga’s Pacific range, have been hampered by inadequate sampling and sparse information on wintering areas. Using a much expanded sample and genetic marker set comprising 1,647 whales, spanning more than two decades and encompassing all major coastal summering aggregations in the Pacific Ocean, we found evolutionary-level divergence among three geographic regions: the Gulf of Alaska, the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, and the Sea of Okhotsk (&lt;i&gt;Φ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11–0.32, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09–0.13), and likely demographic independence of (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-mtDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02–0.66), and in many cases limited gene flow (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;st-nDNA&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0–0.02; &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; = 5–6) among, summering groups within regions. Assignment tests identified few immigrants within summering aggregations, linked migrating groups to specific summering areas, and found that some migratory corridors comprise whales from multiple subpopulations (P&lt;sub&gt;BAYES&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.31:0.69). Further, dispersal is male-biased and substantial numbers of closely related whales congregate together at coastal summering areas. Stable patterns of heterogeneity between areas and consistently high proportions (~20%) of close kin (including parent-offspring) sampled up to 20 years apart within areas (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; = 0.2–2.9, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.5) is the first direct evidence of natal philopatry to migration destinations in belugas.

This obviously is most important (and can have the biggest effect) if your compound has a short half-life after dosing to begin with (and plenty of compounds do). As the paper notes, if you have constant clearance for the unbound fraction of your compound, then the relationship between dose and half-life is exponential, not linear (whereas most of the other combinations you can come up with are simply linear ones). That really gives you a handle to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, you don’t have to wait until human data to worry about such things. The allometric scaling factor between rats and humans is about 4.3, so if you’ve done your homework about what the mechanisms of clearance are (which enzymes are responsible and how well they correlate to human ones, for example), you’re ready to work from there. The paper notes, though, that these sorts of correlations have a much higher chance of going haywire on you for very short half-life compounds (less than two hours, say), so if you want to have any confidence at all in your dose prediction models, you really should get rat half-life out longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group shows a plot of about 10,000 Merck compounds with rat measurements of unbound-clearance versus steady-state volume of distribution, and it’s (as you might figure) a pretty good correlation. The key, then, is to find changes in a molecule’s structure that will get it off that line, because otherwise you’ll end up in a similar situation to where you started. That is, you can find yourself reducing the unbound clearance and ending up with an effective half life that’s not really improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what sorts of modifications actually improve the half-life? The paper shows the result of a large matched-molecular-pairs (MMP) analysis, where structures were varied at only one place. Increasing lipophilicity will do the trick, sometimes, if the partitioning of your compound into tissue increases more than just its binding to plasma proteins. The Merck data suggest that adding multiple fluorines to a compound’s structure tends to have this effect. The fluorinated compounds tend, apparently, to bind to tissue at an increased rate more than they bind to serum albumin. You may or may not be comfortable with this advice, since polyfluorinated compounds may also be harder to formulate, and some of that tissue binding may be to things that you’d rather not bind to. But it will increase your half-life, and it’s up to each med-chem team to see if they want to make that deal with this particular fluorocarbon-coated devil. The free lunch has (still) not yet arrived in the lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, another classic way to increase half-life is to block sites of metabolism. The Merck group noted this in a general way with matched molecular pairs that changed hydrogens to chlorines, hydrogens to methyls, and methyls to chlorines. H to Cl increased half life, presumably for similar reasons to fluorination. H to methyl did not, though: that does increase lipophilicity, but at the expense of adding new groups for the liver enzymes to chew on. But methyl to chloro did improve half-lives, on average – the lipophilicities are nearly the same, but you’ve battened down the hatches for enzymatic degradation. (As you’d imagine, H to CF3 is the extreme example of this effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about replacing with more polar groups, rather than with nonstick coatings? On average, phenyl to pyridyl lowers half life, H to OH does too, and H to COOH &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lowers half-life. It’s worth noting that the carboxylic acids, overall, tend to have higher binding to plasma protein, so that tells you that the increased half-life of the halogenated compounds isn’t coming about by that mechanism, at least not exclusively. It’s worth noting, though, that just greasing up your compounds is not the answer. Fluorination and chlorination seem to work, but as a look at the broader MMP universe shows, increasing lipophilicity in general does not necessarily help your half-life. Decreasing lipophilicity, on the other hand, has a much better chance of hurting it. It looks, overall, as if the steady-state volume of distribution is more sensitive to modifications in the structure than is clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper has a list of groups that seem to help with increasing half-life, more often than not, and ones that seem to hurt. In addition to general halogenation, others in the first beneficial category include primary amines, NH pyrrolidines, piperidines, piperazines, and morpholines, 3,4-dihaloaryls, and (interestingly) 2-methyl-4-pyrimidones. In the likely-to-lower category, on the other hand, are pyridines and pyrimidines attached at the 2 position, N-attached pyrazoles (and other related 5-membered heterocycles that have that core), unsubstituted phenyls (and 4-pyridyls), primary alcohols, and simple cyclopropyls.

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months.

Muscle atrophy (loss of skeletal muscle mass) causes progressive deterioration of skeletal function. Recently, excessive intake of fats was suggested to induce insulin resistance, followed by muscle atrophy. Green tea extracts (GTEs), which contain polyphenols such as epigallocatechin gallate, have beneficial effects on obesity, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance, but their effects against muscle atrophy are still unclear. Here, we found that GTEs prevented high-fat (HF) diet–induced muscle weight loss in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), a murine model of senescence. SAMP8 mice were fed a control diet, an HF diet, or HF with 0.5% GTEs (HFGT) diet for 4 months. The HF diet induced muscle weight loss with aging (measured as quadriceps muscle weight), whereas GTEs prevented this loss. In HF diet–fed mice, blood glucose and plasma insulin concentrations increased in comparison with the control group, and these mice had insulin resistance as determined by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). In these mice, serum concentrations of leukocyte cell–derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2), which is known to induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, were elevated, and insulin signaling in muscle, as determined by the phosphorylation levels of Akt and p70 S6 kinases, tended to be decreased. In HFGT diet–fed mice, these signs of insulin resistance and elevation of serum LECT2 were not observed. Although our study did not directly show the effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, insulin resistance examined using HOMA-IR indicated an intervention effect of serum LECT2 on muscle weight, as revealed by partial correlation analysis. Accordingly, GTEs might have beneficial effects on age-related and HF diet–induced muscle weight loss, which correlates with insulin resistance and is accompanied by a change in serum LECT2.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195753</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a4:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/524/eaan8804?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><author><name>Labandera, A.-M., Uhrig, R.

In recent years, acupuncture has gained in popularity worldwide. However, recent epidemiological studies are lacking. We conducted this study to investigate the trends in acupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. We analyzed data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID 2000), which contains all original claims data for 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from the registry of all beneficiaries enrolled in the National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 2000. The one-year prevalence of acupuncture use among adults increased from 7.98% in 2002 to 10.9% in 2011. Acupuncture use significantly increased yearly (incidence rate ratio = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03−1.05, p&amp;lt;0.001). Patients who were female, were middle-aged, resided in highly urbanized areas and suffered from injury or disorders of the musculoskeletal system were prone to more frequent acupuncture use. Our study revealed that the utilization of acupuncture became increasingly popular in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011. Our findings may provide useful information for clinical practice and research as well as for health policy decision making.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195490</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Trends in use of acupuncture among adults in Taiwan from 2002 to 2011: A nationwide population-based study</title><fingerprint>95378d3e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mei-Yao Wu, Yu-Chen Lee, Cheng-Li Lin, Ming-Cheng Huang, Mao-Feng Sun, Hung-Rong Yen&lt;/p&gt;

HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response. There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles. The impact of using homology models on the docking performance and how using different parameters such as including receptor flexibility affected the docking performance, were also investigated to simulate the approach where a crystal structure for a given HLA allele may be unavailable. The programs that were best able to predict the binding position of Abacavir were then used to recreate the docking seen for Carbamazepine with B*15:02 and controls alleles. It was found that the programmes investigated were sometimes able to correctly predict the binding mode of Abacavir with B*57:01 but not always. Each of the software packages that were assessed could predict the binding of Abacavir and Carbamazepine within the correct sub-pocket and, with the exception of ROSIE, was able to correctly distinguish between risk and control alleles. We found that docking to homology models could produce poorer quality predictions, especially when sequence differences impact the architecture of predicted binding pockets. Caution must therefore be used as inaccurate structures may lead to erroneous docking predictions. Incorporating receptor flexibility was found to negatively affect the docking performance for the examples investigated. Taken together, our findings help characterise the potential but also the limitations of computational prediction of drug-HLA interactions. These docking techniques should therefore always be used with care and alongside other methods of investigation, in order to be able to draw strong conclusions from the given results.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296574v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/296574v1?rss=1</link><published>1522998000000</published><title>Critical assessment of approaches for molecular docking to elucidate associations of HLA alleles with Adverse Drug Reactions [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>93ed513a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Adverse drug reactions have been linked with genetic polymorphisms in HLA genes in numerous different studies.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194868</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bb:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194777</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Mohammed Saqr</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammed Saqr, Uno Fors, Matti Tedre, Jalal Nouri&lt;/p&gt;
To ensure online collaborative learning meets the intended pedagogical goals (is actually collaborative and stimulates learning), mechanisms are needed for monitoring the efficiency of online collaboration. Various studies have indicated that social network analysis can be particularly effective in studying students’ interactions in online collaboration. However, research in education has only focused on the theoretical potential of using SNA, not on the actual benefits they achieved. This study investigated how social network analysis can be used to monitor online collaborative learning, find aspects in need of improvement, guide an informed intervention, and assess the efficacy of intervention using an experimental, observational repeated-measurement design in three courses over a full-term duration. Using a combination of SNA-based visual and quantitative analysis, we monitored three SNA constructs for each participant: the level of interactivity, the role, and position in information exchange, and the role played by each participant in the collaboration. On the group level, we monitored interactivity and group cohesion indicators. Our monitoring uncovered a non-collaborative teacher-centered pattern of interactions in the three studied courses as well as very few interactions among students, limited information exchange or negotiation, and very limited student networks dominated by the teacher. An intervention based on SNA-generated insights was designed. The intervention was structured into five actions: increasing awareness, promoting collaboration, improving the content, preparing teachers, and finally practicing with feedback. Evaluation of the intervention revealed that it has significantly enhanced student-student interactions and teacher-student interactions, as well as produced a collaborative pattern of interactions among most students and teachers. Since efficient and communicative activities are essential prerequisites for successful content discussion and for realizing the goals of collaboration, we suggest that our SNA-based approach will positively affect teaching and learning in many educational domains. Our study offers a proof-of-concept of what SNA can add to the current tools for monitoring and supporting teaching and learning in higher education.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194777</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194777</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>How social network analysis can be used to monitor online collaborative learning and guide an informed intervention</title><fingerprint>beef5ab5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammed Saqr, Uno Fors, Matti Tedre, Jalal Nouri&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Common colds are the most frequently encountered disease worldwide and the most frequent reason for self-care. According to the cross-sectional European Common Colds study (COCO), patients use as many as 12 items on average for self-care. Little is known about the influence of discomfort and knowledge on self-care for common colds.&lt;/p&gt; Main objective &lt;p&gt;To understand the influence of patients’ discomfort during a cold and their knowledge about the self-limited disease course on the use of self-care measures.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This COCO analysis included 2,204 patients from 22 European primary care sites in 12 countries. Each site surveyed 120 consecutive adults with a 27-item questionnaire asking about patients’ self-care, subjective discomfort during a cold (discomfort: yes/no), and knowledge about the self-limited course (yes/no). Country-specific medians of the number of self-care items served as a cut-off to define high and low self-care use. Four groups were stratified based on discomfort (yes/no) and knowledge (yes/no).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Participants’ mean age was 46.5 years, 61.7% were female; 36.3% lacked knowledge; 70.6% reported discomfort. The group &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the highest mean item use (13.3), followed by &lt;i&gt;has discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.9), &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/no knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (11.1), and &lt;i&gt;no discomfort/has knowledge&lt;/i&gt; (8.8). High use was associated with discomfort (OR 1.8; CI 1.5–2.2), female gender (OR 1.7; 1.4–2.0), chronic pain/arthritis (OR 1.6; 1.2–2.1), more years of education (OR 1.3; 1.1–1.6), age &amp;lt;48 years (OR 1.3; 1.0–1.5), and lack of knowledge (OR 1.2; 1.0–1.4).&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Counseling on common colds should address patients’ discomfort and soothing measures in addition to providing information on the natural disease course.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195564</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195564</link><published>1523653200000</published><title>Self-care for common colds: A European multicenter survey on the role of subjective discomfort and knowledge about the self-limited course - The COCO study</title><fingerprint>a75a52e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anika Thielmann, Biljana Gerasimovska-Kitanovska, Tuomas H.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;As atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic, it may remain undiagnosed until or even after development of complications, such as stroke. Consequently the observed prevalence of AF may underestimate total disease burden.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the United States, we performed a retrospective cohort modeling study in working age (18–64) and elderly (≥65) people using commercial and Medicare administrative claims databases. We identified patients in years 2004–2010 with incident AF following an ischemic stroke. Using a back-calculation methodology, we estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed AF as the ratio of the number of post-stroke AF patients and the CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-specific stroke probability for each patient, adjusting for age and gender composition based on United States census data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The estimated prevalence of AF (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was 3,873,900 (95%CI: 3,675,200–4,702,600) elderly and 1,457,100 (95%CI: 1,218,500–1,695,800) working age adults, representing 10.0% and 0.92% of the respective populations. Of these, 698,900 were undiagnosed: 535,400 (95%CI: 331,900–804,400) elderly and 163,500 (95%CI: 17,700–400,000) working age adults, representing 1.3% and 0.09% of the respective populations. Among all undiagnosed cases, 77% had a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥1, and 56% had CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Using a back-calculation approach, we estimate that the total AF prevalence in 2009 was 5.3 million of which 0.7 million (13.1% of AF cases) were undiagnosed.

Comparative genomics of E. faecium will help to reveal the genomic differences responsible for the said properties. In this study, we compared E. faecium strain 17OM39 with a marketed probiotic, non-pathogenic non-probiotic (NPNP) and pathogenic strains. The core genome analysis revealed, 17OM39 was closely related with marketed probiotic strain T110. Strain 17OM39 was found to be devoid of known vancomycin, tetracycline resistance genes and functional virulence genes. Moreover, 17OM39 is &apos;less open&apos; due to absence of frequently found transposable elements. Genes imparting beneficial functional properties were observed to be present in marketed probiotic T110 and 17OM39 strains. Additional, genes associated with colonization within gastrointestinal tract were detected across all the strains. Beyond shared genetic features; this study particularly identified genes that are responsible to impart probiotic, non-pathogenic and pathogenic features to the strains of E. faecium. The study also provides insights into the acquired and intrinsic drug resistance genes, which will be helpful for better understanding of the physiology of antibiotic resistance in E. faecium strains. In addition, we could identify genes contributing to the intrinsic ability of 17OM39 E. faecium isolate to be a potential probiotic. The study has comprehensively characterized genome sequence of each strain to find the genetic variation and understand effects of these on functionality, phenotypic complexity. Further the evolutionary relationship of species along with adaptation strategies have been including in this study.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/295881v1?rss=1</link><published>1522911600000</published><title>Comparative Genome Analysis Reveals Important Genetic Factors Associated with Probiotic Property in Enterococcus faecium strains [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>3c1060a5</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Enterococcus faecium though commensals in human gut, few strains provide beneficial effect to humans as probiotics, few are responsible for nosocomial infection and few as non-pathogens.

&lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; is the causative agent of melioidosis and regarded as a bioterrorism threat. It can adapt to the nutrient-limited environment as the bacteria can survive in triple distilled water for 16 years. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; exhibits intrinsic resistance to diverse groups of antibiotics in particular while growing in biofilms. Recently, nutrient-limited condition influenced both biofilm formation and ceftazidime (CAZ) tolerance of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; were found. However, there is no information about how nutrient-limitation together with antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment affects the structure of the biofilm produced by &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, no comparative study to investigate the biofilm architectures of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and the related &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; under different nutrient concentrations has been reported. Therefore, this study aims to provide new information on the effects of four antibiotics used in melioidosis treatment, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;. ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMI), meropenem (MEM) and doxycycline (DOX) on biofilm architecture of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; with different nutrient concentrations under static and flow conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; grown planktonically or as biofilm was also evaluated. The findings of this study indicate that nutrient-limited environment enhanced survival of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm after exposure to the tested antibiotics. The shedding planktonic &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; were also found to have increased CAZ tolerance in nutrient-limited environment. However, killing activities of MEM and IMI were stronger than CAZ and DOX on &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; both in planktonic cells and in 2-day old biofilm.

Differences in biofilm architecture were observed for biofilms grown under static and flow conditions. Under static conditions, biofilms grown in full strength modified Vogel and Bonner’s medium (MVBM) showed honeycomb-like architecture while a knitted-like structure was observed under limited nutrient condition (0.1×MVBM). Under flow conditions, biofilms grown in MVBM showed a multilayer structure while merely dispersed bacteria were found when grown in 0.1×MVBM. Altogether, this study provides more insight on the effect of four antibiotics against &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thailandensis&lt;/i&gt; in biofilm under different nutrient and flow conditions. Since biofilm formation is believed to be involved in disease relapse, MEM and IMI may be better therapeutic options than CAZ for melioidosis treatment.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194946</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194946</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Impact of nutritional stress on drug susceptibility and biofilm structures of &amp;lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Burkholderia thailandensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; grown in static and microfluidic systems</title><fingerprint>da2818f0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chitchanok Anutrakunchai, Jan G.

Mimicry can occur in several contexts, including sexual interactions. In some cases, males mimic females to gain access to potential mates. In contrast, there are relatively few examples of species where females mimic males, and we know very little about what drives these patterns. Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain female mimicry of males. The first is that mimicry is used to reduce harassment of females by males. The second is that mimicry is used to display dominance over other females. In this study, we tested these hypotheses in &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes, wherein females of several species have pigmentation on their anal fin of the same coloration and shape, and in the same location, as the genitalia of males. To test if female mimicry of males reduces male harassment, we experimentally manipulated female pigmentation and observed male preference for females with and without male-like pigmentation. To test the effect that female mimicry of males has on female dominance, we observed how females respond to anal fin pigmentation patterns of companion females. We found that neither of these hypotheses was supported by our data. We conclude that similarities in anal fin pigmentation between male and female &lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&lt;/i&gt; fishes is not an adaptation to reduce male harassment or to signal dominance between females. Alternative explanations must exist, including the possibility that these similarities are simply non-adaptive.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194121</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Anal fin pigmentation in &amp;lt;i&gt;Brachyrhaphis&amp;lt;/i&gt; fishes is not used for sexual mimicry</title><fingerprint>410901e9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kandace M.

Results: In current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in early and late stage using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset contains 173 early and 177 late stage samples of LIHC, was extensively analysed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early and late stages of LIHC samples with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC 0.58 with accuracy 78.87% on validation dataset. Further, we also analysed genomics and epigenomics profiles of normal and LIHC samples and developed model to classify LIHC samples with AUROC 0.99. In addition, multiclass models developed for classifying samples in normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved accuracy of 76.54% and AUROC of 0.86. Conclusion: Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to classification of LIHC and normal samples.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular events, with a corresponding growth in medical costs. High intensity lifestyle intervention (HILI) is the cornerstone for weight management. We assessed the effectiveness of clinic-based HILI on weight loss and associated clinical outcomes by duration of program participation and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who enrolled in HILI weight management programs at Health Management Resources (HMR) clinics located across the U.S. Patients completed health risk assessments (HRA) and were enrolled for up to 24 months at the time of follow-up HRA. HMR programs provide weekly group coaching to achieve reduced calorie intake, increased fruit/vegetable intake, and physical activity ≥2,000 kcal/wk. A Markov model predicted avoidance of diabetes and cardiovascular events and projected cost savings due to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 500 patients included in the analysis, 67% were female and mean age was 54.1 years (s.d. 11.6). The baseline weight and BMI were 243.5 lbs (range 144.0–545.0) and 38.8 kg/m2 (range 25.4–85.0), respectively. Overall, patients lost an average of 47.4 lbs (18.9% of initial body weight [IBW]); the amount of weight loss was consistent among those with diabetes/pre-diabetes (50%), high/moderate risk for dyslipidemia (60%), hypertension/pre-hypertension (86%), and severe obesity (37%). The mean IBW lost was 16.4%, 19.3%, 20.7% for ≤6 months (n = 165), 7–12 months (n = 140), 13–24 months (n = 195) of program participation, respectively. The simulation model estimated 22 diabetes and 30 cardiovascular events and $1,992,370 medical costs avoided over 5 years in the 500 patients evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Patients in the HMR clinic-based HILI program achieved substantial weight loss regardless of duration of program participation, risk profile and comorbid status. The HMR program could be an effective strategy to prevent costly diabetes and cardiovascular events, particularly in high risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195794</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195794</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>High intensity lifestyle intervention and long-term impact on weight and clinical outcomes</title><fingerprint>ea771b4c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Gotthelf, Ya-Ting Chen, Srinivasan Rajagopalan, Elise Chi-Tao Wu, Ishita Doshi, Carol Addy&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The growing shale gas (“fracking”) industry depends on a mobile workforce, whose influx could have social impacts on host communities. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can increase through sexual mixing patterns associated with labor migration. No prior studies have quantified the relationship between shale gas activity and rates of three reportable STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal, ecologic study from 2000–2016 in Ohio, situated in a prolific shale gas region in the United States (US). Data on reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis by county and year were obtained from the Ohio Department of Health. All 88 counties were classified as none, low, and high shale gas activity in each year, using data from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.

It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy. BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies. BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome. BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers. The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers. BFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads. It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read. This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs. BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST. BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST. There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data. BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well. Results: BisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies. Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly. BisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data. On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent. BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads. Other read mappers had worse performance. Conclusions: BisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data. BisPin is feature-rich. This makes BisPin and BFAST-Gap useful additions to read mapping software.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284596v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284596v1?rss=1</link><published>1521442800000</published><title>BisPin and BFAST-Gap: Mapping Bisulfite-Treated Reads [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>f64a5881</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: BisPin is a new multiprocess bisulfite-treated short DNA read mapper written in Python 2.7. It performs alignments using BFAST, leveraging its multithreading functionality and thorough hash-based indexing strategy. BisPin is feature rich and supports directional, nondirectional, PBAT, and hairpin construction strategies. BisPin approaches read mapping by converting the Cs to Ts and the Gs to As in both the reads and the reference genome. BisPin uses fast rescoring to disambiguate ambiguously aligned reads for a superior amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers. The performance of BisPin was evaluated on both real and simulated data in comparison to other read mappers. BFAST-Gap is a modified version of BFAST meant for Ion Torrent reads. It uses a parameterized logistic function to determine the weights of the gap open and extension penalties based on the homopolymer run length of the DNA read. This is because the Ion Torrent sequencing technology can overcall and undercall homopolymer runs. BisPin works with both BFAST-Gap and BFAST. BFAST-Gap is compatible with indexes built with BFAST. There are few mappers that specifically address Ion Torrent data. BFAST-Gap works with Illumina reads as well. Results: BisPin with BFAST consistently had a higher amount of uniquely mapped reads compared to other mappers on real data using a variety of construction strategies. Using a hairpin validation strategy, BisPin was superior using the maximum score, and it mapped 73% of reads correctly. BisPin with BFAST-Gap on Ion Torrent reads with a logistic gap open penalty function improved mapping accuracy with real and simulated data. On simulated bisulfite Ion Torrent data, the area under the curve was improved by approximately seven, and on one real data set, the uniquely mapped percent was improved by seven percent. BFAST-Gap performed better than TMAP on simulated regular Ion Torrent reads, and TMAP is designed for Ion Torrent reads. Other read mappers had worse performance. Conclusions: BisPin and BFAST-Gap have consistently good accuracy with a variety of data. BisPin is feature-rich. This makes BisPin and BFAST-Gap useful additions to read mapping software.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/19/284596</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1623dec0e00:2606f9f:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521457303040</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><engagement>1</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-q?rss=1</link><published>1523554636000</published><title>Climate effects of aerosol cleanup</title><fingerprint>e7abb08b</fingerprint><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/166.17.full</canonicalUrl><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162bb0f77b0:feced0:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523556775856</crawled><unread>True</unread><engagementRate>0.02</engagementRate></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195150</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195150</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195150</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Correction: Women’s reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and practices in relation to the Zika virus outbreak in northeast Brazil</title><fingerprint>b6660ea6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195150</canonicalUrl><updated>1522098000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626374dad7:5af0af1:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522087025367</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E2940.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Katarina Stanko, Christina Iwert, Christine Appelt, Katrin Vogt, Julia Schumann, Franziska Janina Strunk, Stefanie Ahrlich, Stephan Schlickeiser, Chiara Romagnani, Karsten Jurchott, Christian Meisel, Gerald Willimsky, Anȷa A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The need to evaluate the human health safety of fishery resources remain urgent in the mist of the ever-increasing fear of heavy metal toxicity from the consumption of Ghana’s fisheries resource, as a consequence of pollution from several anthropogenic activities including artisanal gold mining. Nevertheless, the bigeye grunt (&lt;i&gt;Brachydeuterus auritus&lt;/i&gt;) and Bagrid catfish (&lt;i&gt;Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt;) remain commercially valuable fish species in West Africa and continue to attract high patronage.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Forty-five specimens each of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nigrodigitatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt; collected from the Weija Dam and the Tema Fishing Habour in Ghana, between June and September 2016, were analysed for seven heavy metals using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Lead and Cadmium were below detection in all samples while Cu was not detected in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auritus&lt;/i&gt;.

Nevertheless, the degree of conservation in regulatory mechanism is lower than that of expression, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/22/286211</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1624ca5b30f:3cab45e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521704350479</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265256v3?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Arnol, D.</name></author><description>Technological advances allow for assaying multiplexed spatially resolved RNA and protein expression profiling of individual cells, thereby capturing physiological tissue contexts of single cell variation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Segmentation of heterogeneous patient populations into parsimonious and relatively homogenous groups with similar healthcare needs can facilitate healthcare resource planning and development of effective integrated healthcare interventions for each segment. We aimed to apply a data-driven, healthcare utilization-based clustering analysis to segment a regional health system patient population and validate its discriminative ability on 4-year longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality data.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We extracted data from the Singapore Health Services Electronic Health Intelligence System, an electronic medical record database that included healthcare utilization (inpatient admissions, specialist outpatient clinic visits, emergency department visits, and primary care clinic visits), mortality, diseases, and demographics for all adult Singapore residents who resided in and had a healthcare encounter with our regional health system in 2012. Hierarchical clustering analysis (Ward’s linkage) and K-means cluster analysis using age and healthcare utilization data in 2012 were applied to segment the selected population. These segments were compared using their demographics (other than age) and morbidities in 2012, and longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 146,999 subjects, five distinct patient segments “Young, healthy”; “Middle age, healthy”; “Stable, chronic disease”; “Complicated chronic disease” and “Frequent admitters” were identified. Healthcare utilization patterns in 2012, morbidity patterns and demographics differed significantly across all segments. The “Frequent admitters” segment had the smallest number of patients (1.79% of the population) but consumed 69% of inpatient admissions, 77% of specialist outpatient visits, 54% of emergency department visits, and 23% of primary care clinic visits in 2012. 11.5% and 31.2% of this segment has end stage renal failure and malignancy respectively. The validity of cluster-analysis derived segments is supported by discriminative ability for longitudinal healthcare utilization and mortality from 2013–2016. Incident rate ratios for healthcare utilization and Cox hazards ratio for mortality increased as patient segments increased in complexity. Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Assessing the validity of a data driven segmentation approach: A 4 year longitudinal study of healthcare utilization and mortality</title><fingerprint>dfc2be54</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Leng Low, Shi Yan, Yu Heng Kwan, Chuen Seng Tan, Julian Thumboo&lt;/p&gt;

Patients in the “Frequent admitters” segment accounted for a disproportionate healthcare utilization and 8.16 times higher mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data-driven clustering analysis on a general patient population in Singapore identified five patient segments with distinct longitudinal healthcare utilization patterns and mortality risk to provide an evidence-based segmentation of a regional health system’s healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195243</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4604:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.50</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Sarah Crunkhorn</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.50&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/Np_EKVRfb4E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.50</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/Np_EKVRfb4E/nrd.2018.50</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.50</link><published>1522220400000</published><title>Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine</title><fingerprint>ae5c574a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine, Published online: 28 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.50&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Infectious disease: Virus-based tuberculosis vaccine&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/Np_EKVRfb4E&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_1626b359a97:669eb47:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522217097879</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaap8562?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><author><name>Tastanova, A., Folcher, M., Müller, M., Camenisch, G., Ponti, A., Horn, T., Tikhomirova, M.

Because many medical conditions progress asymptomatically over extended periods of time, their timely diagnosis remains difficult, and this adversely affects patient prognosis. Focusing on hypercalcemia associated with cancer, we aimed to develop a synthetic biology-inspired biomedical tattoo using engineered cells that would (i) monitor long-term blood calcium concentration, (ii) detect onset of mild hypercalcemia, and (iii) respond via subcutaneous accumulation of the black pigment melanin to form a visible tattoo. For this purpose, we designed cells containing an ectopically expressed calcium-sensing receptor rewired to a synthetic signaling cascade that activates expression of transgenic tyrosinase, which produces melanin in response to persistently increased blood Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. We confirmed that the melanin-generated color change produced by this biomedical tattoo could be detected with the naked eye and optically quantified. The system was validated in wild-type mice bearing subcutaneously implanted encapsulated engineered cells. All animals inoculated with hypercalcemic breast and colon adenocarcinoma cells developed tattoos, whereas no tattoos were seen in animals inoculated with normocalcemic tumor cells. All tumor-bearing animals remained asymptomatic throughout the 38-day experimental period.

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>A Rac1-FMNL2 signaling module affects cell-cell contact formation independent of Cdc42 and membrane protrusions</title><fingerprint>f712f6c3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;

We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor.

We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Paraquat poisoning can result in dysfunction of multiple organs, and pulmonary fibrosis with respiratory failure is the major cause of mortality.

Patients were hospitalized at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taitung Branch, Taiwan, between 2005 to April 2016. Composite outcomes of intra-hospital mortality, the rate of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, prescribed medications, length of stay, and medical costs were recorded and compared between the do-not-intubate (DNI) group and endotracheal intubation (EI) group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Intra-hospital mortality rate for the entire population was 100%.

Gene regulation at the transcriptional level is a central process in all organisms, and DNA-binding transcription factors, known as TFs, play a fundamental role. This class of proteins usually binds at specific DNA sequences, activating or repressing gene expression. In general, TFs are composed of two domains: the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and an extra domain, which in this work we have named “companion domain” (CD). This latter could be involved in one or more functions such as ligand binding, protein-protein interactions or even with enzymatic activity. In contrast to DBDs, which have been widely characterized both experimentally and bioinformatically, information on the abundance, distribution, variability and possible role of the CDs is scarce. Here, we investigated these issues associated with the domain architectures of TFs in prokaryotic genomes. To this end, 19 families of TFs in 761 non-redundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were evaluated. In this regard we found four main groups based on the abundance and distribution in the analyzed genomes: i) LysR and TetR/AcrR; ii) AraC/XylS, SinR, and others; iii) Lrp, Fis, ArsR, and others; and iv) a group that included only two families, ArgR and BirA. Based on a classification of the organisms according to the life-styles, a major abundance of regulatory families in free-living organisms, in contrast with pathogenic, extremophilic or intracellular organisms, was identified. Finally, the protein architecture diversity associated to the 19 families considering a weight score for domain promiscuity evidenced which regulatory families were characterized by either a large diversity of CDs, here named as “promiscuous” families given the elevated number of variable domains found in those TFs, or a low diversity of CDs. Altogether this information helped us to understand the diversity and distribution of the 19 Prokaryotes TF families. Moreover, initial steps were taken to comprehend the variability of the extra domain in those TFs, which eventually might assist in evolutionary and functional studies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195332</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Abundance, diversity and domain architecture variability in prokaryotic DNA-binding transcription factors</title><fingerprint>993d9672</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ernesto Perez-Rueda, Rafael Hernandez-Guerrero, Mario Alberto Martinez-Nuñez, Dagoberto Armenta-Medina, Israel Sanchez, J.

However, recent studies (Kuipers et al., 2017) leveraging Single-cell Sequencing (SCS) techniques have shown evidence of the widespread recurrence and, especially, loss of mutations in several tumor samples. Still, established methods that can infer phylogenies with mutation losses are however lacking. Results: We present the SASC (Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference) tool which is a new and robust approach based on simulated annealing for the inference of cancer progression from SCS data. More precisely, we introduce a simple extension of the model of evolution where mutations are only accumulated, by allowing also a limited amount of back mutations in the evolutionary history of the tumor: the Dollo-k model. We demonstrate that SASC achieves high levels of accuracy when tested on both simulated and real data sets and in comparison with some other available methods.

However, both types of disease mutations are gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a &lt;i&gt;Ptpn11&lt;/i&gt; allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3.

Wildlife mortality investigations are important for conservation, food safety, and public health; but they are infrequently reported for cryptic chelonian species. Eastern box turtles (&lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&lt;/i&gt;) are declining due to anthropogenic factors and disease, and while mortality investigations have been reported for captive and translocated individuals, few descriptions exist for free-living populations. We report the results of four natural mortality event investigations conducted during routine health surveillance of three Illinois box turtle populations in 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015. In April 2011, over 50 box turtles were found dead and a polymicrobial necrotizing bacterial infection was diagnosed in five survivors using histopathology and aerobic/anaerobic culture. This represents the first reported occurrence of necrotizing bacterial infection in box turtles. In August 2013, paired histopathology and qPCR ranavirus detection in nine turtles was significantly associated with occupation of moist microhabitats, identification of oral plaques and nasal discharge on physical exam, and increases in the heterophil count and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In July 2014 and 2015, ranavirus outbreaks reoccurred within a 0.2km radius of highly-disturbed habitat containing ephemeral ponds used by amphibians for breeding. qPCR ranavirus detection in five individuals each year was significantly associated with use of moist microhabitats (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Detection of single and co-pathogens (Terrapene herpesvirus 1, adenovirus, and &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma&lt;/i&gt; sp.) was common before, during, and after mortality events, but improved sample size would be necessary to determine the impacts of these pathogens on the occurrence and outcome of mortality events. This study provides novel information about the causes and predictors of natural box turtle mortality events. Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Investigation of multiple mortality events in eastern box turtles (&amp;lt;i&gt;Terrapene carolina carolina&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><fingerprint>2c9bb0c1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Adamovicz, Matthew C.

Continued investigation of health, disease, and death in free-living box turtles will improve baseline knowledge of morbidity and mortality, identify threats to survival, and promote the formation of effective conservation strategies.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195617</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d746:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/3205.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Felipe Merino, Stefan Raunser</name></author><description>Proper segregation of genetic material is a universal requirement for all living organisms.

Presently, third generation sequencing platforms able to generate much longer reads are becoming more widespread. These platforms come with the significant drawback of higher sequencing error rates, which make them ill-suited to current genotyping algorithms. However, the longer reads make more of the genome unambiguously mappable and typically provide linkage information between neighboring variants. Results: In this paper we introduce a novel approach for haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads. We do this by considering bipartitions of the sequencing reads, corresponding to the two haplotypes. We formalize the computational problem in terms of a Hidden Markov Model and compute posterior genotype probabilities using the forward-backward algorithm. Genotype predictions can then be made by picking the most likely genotype at each site. Our experiments indicate that longer reads allow significantly more of the genome to potentially be accurately genotyped. Further, we are able to independently validate with both Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences sequencing data millions of variants previously identified by short-read technologies in the reference NA12878 sample, including hundreds of thousands of variants that were not previously included in the high-confidence reference set.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/293944v1?rss=1</link><published>1522738800000</published><title>Haplotype-aware genotyping from noisy long reads [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>f6063ea8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Current genotyping approaches for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) rely on short, relatively accurate reads from second generation sequencing devices.

Niosomes are used in studies for drug delivery or gene transfer. However, their physical properties and features relative to liposomes are not well documented. To characterize and more rationally optimize niosome formulations, the properties of these vesicle systems are compared to those of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids plus cholesterol. Niosomes are highly stable and only slightly more leaky than liposomes as assayed by calcein leakage; the permeability for ions (KCl) is higher than that of liposomes. Contrary to liposomes, the size of niosomes decreases substantially upon freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing, as shown by cryo-EM and dynamic light scattering. The packing of niosomal membranes was determined by laurdan fluorescence and is slightly lower than that of liposomes. We did not succeed in the functional reconstitution of the L-arginine/L-ornithine antiporter ArcD2 in niosomes, which we attribute to the non-ionic nature of the surfactants. The antimicrobial peptides alamethicin and melittin act similarly on niosomes and liposomes composed of unsaturated components, whereas both niosomes and liposomes are unaffected when saturated amphiphiles are used. In conclusion, in terms of stability and permeability for drug-size molecules niosomes are comparable to liposomes and they may offer an excellent, inexpensive alternative for delivery purposes.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194179</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Niosomes, an alternative for liposomal delivery</title><fingerprint>3667a9ec</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rianne Bartelds, Mohammad Hadi Nematollahi, Tjeerd Pols, Marc C.

The importance of patch quality for amphibians is frequently overlooked in distribution models. Here we demonstrate that it is highly important for the persistence of endemic and endangered amphibians found in the threatened and fragile ecosystems that are the rocky plateaus in Western Maharashtra, India. These plateaus are ferricretes of laterite and characterise the northern section of the Western Ghats/Sri Lanka Biodiversity Hotspot, the eighth most important global hotspot and one of the three most threatened by population growth. We present statistically supported habitat associations for endangered and data-deficient Indian amphibians, demonstrating significant relationships between individual species and their microhabitats. Data were collected during early monsoon across two seasons. Twenty-one amphibian taxa were identified from 14 lateritic plateaus between 67 and 1179m above sea level. Twelve of the study taxa had significant associations with microhabitats using a stepwise analysis of the AICc subroutine (distLM, Primer-e, v7). Generalist taxa were associated with increased numbers of microhabitat types. Non-significant associations are reported for the remaining 9 taxa. Microhabitat distribution was spatially structured and driven by climate and human activity. Woody plants were associated with 44% of high-elevation taxa. Of the 8 low-elevation taxa 63% related to water bodies and 60% of those were associated with pools. Rock size and abundance were important for 33% of high elevation specialists. Three of the 4 caecilians were associated with rocks in addition to soil and stream presence. We conclude the plateaus are individualistic patches whose habitat quality is defined by their microhabitats within climatic zones.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194810</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194810</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Micro-habitat distribution drives patch quality for sub-tropical rocky plateau amphibians in the northern Western Ghats, India</title><fingerprint>b2123d08</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher J.

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections. Our results prove that the metabarcoding analysis is a promising approach to increases quality and sensitivity of the aerobiological monitoring.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the academic literature as alternatives to statistical ones for time series forecasting. Yet, scant evidence is available about their relative performance in terms of accuracy and computational requirements. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate such performance across multiple forecasting horizons using a large subset of 1045 monthly time series used in the M3 Competition. After comparing the post-sample accuracy of popular ML methods with that of eight traditional statistical ones, we found that the former are dominated across both accuracy measures used and for all forecasting horizons examined. Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194889</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Statistical and Machine Learning forecasting methods: Concerns and ways forward</title><fingerprint>8a626eb7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Spyros Makridakis, Evangelos Spiliotis, Vassilios Assimakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To determine the spectrum of infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and the clinical impact of the newly available betalactam/betalactamase inhibitor combinations ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam in a German academic tertiary care center.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between September 1, 2015 and August 31, 2016, 119 individual patients (0.22% of all hospital admissions) were colonized or infected with carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB. The species distribution was &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, n = 66; &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; spp., n = 44; and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, n = 18. In 9 patients, carbapenem-resistant isolates belonging to more than one species were detected. Infection was diagnosed in 50 patients (total: 42.0%; nosocomial pneumonia: n = 23, 19.3%; bloodstream infection: n = 11, 9.2%). Antimicrobial treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate was documented in 105 patients (88.2%, prior administration of carbapenems: 62.2%). Nosocomial transmission was documented in 29 patients (24.4%). In 26 patients (21.8%), at least one carbapenem-susceptible, third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible isolate was documented prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate belonging to the same species (median 38 days, IQR 23–78). 12 patients (10.1%) had documented previous contact to the healthcare system in a country with high burden of carbapenemase-producing strains. Genes encoding carbapenemases were detected in 60/102 patient isolates (58.8%; VIM-2, n = 25; OXA-48, n = 21; OXA-23-like, n = 10). Susceptibility to colistin was 94.3%. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were administered to 3 and 5 patients, respectively (in-hospital mortality: 66% and 100%). Development of drug-resistance under therapy was observed for both antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;i) The major predisposing factors for acquisition of carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB were selective pressure due to preceding antimicrobial therapy and nosocomial transmission. ii) Colistin remains the backbone of antimicrobial chemotherapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB. iii) Novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are of limited usefulness in our setting because of the high prevalence of Ambler class B carbapenemases and the emergence of nonsusceptibility under therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195757</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195757</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens in a German university medical center: Prevalence, clinical implications and the role of novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations</title><fingerprint>7e6e29db</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juri Katchanov, Lucia Asar, Eva-Maria Klupp, Anna Both, Camilla Rothe, Christina König, Holger Rohde, Stefan Kluge, Florian P.

Antimicrobial treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate was documented in 105 patients (88.2%, prior administration of carbapenems: 62.2%). Nosocomial transmission was documented in 29 patients (24.4%). In 26 patients (21.8%), at least one carbapenem-susceptible, third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible isolate was documented prior to detection of a carbapenem-resistant isolate belonging to the same species (median 38 days, IQR 23–78). 12 patients (10.1%) had documented previous contact to the healthcare system in a country with high burden of carbapenemase-producing strains. Genes encoding carbapenemases were detected in 60/102 patient isolates (58.8%; VIM-2, n = 25; OXA-48, n = 21; OXA-23-like, n = 10). Susceptibility to colistin was 94.3%. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were administered to 3 and 5 patients, respectively (in-hospital mortality: 66% and 100%). Development of drug-resistance under therapy was observed for both antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;i) The major predisposing factors for acquisition of carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB were selective pressure due to preceding antimicrobial therapy and nosocomial transmission. ii) Colistin remains the backbone of antimicrobial chemotherapy for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant MDR-GNB. iii) Novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are of limited usefulness in our setting because of the high prevalence of Ambler class B carbapenemases and the emergence of nonsusceptibility under therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195757</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66c2:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/E3827.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Seok Heo, Graham H.

The experiences of spouses caring for stroke survivors is condensed into topics and subtopics: “&lt;i&gt;Caregiving and that´s all”&lt;/i&gt; summarizes the sense of having no life horizons and also caregiver impossibility of moving away from caring role. Otherwise, “&lt;i&gt;Breaking the couple´s life together”&lt;/i&gt; enlightens the further consequences of stroke in couples shared live biography, which needs to be understood and rebuilt. Finally, “&lt;i&gt;Going through the (non) loss alone”&lt;/i&gt; alludes to how spouses reinterpret meaning of loss, which is not appreciated by others and that refers to the balance between stroke survival and any acquired global disability.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive approach to the couple (family), from a psycho-socio-emotional and relational perspective, is essential for ensuring adequate quality of life for people who suffered a stroke as well as their caregivers. Spouses-caregivers must be considered as individuals living a transition process due to their unexpected disrupting change, which nurses should address through a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on transition care.

Care resources must be adapted to the interpretation that the spouses have of their caregiving role and their relationship with the different components of the caregiving process.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195190</canonicalUrl><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f2:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS0092867418302964%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D711e24f97d4b4035b3facdd227b9a60f</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://rss.sciencedirect.com/publication/science/7051</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.sciencedirect.com</htmlUrl><title>ScienceDirect Publication: Cell</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Publication date: &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell, Volume 173, Issue 2&lt;br&gt; Author(s): Nan Liu, Victoria V.

Being generally regarded as commensal bacteria, the pro-inflammatory capacity of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt; species has long been debated. Recently, we confirmed &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt;–driven pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and a disturbance of cytokine equilibrium in primary human monocytes &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The present study addressed the expression of CC chemokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in purified term neonatal and adult monocytes stimulated with serovar 8 of &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma urealyticum&lt;/i&gt; (Uu) and serovar 3 of &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parvum&lt;/i&gt; (Up). Using qRT-PCR and multi-analyte immunoassay, we assessed mRNA and protein expression of the monocyte chemotactic proteins 1 and 3 (MCP-1/3), the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β (MIP-1α/β) as well as MMP-9. For the most part, both isolates stimulated mRNA expression of all given chemokines and MMP-9 in cord blood and adult monocytes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). These results were paralleled by Uu and Up-induced secretion of MCP-1 protein in both cells (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Release of MCP-3, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and MMP-9 was enhanced upon exposure to Up (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, respectively; adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Co-stimulation of LPS-primed monocytes with Up increased LPS-induced MCP-1 release in neonatal cells (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) and aggravated LPS-induced MMP-9 mRNA in both cell subsets (neonatal: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, adult: &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Our results document considerable expression of pro-inflammatory CC chemokines and MMP-9 in human monocytes in response to &lt;i&gt;Ureaplasma&lt;/i&gt; isolates &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, adding to our previous data.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Context matters (but how and why?)

We found that for almost all phenotypes considered standard machine learning methods outperformed the methods from classical statistical genetics. On the yeast problem, the most successful method was GBM, followed by lasso regression, and the two statistical genetics methods; with greater mechanistic complexity GBM was best, while in simpler cases lasso was superior. When applied to the wheat and rice studies the best two methods were SVM and BLUP. The most robust method in the presence of noise, missing data, etc. was random forests. The classical statistical genetics method of genomic BLUP was found to perform well on problems where there was population structure, which suggests one way to improve standard machine learning methods when population structure is present.

Viruses in avian hosts can pose threats to avian health and some have zoonotic potential. Hospitals that provide veterinary care for avian patients may serve as a site of exposure of other birds and human staff in the facility to these viruses. They can also provide a useful location to collect samples from avian patients in order to examine the viruses present in wild birds. This study aimed to investigate viruses of biosecurity and/or zoonotic significance in Australian birds by screening samples collected from 409 birds presented to the Australian Wildlife Health Centre at Zoos Victoria’s Healesville Sanctuary for veterinary care between December 2014 and December 2015. Samples were tested for avian influenza viruses, herpesviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, using genus- or family-wide polymerase chain reaction methods coupled with sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for detection and identification of both known and novel viruses. A very low prevalence of viruses was detected. &lt;i&gt;Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a powerful owl (&lt;i&gt;Ninox strenua&lt;/i&gt;) with inclusion body hepatitis, and an avian paramyxovirus most similar to &lt;i&gt;Avian avulavirus 5&lt;/i&gt; was detected from a musk lorikeet (&lt;i&gt;Glossopsitta concinna&lt;/i&gt;). Two distinct novel avian alphaherpesviruses were detected in samples from a sulphur-crested cockatoo (&lt;i&gt;Cacatua galerita&lt;/i&gt;) and a tawny frogmouth (&lt;i&gt;Podargus strigoides&lt;/i&gt;). Avian influenza viruses and avian coronaviruses were not detected. The clinical significance of the newly detected viruses remains undetermined. Further studies are needed to assess the host specificity, epidemiology, pathogenicity and host-pathogen relationships of these novel viruses. Further genome characterization is also indicated, and would be required before these viruses can be formally classified taxonomically. The detection of these viruses contributes to our knowledge on avian virodiversity. The low level of avian virus detection, and the absence of any viruses with zoonotic potential, suggests low risk to biosecurity and human health.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194457</link><published>1521838800000</published><title>Avian viral surveillance in Victoria, Australia, and detection of two novel avian herpesviruses</title><fingerprint>88d52e54</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jemima Amery-Gale, Carol A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In this qualitative study, we aimed to provide an in-depth exploration of cancer-related psychological distress experienced by young survivors of cancer during adolescence reporting a need for psychological support.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two individual interviews were held with ten young survivors of cancer diagnosed in adolescence. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Analysis followed the guidelines for inductive qualitative manifest content analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The survivors described distress experienced during and after the end of treatment. Five categories comprising 14 subcategories were generated. The categories included: A tough treatment, Marked and hindered, Not feeling good enough, Struggling with the fragility of life, and finally, An ongoing battle with emotions.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Young survivors of adolescent cancer reporting a need for psychological support described feeling physically, socially, and mentally marked by the cancer experience. They struggled with powerlessness, insecurity, social disconnection, loneliness, and feelings of being unimportant and a failure, and had difficulties understanding and managing their experiences. These concerns should be addressed in psychological treatments for the population irrespective of which approach or model is used to understand survivors’ difficulties.

A trans-diagnostic approach targeting processes that underpin different manifestations of distress may be effective.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195899</canonicalUrl><updated>1523998800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344159:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523986744698</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193995</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Roger A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Evidence remains limited on why diabetes and hypertensive patients admitted to long-term drug therapy miss doses or discontinue medication taking. We examined this phenomenon from the perspective of diabetes and hypertension patients at a Ghanaian teaching hospital.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Between July and December 2015, we conducted a qualitative study targeting caregivers and their patients with chronic diabetes and hypertensive on re-admission at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital due to non-adherence to prescribed medication. Participants were sampled purposefully and taking through in-depth interviews using an interview guide. Notes and audio recordings of interviews were transcribed, managed and coded for themes guided by the thematic network analysis recommended by Attride-Stirling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Non-adherence was the result of perceptions that the medications are not effective for managing the conditions. Patients with these perceptions rejected the medications and turned to herbal medicines and spiritual healing as therapeutic alternatives, because of their easy accessibility, perceived efficacy and affordability. Other factors identified to influence non-adherence included polypharmacy practice; tight work schedules; social norms; poor prescription instruction by health providers; and knowledge and experience of medication.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Findings suggests the need for health providers to adopt therapeutic approaches that take into account patients’ beliefs, values and norms in administering medications.

The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its version for groups (TSST-G) are the gold standard for inducing acute psychosocial stress in human experimental settings and have been used in numerous studies since the early 1990s. The TSST and the TSST-G lead to effects on different physiological and psychological markers, such as salivary cortisol, anxiety, and emotional states. These effects were assessed with quantitative methods comparing pre-test and post-test measures with statistical analyses. But to date, no qualitative analyses have been conducted to examine the meaningful experience of participants during the TSST and the TSST-G. This study is the first to conduct qualitative investigations to further clarify the stressful experience of participants confronted with these procedures. Preliminary results showed as expected that the TSST and the TSST-G effectively induced psychosocial stress, with cortisol levels, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and arousal increases, and with pleasure and dominance decreases. At the qualitative level, the results evidenced that the two theoretically stressful components of the TSST and the TSST-G, namely social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, were experienced as stress-inducing by the participants. Two case studies confirmed these findings. But the results also showed on one hand that psychosocial stress is a dynamic phenomenon, with important fluctuations throughout the tasks (mainly for the TSST-G); and on the other hand that despite the similar physiological and psychological responses between the TSST and the TSST-G evidenced by the literature, the experience of the participants was both similar and specific. Use of a qualitative method allowed us to provide a complementary point of view to understand the meaningful experience of participants during these stressful procedures, apprehending the dynamic of the subjective stress experience without disrupting it.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195722</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195722</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>The Trier Social Stress Test and the Trier Social Stress Test for groups: Qualitative investigations</title><fingerprint>88cbcef6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Vors, Tanguy Marqueste, Nicolas Mascret&lt;/p&gt;

Koalas (&lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&lt;/i&gt;) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of ‘wet bottom’, a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt;. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillales&lt;/i&gt;, within the &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families &lt;i&gt;Aerococcaceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four &lt;i&gt;Tissierellaceae&lt;/i&gt; OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pecorum&lt;/i&gt; and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194881</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194881</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Variation in the microbiome of the urogenital tract of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&amp;lt;/i&gt;-free female koalas (&amp;lt;i&gt;Phascolarctos cinereus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) with and without ‘wet bottom’</title><fingerprint>799512a9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alistair R.

Hydraulic fracturing can improve the permeability of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs effectively, which is of great significance to the commercial production of CBM. However, the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing is affected by multiple factors. The mechanism of fracture initiation, morphology and propagation in CBM reservoirs is not clear and need to be further explored. Hydraulic fracturing experiment is an accurate tool to explore these mechanisms. The quantity of experimental coal rock is large and processing method is complex, so specimen made of similar materials was applied to replace coal rock. The true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experimental apparatus, 3D scanning device for coal rock section were applied to carry out hydraulic fracturing experiment. The results show that the initiation pressure is inversely proportional to the horizontal stress difference (Δσ) and positively related to fracturing fluid injection rate. When vertical stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) is constant, the initiation pressure and fracture width decrease with the increasing of Δσ. Natural fractures can be connected by main fracture when propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), then secondary fractures and fracture network form in CBM reservoirs. When two stresses of crustal stress are close and far different from the third one, the fracture morphology and propagation become complex. Influenced by perforations and filtration of fracturing fluid in specimen, fracturing fluid flows to downward easily after comparing horizontal well fracturing with vertical well fracturing. Fracture width increases with the decreasing of elastic modulus, the intensity of fracture is positively related with the elastic modulus of coal rock. The research results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient development of CBM.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195363</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195363</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Experimental analysis of multiple factors on hydraulic fracturing in coalbed methane reservoirs</title><fingerprint>90602380</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fan Zhang, Geng Ma, Xiao Liu, Yunqi Tao, Dan Feng, Rui Li&lt;/p&gt;

The origin of the machinery that realizes protein biosynthesis in all organisms is still unclear. One key component of this machinery are aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRS), which ligate tRNAs to amino acids while consuming ATP. Sequence analyses revealed that these enzymes can be divided into two complementary classes. Both classes differ significantly on a sequence and structural level, feature different reaction mechanisms, and occur in diverse oligomerization states. The one unifying aspect of both classes is their function of binding ATP. We identified Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers as most compact ATP binding motifs characteristic for each Class. Geometric analysis shows a structural rearrangement of the Backbone Brackets upon ATP binding, indicating a general mechanism of all Class I structures. Regarding the origin of aaRS, the Rodin-Ohno hypothesis states that the peculiar nature of the two aaRS classes is the result of their primordial forms, called Protozymes, being encoded on opposite strands of the same gene. Backbone Brackets and Arginine Tweezers were traced back to the proposed Protozymes and their more efficient successors, the Urzymes. Both structural motifs can be observed as pairs of residues in contemporary structures and it seems that the time of their addition, indicated by their placement in the ancient aaRS, coincides with the evolutionary trace of Proto- and Urzymes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZqNwxiUByA0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d3:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Kaiser, Sebastian Bittrich, Sebastian Salentin, Christoph Leberecht, V.

The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is an evolutionary conserved cholesterol binding protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Expression of TSPO is upregulated in activated microglia in various neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and neoplastic disorders. Therefore, TSPO radioligands are used as biomarkers in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. In particular, a common A147T polymorphism in the TSPO gene affects binding of several high affinity TSPO radioligands. Given the relevance of TSPO as a diagnostic biomarker in disease processes, we systematically searched for mutations in the human TSPO gene by a wide array of evolution and structure based bioinformatics tools and identified potentially deleterious missense mutations. The two most frequently observed missense mutations A147T and R162H were further analysed in structural models of human wildtype and mutant TSPO proteins. The effects of missense mutations were studied on the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations. To analyse putative effects of A147T and R162H variants on protein stability we established primary dermal fibroblast cultures from wt and homozygous A147T and R162H donors. Stability of endogenous TSPO protein, which is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts, was studied using cycloheximide protein degradation assay. Our data show that the A147T mutation significantly alters the flexibility and stability of the mutant protein. Furthermore both A147T and R162H mutations decreased the half-life of the mutant proteins by about 25 percent, which could in part explain its effect on reduced pregnenolone production and susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study is the first comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of genetic variants in the TSPO gene, thereby extending the knowledge about the clinical relevance of TSPO nsSNPs.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195627</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195627</link><published>1523480400000</published><title>Effects of genetic variants in the TSPO gene on protein structure and stability</title><fingerprint>6738bd2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vladimir M.

Dynamin Guanosine Triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are best studied for their role in the terminal membrane fission process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), but they have also been proposed to regulate earlier stages of CME. Although highly enriched in neurons, dynamin-1 (Dyn1) is, in fact, widely expressed along with Dyn2 but inactivated in non-neuronal cells via phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) kinase. Here, we study the differential, isoform-specific functions of Dyn1 and Dyn2 as regulators of CME. Endogenously expressed Dyn1 and Dyn2 were fluorescently tagged either separately or together in two cell lines with contrasting Dyn1 expression levels. By quantitative live cell dual- and triple-channel total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we find that Dyn2 is more efficiently recruited to clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) than Dyn1, and that Dyn2 but not Dyn1 exhibits a pronounced burst of assembly, presumably into supramolecular collar-like structures that drive membrane scission and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. Activation of Dyn1 by acute inhibition of GSK3β results in more rapid endocytosis of transferrin receptors, increased rates of CCP initiation, and decreased CCP lifetimes but did not significantly affect the extent of Dyn1 recruitment to CCPs. Thus, activated Dyn1 can regulate early stages of CME that occur well upstream of fission, even when present at low, substoichiometric levels relative to Dyn2. Under physiological conditions, Dyn1 is activated downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to alter CCP dynamics. We identify sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) as a preferred binding partner to activated Dyn1 that is partially required for Dyn1-dependent effects on early stages of CCP maturation. Together, we decouple regulatory and scission functions of dynamins and report a scission-independent, isoform-specific regulatory role for Dyn1 in CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k6hPvNlNbzg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1524085200000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162d9ef60bd:bb316e:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Saipraveen Srinivasan, Christoph J.

The accurate identification and quality evaluation of herbal medical plants is highly necessary to ensure their safety and efficacy. In present study, a new strategy combining DNA barcoding techniques with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was proposed to facilitate the identification and quality control of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt;. In present work, the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) barcode was successfully used to identify 58 &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples and its adulterants. TLC successfully identified the other three &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples that failed to produce ITS2 regions. An adulterant was found in all the 62 samples. Moreover, the content of active medicinal ingredients is important for herbal plants quality. The content of tenacissoside H (TS-H) of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tenacissima&lt;/i&gt; samples was determined by HPLC to range from 0.39% to 1.09%, which meets the criterion of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

Autophagy plays a crucial role in health and disease, regulating central cellular processes such as adaptive stress responses, differentiation, tissue development, and homeostasis. However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-)organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti–hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-)organ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VVncDRle7Ww&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522270800000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d4:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Parodi, Jonathan A.

Together, our results demonstrate that the nucleosome context has a dramatic impact on signaling events at the histone tails, and highlights the importance of studying histone binding in the context of the nucleosome.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31481</link><published>1523491200000</published><title>The conformation of the histone H3 tail inhibits association of the BPTF PHD finger with the nucleosome</title><fingerprint>ce80d805</fingerprint><keywords><item>Genes and Chromosomes</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162b9b8bfad:d2f3df:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523534315437</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31481</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 Years Ago, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03274-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6</link><published>1521529200000</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>245c509b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50 &amp;amp;amp; 100 Years Ago, Published online: 20 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03274-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03274-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;50 &amp;amp; 100 Years Ago</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16243bba5ea:2eaad63:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1521554793962</crawled><title>50 &amp; 100 Years Ago</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01452</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Marlene Ríos-López, Jose Guillermo Mendez-Bermúdez, Hector Domínguez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01452/20180411/images/medium/jp-2018-014522_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01452&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522357200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16272f1be07:b826c:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Brian S.

Our graphs encode the directionality of metabolic fluxes via edges that represent the flow of metabolites from source to target reactions. The methodology can be applied in the absence of a specific biological context by modelling fluxes probabilistically, or can be tailored to different environmental conditions by incorporating flux distributions computed through constraint-based approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis. We illustrate our approach on the central carbon metabolism of Escherichia coli and on a metabolic model of human hepatocytes. The flux-dependent graphs under various environmental conditions and genetic perturbations exhibit systemic changes in their topological and community structure, which capture the re-routing of metabolic fluxes and the varying importance of specific reactions and pathways.

By integrating constraint-based models and tools from network science, our framework allows the study of context-specific metabolic responses at a system level beyond standard pathway descriptions.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/290767</canonicalUrl><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_16275d6ea85:77b8e51:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522395441797</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020858?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Francesco Bagattini</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020858?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 14, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020858?af=R</link><published>1523332833000</published><title>Clustering methods for the optimization of atomic cluster           structure</title><fingerprint>83dd5a58</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/14&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 14&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162c30cf7b9:1b85302:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523690829753</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25208?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25208?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25208?af=R</link><published>1522114690699</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>606b566d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_162651afe8b:6cde5:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522114690699</crawled></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195743</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Ziauddin Khan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ziauddin Khan, Suhail Ahmad, Noura Al-Sweih, Leena Joseph, Wadha Alfouzan, Mohammad Asadzadeh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging yeast pathogen of global significance. Its multidrug-resistant nature and inadequacies of conventional identification systems pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This study investigated occurrence of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in clinical specimens in Kuwait and its susceptibility to antifungal agents. Clinical yeast strains isolated during 3.5-year period and forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida were studied by wet mount examination for microscopic morphology and Vitek 2 yeast identification system. A simple species-specific PCR assay was developed for molecular identification and results were confirmed by PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Antifungal susceptibility testing of one isolate from each patient was determined by Etest. The 280 isolates forming pink-colored colonies on CHROMagar Candida, were identified by Vitek 2 as &lt;i&gt;Candida haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 166), &lt;i&gt;Candida utilis&lt;/i&gt; (n = 49), &lt;i&gt;Candida kefyr&lt;/i&gt; (n = 45), &lt;i&gt;Candida guilliermondii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 9), &lt;i&gt;Candida famata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida conglobata&lt;/i&gt; (n = 5). Species-specific PCR and PCR-sequencing of rDNA identified 166 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; isolates as &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; (n = 158), &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;haemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 6) and &lt;i&gt;Candida duobushaemulonii&lt;/i&gt; (n = 2). &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates originated from diverse clinical specimens from 56 patients. Of 56 &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested, all were resistant to fluconazole, 41/56 (73%) and 13/56 (23%) were additionally resistant to voriconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Eleven (20%) isolates were resistant to fluconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. One isolate was resistant to caspofungin and micafungin. Increasing isolation of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; in recent years from diverse clinical specimens including bloodstream shows that &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; is an emerging non-&lt;i&gt;albicans Candida&lt;/i&gt; species in Kuwait causing a variety of infections. Inability of conventional identification methods to accurately identify this pathogen and multidrug-resistant nature of many strains calls for a greater understanding of its epidemiology, risk factors for acquiring &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;auris&lt;/i&gt; infection and management strategies in high-risk patients.

Women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Evidence suggests the microclimate of the classroom is an important factor influencing female course grades and interest, which encourages retention of women in STEM fields. Here, we test whether the gender composition of small (8–9 person) learning groups impacts course performance, sense of social belonging, and intragroup peer evaluations of intellectual contributions. Across two undergraduate active learning courses in introductory biology, we manipulated the classroom microclimate by varying the gender ratios of learning groups, ranging from 0% female to 100% female. We found that as the percent of women in groups increased, so did overall course performance for all students, regardless of gender. Additionally, women assigned higher peer- evaluations in groups with more women than groups with less women. Our work demonstrates an added benefit of the retention of women in STEM: increased performance for all, and positive peer perceptions for women.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195129</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Small group gender ratios impact biology class performance and peer evaluations</title><fingerprint>bb7961bc</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lauren L.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194390</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194390</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Concordance between the original and short version of the Impulsive Behaviour Scale UPPS-P using an IRT model</title><fingerprint>88d37bb1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Óscar M.

Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78).

Previous research has linked the use of certain emotion regulation strategies to the vicarious experience of personal distress (PD) and empathic concern (EC). However, it has not yet been tested whether (1) vicarious PD is positively associated with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, (2) vicarious EC is positively associated with adaptive emotion regulation strategies or whether (3) PD and EC mediate the link between emotion regulation and reports of approach/avoidance in response to a person in distress. To that end, we assessed people’s reports of PD (i.e., anxious, troubled and upset) and EC (i.e., concerned, sympathetic and soft-hearted) in response to a video depicting a person in a threatening situation (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 78). Afterwards, we assessed participants’ reports of avoidance and approach with regard to the character and their disposition to use maladaptive and adaptive emotion regulation strategies. Results showed that both PD and EC were positively related to maladaptive strategies and negatively related to adaptive strategies, and that the association between maladaptive regulation strategies (i.e., rumination) and the willingness to avoid the person in distress was mediated by reports of greater PD. This study thus expands previous evidence on the relationship between maladaptive regulation strategies and affective empathy and provides novel insights into the main role that PD plays in the association between maladaptive strategies and social avoidance.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194248</canonicalUrl><updated>1521666000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087e0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24183-8</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Dominik Brado</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24183-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/aujIk8xiaW8/s41598-018-24183-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24183-8</link><published>1523862000000</published><title>Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa</title><fingerprint>5ab1a39f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24183-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24183-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/aujIk8xiaW8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162cda398f0:2886fff:9f3b30f2</id><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24183-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24183-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Analyses of HIV-1 integrase sequences prior to South African national HIV-treatment program and availability of integrase inhibitors in Cape Town, South Africa&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/aujIk8xiaW8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1523868473584</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6384/9?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Maxon, M.

Whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) affects mental functions, and how any such effects arise from its neural effects, continue to be debated. We investigated whether tDCS applied over the visual cortex (Oz) with a vertex (Cz) reference might affect response times (RTs) in a visual search task. We also examined whether any significant tDCS effects would interact with task factors (target presence, discrimination difficulty, and stimulus brightness) that are known to selectively influence one or the other of the two information processing stages posited by current models of visual search. Based on additive factor logic, we expected that the pattern of interactions involving a significant tDCS effect could help us colocalize the tDCS effect to one (or both) of the processing stages. In Experiment 1 (n = 12), anodal tDCS improved RTs significantly; cathodal tDCS produced a nonsignificant trend toward improvement. However, there were no interactions between the anodal tDCS effect and target presence or discrimination difficulty. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we manipulated stimulus brightness along with target presence and discrimination difficulty. Anodal and cathodal tDCS both produced significant improvements in RTs. Again, the tDCS effects did not interact with any of the task factors. In Experiment 3 (n = 16), electrodes were placed at Cz and on the upper arm, to test for a possible effect of incidental stimulation of the motor regions under Cz. No effect of tDCS on RTs was found. These findings strengthen the case for tDCS having real effects on cerebral information processing. However, these effects did not clearly arise from either of the two processing stages of the visual search process. We suggest that this is because tDCS has a DIFFUSE, pervasive action across the task-relevant neuroanatomical region(s), not a discrete effect in terms of information processing stages.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194640</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194640</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) facilitates overall visual search response times but does not interact with visual search task factors</title><fingerprint>ccb4010c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kyongje Sung, Barry Gordon&lt;/p&gt;

Biosecurity is defined as the implementation of measures that reduce the risk of disease agents being introduced and/or spread. For pig production, several of these measures are routinely implemented (e.g. cleaning, disinfection, segregation). However, air as a potential vector of pathogens has long been disregarded. Filters for incoming and recirculating air were installed into an already existing ventilation plant at a fattening piggery (3,840 pigs at maximum) in Saxony, Germany. Over a period of three consecutive fattening periods, we evaluated various parameters including air quality indices, environmental and operating parameters, and pig performance. Animal data regarding respiratory diseases, presence of antibodies against influenza A viruses, PRRSV, and &lt;i&gt;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; and lung health score at slaughter were recorded, additionally. There were no significant differences (p = 0.824) in total bacterial counts between barns with and without air filtration. Recirculating air filtration resulted in the lowest total dust concentration (0.12 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and lung health was best in animals from the barn equipped with recirculating air filtration modules. However, there was no difference in animal performance. Antibodies against all above mentioned pathogens were detected but mostly animals were already antibody-positive at re-stocking. We demonstrated that supply air filtration as well as recirculating air filtration technique can easily be implemented in an already existing ventilation system and that recirculating air filtration resulted in enhanced lung health compared to supply air-filtered and non-filtered barns. A more prominent effect might have been obtained in a breeding facility because of the longer life span of sows and a higher biosecurity level with air filtration as an add-on measure.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194641</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194641</link><published>1521579600000</published><title>Impact of different supply air and recirculating air filtration systems on stable climate, animal health, and performance of fattening pigs in a commercial pig farm</title><fingerprint>96acc23b</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cindy Wenke, Janina Pospiech, Tobias Reutter, Bettina Altmann, Uwe Truyen, Stephanie Speck&lt;/p&gt;

It is known that each tissue exhibits differential gene expression patterns and enzymatic activities. Therefore, transcriptomic data are commonly used to tailor GEMs and capture tissue-specific behavior. However, since measured gene expression levels span several orders of magnitude, and many reactions in GEMs involve multiple genes, decisions must be made on how to overlay the data onto the network. Referred to here as &apos;preprocessing&apos;, as it addresses the steps prior to context-specific model construction, these decisions include how to map gene expression levels to the gene-protein-reaction rules (i.e. gene mapping), the selection of thresholds on expression data to consider the associated gene as &apos;active&apos; (i.e. thresholding), and the order in which these gene mapping and thresholding are imposed. Each of these decisions could impact the resulting expression values associated with each reaction, and therefore model construction and biological interpretation. However, the influence of these decisions has not been systematically tested, nor is it clear which combination of preprocessing decisions will capture the most appropriate biological description of the available data. To this end, we compared 20 different combinations of existing preprocessing decisions, each of which were imposed on transcriptomic dataset across 32 tissues. Our analysis suggested that the thresholding approach has the greatest influence on the definition of which reaction may be considered as active. Finally, we compared tissue-specific active reaction lists based on their capacity to recapitulate groups of tissues at the organ-system level and through this identified optimal preprocessing decisions.

The IL-1 cytokine family includes eleven members, among which Il-36α, β and γ, IL-36Ra and IL-38. The IL-36 cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. IL-38 is also expressed in the skin and was previously proposed to act as an IL-36 antagonist. In this study, we thus examined expression and function of Il-38 in a mouse model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA was detected in the epidermis and in primary mouse keratinocytes, but not in dermal fibroblasts. At the peak of IMQ-induced inflammation, skin &lt;i&gt;Il-38&lt;/i&gt; mRNA levels were reduced, whereas &lt;i&gt;Il-36ra&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression increased. The severity of IMQ-induced skin inflammation, as assessed by recording ear thickness and histological changes, was similar in Il-38 KO and WT littermate control mice, while, in contrast, Il-36ra-deficient mice displayed more severe skin pathology than their WT littermates. Il-38-deficiency had no impact on IMQ-induced expression of proinflammatory mediators in the skin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, on the basal expression of various cytokines or chemokines by cultured primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, or on the response of these cells to Il-36β. Finally, after cessation of topical IMQ application, the resolution of skin inflammation was also not altered in Il-38 KO mice. In conclusion, Il-38-deficiency did not impact the development or resolution of IMQ-induced skin inflammation. Our observations further suggest that endogenous Il-38 does not exert Il-36 inhibitory activity in this model, or in cultured skin cells. A potential anti-inflammatory function of Il-38 in mouse skin thus still remains to be demonstrated.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194667</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194667</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>The severity of imiquimod-induced mouse skin inflammation is independent of endogenous IL-38 expression</title><fingerprint>4d0ec072</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Palomo, Sabina Troccaz, Dominique Talabot-Ayer, Emiliana Rodriguez, Gaby Palmer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; urogenital serovars primarily replicate in epithelial cells lining the reproductive tract. Epithelial cells recognize &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; through cell surface and cytosolic receptors, and/or endosomal innate receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of these receptors triggers both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that are required for chlamydial clearance, but are also responsible for the immunopathology in the reproductive tract. We previously demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;) induces IFN-β in oviduct epithelial cells (OE) in a TLR3-dependent manner, and that the synthesis of several cytokines and chemokines are diminished in &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-challenged OE derived from TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; 129S1 mice. Furthermore, our &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; replication in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; OE is more efficient than in wild-type OE. Because TLR3 modulates the release inflammatory mediators involved in host defense during &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; infection, we hypothesized that TLR3 plays a protective role against &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt;-induced genital tract pathology in congenic C57BL/6N mice. Using the &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; mouse model for human &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia&lt;/i&gt; genital tract infections, we demonstrated that TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice had increased &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; shedding during early and mid-stage genital infection. In early stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed a diminished synthesis of IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-6, but enhanced production of IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In mid-stage infection, TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significantly enhanced lymphocytic endometritis and salpingitis than wild-type mice. These lymphocytes were predominantly scattered along the endometrial stroma and the associated smooth muscle, and the lamina propria supporting the oviducts. Surprisingly, our data show that CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cells are significantly enhanced in the genital tract TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice during mid-stage &lt;i&gt;Chlamydial&lt;/i&gt; infection. In late-stage infections, both mouse strains developed hydrosalpinx; however, the extent of hydrosalpinx was more severe in TLR3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these data suggest that TLR3 promotes the clearance of &lt;i&gt;Cm&lt;/i&gt; during early and mid-stages of genital tract infection, and that loss of TLR3 is detrimental in the development hydrosalpinx.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195165</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195165</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) promotes the resolution of &amp;lt;i&gt;Chlamydia muridarum&amp;lt;/i&gt; genital tract infection in congenic C57BL/6N mice</title><fingerprint>a75a15bf</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are sparse on the range of BMI among patients acutely admitted to general hospitals. We investigated BMI values and associated patient characteristics, reasons for hospital admission, and mortality in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We identified all persons with an acute inpatient admission 2011–2014 in Central Denmark Region and assessed BMI measurements recorded in the Clinical Information System. We used cross-sectional and cohort analyses to examine the BMI distribution and its association with demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, tobacco smoking, reasons for admission, and 30-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 92,027 acutely admitted patients (median age 62 years, 49% female) with a BMI measurement, 4% had a BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;lt;18.5, 42% a BMI between 18.5 and 25, 34% a BMI between 25 and 30, and 20% a BMI ≥30. Compared with normal-weight patients, 30-day mortality was high among patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 (7.5% vs. 2.8%, age- and smoking-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0–2.9, whereas patients with overweight (aOR 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8) and obesity class I (aOR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9)). Compared with the total population, patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 were older (68 years median); more were female (73%); more had comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score &gt;0 in 42% vs. 33% overall), more were current smokers (45% vs. 27% overall), and acute admissions due to respiratory diseases or femoral fractures were frequent. In contrast, patients with BMI ≥30 were relatively young (59 years median), fewer smoked (24%): type 2 diabetes, sleep disorders, cholelithiasis, and heart failure were frequent diagnoses. Prevalence of therapies for metabolic syndrome, pain, and psychiatric disorders increased with higher BMI, while patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 frequently used asthma medications, glucocorticoids, and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In patients acutely admitted to general hospitals, reasons for hospital admission and associated clinical characteristics differ substantially according to BMI range. BMI &amp;lt;18.5 is a clinical predictor of high short-term mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</link><published>1523912400000</published><title>Body Mass Index of 92,027 patients acutely admitted to general hospitals in Denmark: Associated clinical characteristics and 30-day mortality</title><fingerprint>8097dd7e</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sigrid Bjerge Gribsholt, Lars Pedersen, Bjørn Richelsen, Olaf Dekkers, Reimar Wernich Thomsen&lt;/p&gt;

We used cross-sectional and cohort analyses to examine the BMI distribution and its association with demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, tobacco smoking, reasons for admission, and 30-day mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 92,027 acutely admitted patients (median age 62 years, 49% female) with a BMI measurement, 4% had a BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &amp;lt;18.5, 42% a BMI between 18.5 and 25, 34% a BMI between 25 and 30, and 20% a BMI ≥30. Compared with normal-weight patients, 30-day mortality was high among patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 (7.5% vs. 2.8%, age- and smoking-adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0–2.9, whereas patients with overweight (aOR 0.7; 95% CI: 0.6–0.8) and obesity class I (aOR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6–0.9)). Compared with the total population, patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 were older (68 years median); more were female (73%); more had comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index score &gt;0 in 42% vs. 33% overall), more were current smokers (45% vs. 27% overall), and acute admissions due to respiratory diseases or femoral fractures were frequent. In contrast, patients with BMI ≥30 were relatively young (59 years median), fewer smoked (24%): type 2 diabetes, sleep disorders, cholelithiasis, and heart failure were frequent diagnoses. Prevalence of therapies for metabolic syndrome, pain, and psychiatric disorders increased with higher BMI, while patients with BMI &amp;lt;18.5 frequently used asthma medications, glucocorticoids, and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In patients acutely admitted to general hospitals, reasons for hospital admission and associated clinical characteristics differ substantially according to BMI range. BMI &amp;lt;18.5 is a clinical predictor of high short-term mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195853</canonicalUrl><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162cf89f31e:2bf7ae7:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523900347166</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Ivan Wen Wen Lau</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;Current diagnostic assessment tools remain suboptimal in demonstrating complex morphology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This limitation has posed several challenges in preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education. This study aims to investigate the dimensional accuracy and the clinical value of 3D printed model of CHD in the above three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) data, a patient-specific 3D model of a 20-month-old boy with double outlet right ventricle was printed in Tango Plus material. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlation of the quantitative measurements taken at analogous anatomical locations between the CCTA images pre- and post-3D printing. Qualitative analysis was conducted by distributing surveys to six health professionals (two radiologists, two cardiologists and two cardiac surgeons) and three medical academics to assess the clinical value of the 3D printed model in these three areas.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Excellent correlation (r = 0.99) was noted in the measurements between CCTA and 3D printed model, with a mean difference of 0.23 mm. Four out of six health professionals found the model to be useful in facilitating preoperative planning, while all of them thought that the model would be invaluable in enhancing patient-doctor communication. All three medical academics found the model to be helpful in teaching, and thought that the students will be able to learn the pathology quicker with better understanding.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The complex cardiac anatomy can be accurately replicated in flexible material using 3D printing technology. 3D printed heart models could serve as an excellent tool in facilitating preoperative planning, communication in medical practice, and medical education, although further studies with inclusion of more clinical cases are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194333</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Clinical value of patient-specific three-dimensional printing of congenital heart disease: Quantitative and qualitative assessments</title><fingerprint>2e27b850</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Wen Wen Lau, Dongting Liu, Lei Xu, Zhanming Fan, Zhonghua Sun&lt;/p&gt;

Frailty is a risk factor for disability and mortality, and is more prevalent among African American (AA) elderly than whites. We examine frailty in middle-aged racially and economically diverse adults, and investigate how race, poverty and frailty are associated with mortality. Data were from 2541 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study in Baltimore, Maryland; 35–64 years old at initial assessment (56% women; 58% AA). Frailty was assessed using a modified FRAIL scale of fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness and weight loss, and compared with difficulties in physical functioning and daily activities. Frailty prevalence was calculated across race and age groups, and associations with survival were assessed by Cox Regression. 278 participants were frail (11%); 924 pre-frail (36%); 1339 not frail (53%). For those aged 45–54, a higher proportion of whites (13%) than AAs (8%) were frail; while the proportions were similar for those 55–64 (14%,16%). Frailty was associated with overall survival with an average follow-up of 6.6 years, independent of race, sex and poverty status (HR = 2.30; 95%CI 1.67–3.18). In this sample of economically and racially diverse older adults, the known association of frailty prevalence and age differed across race with whites having higher prevalence at younger ages. Frailty was associated with survival beyond the risk factors of race and poverty status in this middle-aged group. Early recognition of frailty at these younger ages may provide an effective method for preventing or delaying disabilities.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195637</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Frailty in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of middle-aged Americans in Baltimore</title><fingerprint>743ddfcb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felicia R.

Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an increasing public health concern because of rapid lifestyle changes. Although there have been previous studies on the prevalence of MS in China, the prevalence may have changed with lifestyle changes over the last decade. To update this prevalence, we performed a cross-sectional survey among adults over 18 years old across China from May 2013 to July 2014. Participants underwent questionnaires and provided blood and urine samples for analysis. MS was defined according to the criteria of the China Diabetes Society. A total of 12570 individuals (45.2% men) with an average age of 48.8±15.3 (18–96) years were selected and invited to participate in the study. In total, 9310 (40.7% men) individuals completed the investigation, with a response rate of 74.1%. The prevalence of MS in China was 14.39% [95% confidence interval (CI): -3.75–32.53%], and the age-adjusted prevalence was 9.82% (95% CI: 9.03–10.61%; 7.78% in men and 6.76% in women; 7.39% in rural residents and 6.98% in urban residents). The highest prevalence occurred among adults aged 50–59 years (1.95%, 95% CI: 1.40–2.50%), and the lowest prevalence occurred among adults aged 40–49 years (0.74%, 95% CI: 0.38–1.10%); the prevalence was the highest in the south region and lowest in the east region (4.46% and 1.23%, respectively). The results of logistic regression analyses showed that age, urolithiasis, hyperuricemia, coronary artery disease, thiazide drugs intake, family history of diabetes and hypertension were all significantly associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (OR&gt;1). In addition, education, vitamin D intake and family history of urolithiasis are all protective factors (OR&amp;lt;1). Our results indicate that there was a high prevalence of MS in Chinese adults. Compared to the previous study 10 years ago, some preventive strategies have worked; however, further work on the prevention and treatment of MS remains necessary.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196012</link><published>1524085200000</published><title>Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in China: An up-dated cross-sectional study</title><fingerprint>b664fda7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Lan, Zanlin Mai, Shiyu Zhou, Yang Liu, Shujue Li, Zhijian Zhao, Xiaolu Duan, Cao Cai, Tuo Deng, Wei Zhu, Wenqi Wu, Guohua Zeng&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, Chick et al., 2015 and Yu et al., 2016 proposed the spectrum-based and tag-based open search methods, respectively, to identify peptides with PTMs. While the performance of these two methods is promising, the identification results vary greatly with respect to the quality of tandem mass spectra and the number of PTMs in peptides.

Skeletal muscle (SM) health and integrity is dependent on the dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, and central to this process is the availability of amino acids (AA) in the amino pool. While Doxorubicin (DOX) remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies, little is known of the effect of the drug on SM, particularly its effect on the availability of amino acids in the tissue. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of DOX administration on vascular, interstitial and intracellular concentrations of AA in SM of the rat up to 8 days after the administration of a 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg i.p. dose of DOX. In the plasma, total amino acids (TAA) were significantly increased compared to control where greater (P&amp;lt;0.05) concentrations were observed following the 1.5 mg/kg dose compared to the 4.5 mg/kg dose. Compared to control, the 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in an increase (P&amp;lt;0.05) in interstitial TAA whereas the 4.5 mg/kg resulted in a sustained decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05). Intracellular TAA, essential amino acids (EAA) and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) where significantly increased in each muscle group analyzed, following the 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg doses compared to control. This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>Doxorubicin chemotherapy affects the intracellular and interstitial free amino acid pools in skeletal muscle</title><fingerprint>bc1ca964</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sergio Fabris, David A.

This study provides important insight into the amino acid response following DOX chemotherapy and presents a substantial foundation for future studies focused on reducing SM damage and recovery by targeting amino acid metabolism.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195330</canonicalUrl><updated>1522875600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fa:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Jerzy Cioslowski</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023281?af=R</link><published>1522988918000</published><title>Solitonic natural orbitals</title><fingerprint>4b1147ec</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b67:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03525-0</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Cyril Corbet</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interruption of lactate uptake by inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate transport unravels direct antitumor and radiosensitizing effects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interruption of lactate uptake by inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate transport unravels direct antitumor and radiosensitizing effects, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03525-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03525-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Tumor cells can fuel their metabolism with lactate.

Competitive pressure to maximize the current bibliometric measures of productivity is jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific literature. Efforts are underway to address the ‘reproducibility crisis’ by encouraging the use of more rigorous, confirmatory methods. However, as long as productivity continues to be defined by the number of discoveries scientists publish, the impact factor of the journals they publish in and the number of times their papers are cited, they will be reluctant to accept high quality methods and consistently conduct and publish confirmatory/replication studies. This exploratory study examined a sample of rigorous Phase II-IV clinical trials, including unpublished studies, to determine if more appropriate metrics and incentives can be developed. The results suggest that rigorous procedures will help reduce false positives, but to the extent that higher quality methods are accepted as the standard of practice, the current bibliometric incentives will discourage innovative studies and encourage scientists to shift their research to less informative studies of subjects that are already being more actively investigated. However, the results also suggest that it is possible to develop a more appropriate system of rewards. In contrast to the current bibliometric incentives, evaluations of the quality of the methods and reproducibility of the results, innovation and diversity of thought, and amount of information produced may serve as measures and incentives that maintain the integrity of the scientific literature and maximize scientific progress.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195321</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195321</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Scientific productivity: An exploratory study of metrics and incentives</title><fingerprint>c68ecb99</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mark D.

Background &lt;p&gt;Middle ear disease (otitis media) is endemic among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia and represents an important cause of hearing loss. The disease is the result of a mix of biological, environmental and host risk factors that interact in complex, non-linear ways along a dynamic continuum. As such, it is generally recognised that a holistic, systems approach is required to reverse the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The objective of this paper is to examine the alignment between efforts designed to address otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Queensland, Australia and core concepts of systems thinking. This paper’s overall purpose is to identify which combination of activities, and at which level, hold the potential to facilitate systems changes to better support ear health among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We began with a review of documents identified in consultation with stakeholders and an online search. In addition, key informants were invited to participate in an online survey and a face-to-face or phone interview. Qualitative interviews using a semi-structured interview guide were used to explore survey responses in more depth. We also undertook interviews at the community level to elicit a diverse range of views. Ideas, statements or activities reported in the documents and interviews as being performed under the Intervention Level Framework were identified using qualitative thematic and content analysis. A quantitative descriptive analysis was also undertaken, whereby data was extracted into an Excel spreadsheet and coded under the relevant strategic directions and performance indicators of the Framework. Subsequently, we coded activities against the five-level intervention framework developed by Malhi and colleagues, that is: 1) paradigm; 2) goals; 3) system structure; 4) feedback and delays; and 5) structural elements.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, twenty documents were reviewed. We examined surveys and interviews with six key informants. Twenty-four individual and 3 group interviews were conducted across central and community level informants. One hundred and four items were coded from the 20 documents and 156 items from interview data. For both data sets, the majority of activities were coded at the structural elements level. The results suggested three key areas where further work is needed to drive sustained improvements: 1) build the governance structures needed for paradigm shift to achieve a multi-sectoral approach; 2) develop shared system level goals; 3) develop system-wide feedback processes.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sustained progress in improving ear health within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children requires a holistic, system-wide approach. To advance such work, governance structures for multi-sectoral collaboration including the development of joint goals and monitoring and feedback are required. Intervening at these higher leverage points could have a profound effect on persistent public health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194275</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194275</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>Using systems thinking and the Intervention Level Framework to analyse public health planning for complex problems: Otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children</title><fingerprint>ea9b2d45</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jo Durham, Lisa Schubert, Lisa Vaughan, Cameron D.

Identifying microbial genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis. We approach this problem by measuring the statistical association between having a species having a gene and the probability that the species is present in the gut microbiome. The challenge is that closely related species tend to be jointly present or absent in the microbiome and also share many genes, only a subset of which are involved in gut adaptation. We show that this phylogenetic correlation indeed leads to many false discoveries and propose phylogenetic linear regression as a powerful solution. To apply this method across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we use metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species&apos; prevalence in and specificity for the gut microbiome. This analysis reveals thousands of genes potentially involved in adaptation to the gut across species, including many novel candidates as well as processes known to contribute to fitness of gut bacteria, such as acid tolerance in Bacteroidetes and sporulation in Firmicutes. We also find microbial genes associated with a preference for the gut over other body sites, which are significantly enriched for genes linked to fitness in an in vivo competition experiment. Finally, we identify gene families associated with higher prevalence in patients with Crohn&apos;s disease, including Proteobacterial genes involved in conjugation and fimbria regulation, processes previously linked to inflammation.

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacteria are able to grow in a planktonic state that is associated with acute infections and in biofilms that are associated with chronic infections. Acute infections, such as skin infections, are often self-limiting. However, chronic infections, such as implant infections, can be difficult to clear and may require surgical intervention. The host immune response may contribute to the different outcomes often associated with these two disease types. We used proteomic arrays and two murine models for an initial, descriptive characterization of the contribution of the host immune response to outcomes of acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; disease. We compared the immune responses between a model of self-limiting skin and soft tissue infection caused by the planktonic form of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; versus a model of surgical mesh implant infection, which we show to be caused by a bacterial biofilm. The significantly altered host cytokines and chemokines were largely different in the two models, with responses diminished by 21 days post-implantation in surgical mesh infection. Because bacterial levels remained constant during the 21 days that the surgical mesh infection was followed, those cytokines that are significantly increased during chronic infection are not likely effective in eradicating biofilm. Comparison of the levels of cytokines and chemokines in acute versus chronic &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection can provide a starting point for evaluation of the role of specific immune factors that are present in one disease manifestation but not the other.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195342</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Comparison of the immune response during acute and chronic &amp;lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;lt;/i&gt; infection</title><fingerprint>c9c56a66</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca A.

CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome, giving rise to distinct subsets such as individual CREs and Clusters Of cis-Regulatory Elements (COREs), also known as super-enhancers. Identifying COREs is a challenge due to technical and biological features that entail variability in the distribution of distances between CREs within a given dataset. To address this issue, we developed a new unsupervised machine learning approach termed Clustering of genomic REgions Analysis Method (CREAM) that outperforms the Ranking Of Super Enhancer (ROSE) approach. Specifically CREAM identified COREs are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription factors according to ChIP-seq signal intensity, are proximal to highly expressed genes, are preferentially found near genes essential for cell growth and are more predictive of cell identity. Moreover, we show that CREAM enables subtyping primary prostate tumor samples according to their CORE distribution across the genome. We further show that COREs are enriched compared to individual CREs at TAD boundaries and these are preferentially bound by CTCF and factors of the cohesin complex (e.g.: RAD21 and SMC3). Finally, using CREAM against transcription factor ChIP-seq reveals CTCF and cohesin-specific COREs preferentially at TAD boundaries compared to intra-TADs.

CREAM is available as an open source R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CREAM) to identify COREs from cis-regulatory annotation datasets from any biological samples.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/20/222562</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162456b22c7:31b22c4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521583071943</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/3186.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Song Qi, Demis Hassabis, Jiayin Sun, Fangjian Guo, Nathaniel Daw, Dean Mobbs</name></author><description>Flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which an organism flees from an approaching threat, is an ecological metric of cost–benefit functions of escape decisions.

Using interolog and domain-based approaches, we constructed an inter-species protein interactome with 5115 protein-protein interactions between 2291 Glycine max and 290 Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110 proteins. The interactome was validated by expression pattern analysis in nodules, GO term semantic similarity, and co-expression analysis. One sub-network was further confirmed using luciferase complementation image assay. In the G. max-B. diazoefficiens interactome, bacterial proteins are mainly ion channel and transporters of carbohydrates and cations, while G. max proteins are mainly involved in the processes of metabolism, signal transduction, and transport. We also identified the top ten highly interacting proteins (hubs) for each of the two species. KEGG pathway analysis for each hub showed that two 14-3-3 proteins (SGF14g and SGF14k) and five heat shock proteins in G. max are possibly involved in symbiosis, and ten hubs in B. diazoefficiens may be important symbiotic effectors. Subnetwork analysis showed that 18 symbiosis-related SNARE proteins may play roles in regulating bacterial ion channels, and SGF14g and SGF14k possibly regulate the rhizobium dicarboxylate transport protein DctA. The predicted interactome and symbiosis proteins provide a valuable basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of root nodule symbiosis in soybean.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288811v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/288811v1?rss=1</link><published>1522134000000</published><title>Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 110-Glycine max interactome provides candidate proteins associated with symbiosis [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>bb018da2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Although the legume-rhizobium symbiosis is a most important biological process, there is a limited knowledge about the protein interaction network between host and symbiont.

Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on genetic connectivity among populations remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and in the management and conservation of species. North Pacific hake (&lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&lt;/i&gt;) inhabits upwelling regions in the California Current ecosystem from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this study, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite variation to estimate levels of genetic differentiation of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;productus&lt;/i&gt; in relation to the role of oceanographic features as potential barriers to gene flow. Samples were obtained from nine sites spanning a large part of the geographic range of the species, from Puget Sound, Washington to Costa Rica. The microsatellite results revealed three genetically discrete populations: one spanning the eastern Pacific coast, and two apparently resident populations circumscribed to the Puget Sound and the northern Gulf of California (F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.032, p = 0.036). Cytochrome b sequence data indicated that isolation between the Puget Sound and northern Gulf of California populations from the coastal Pacific were recent phenomena (18.5 kyr for Puget Sound and 40 kyr for the northern Gulf of California). Oceanographic data obtained from the Gulf of California support the hypothesis that permanent fronts within the region, and strong gradients at the entrance to the Gulf of California act as barriers to gene flow. A seascape genetics approach found significant genetic–environment associations, where the daytime sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were the best predictive variables for the observed genetic differentiation. Considering the potential causes of genetic isolation among the three populations, e.g. spawning areas in different latitudes associated with upwelling processes, oceanographic barriers, asymmetric migration and specialized diet, oceanographic barriers appear to be a likely mechanism restricting gene flow.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194646</link><published>1522098000000</published><title>Role of oceanography in shaping the genetic structure in the North Pacific hake &amp;lt;i&gt;Merluccius productus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><fingerprint>aef9a238</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francisco Javier García-De León, Carolina Galván-Tirado, Laura Sánchez Velasco, Claudia A.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</link><published>1523307600000</published><title>Approximating net interactions among rigid domains</title><fingerprint>7fa8e306</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</canonicalUrl><updated>1523307600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529d:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2676.short?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><author><name>Nicolas Pavillon, Alison J.

In this paper we explored the effects of exposure to images of the suffering and vulnerability of others on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated incentivized economic decisions, accounting for differences in participants’ dispositional empathy and reported in-group trust for their recipient(s). This was done using a pictorial priming task, framed as a memory test, and a triadic economic game design. Using the largest experimental sample to date to explore this issue, our integrated analysis of two online experiments (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 519), found statistically consistent evidence that exposure to images of suffering and vulnerability (vs. neutral images) increased altruistic in-group giving as measured by the “triple dictator game”, and that the manipulation was significantly more effective in those who reported lower trust for their recipients. The experimental manipulation also significantly increased altruistic giving in the standard “dictator game” and trust-based giving in the “investment game”, but only in those who were lower in in-group trust and also high in affective or cognitive empathy. Complementary qualitative evidence revealed the strongest motivations associated with increased giving in the experimental condition were greater assumed reciprocation and a lower aversion to risk. However, no consistent effects of the experimental manipulation on participants’ reciprocated decisions were observed. These findings suggest that, as well as altruistic decision-making in the “triple dictator game”, collaboratively witnessing the suffering of others may heighten trust-based in-group giving in the “investment game” for some people, but the effects are heterogeneous and sensitive to context.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194569</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194569</link><published>1521666000000</published><title>The effects of exposure to images of others&apos; suffering and vulnerability on altruistic, trust-based, and reciprocated economic decision-making</title><fingerprint>543cc4d1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Philip A.

An epidemiological model is presented that provides a comprehensive description of the transmission pathways involved for recurrent tuberculosis (TB), whereby cured individuals can become reinfected. Our main goal is to determine conditions that lead to the appearance of a backward bifurcation. This occurs when an asymptotically stable infection free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable non-trivial equilibria even though the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is less than unity. Although, some 10-30% cases of TB are recurrent, the role of recurrent TB as far as the formation of backward bifurcation is concerned, is rarely if ever studied. The model used here incorporates progressive primary infection, exogenous reinfection, endogenous reactivation and recurrent TB as transmission mechanisms that contribute to TB progression. Unlike other studies of TB dynamics that make use of frequency dependent transmission rates, our analysis provides exact backward bifurcation threshold conditions without resorting to commonly applied approximations and simplifying assumptions. Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation. Furthermore, recurrent TB can independently induce backward bifurcation phenomena if it exceeds a certain threshold.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194256</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194256</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Backward bifurcation and hysteresis in models of recurrent tuberculosis</title><fingerprint>ec1cd0e8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Isaac Mwangi Wangari, Lewi Stone&lt;/p&gt;

Exploration of the model through analytical and numerical analysis reveal that recurrent TB is sometimes capable of triggering hysteresis effects which allow TB to persist when &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 1 even though there is no backward bifurcation. Furthermore, recurrent TB can independently induce backward bifurcation phenomena if it exceeds a certain threshold.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194256</canonicalUrl><updated>1521752400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123917:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193376</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Christine A.

Household air pollution from burning solid fuels is responsible for an estimated 2.9 million premature deaths worldwide each year and 4.5% of global disability-adjusted life years, while cooking and fuel collection pose a considerable time burden, particularly for women and children. Cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves have the potential to lower exposure to household air pollution as well as reduce fuelwood demand by increasing the combustion efficiency of cooking fires, which may in turn yield ancillary benefits in other domains. The present paper capitalises on opportunities offered by the Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest randomised trial of biomass-fuelled cookstoves on health outcomes conducted to date, the design of which allows for the evaluation of additional outcomes at scale. This mixed methods study assesses the impact of cookstoves on primary school absenteeism in Karonga district, northern Malawi, in particular by conferring health and time and resource gains on young people aged 5–18. The analysis combines quantitative data from 6168 primary school students with in-depth interviews and focus group discussions carried out among 48 students in the same catchment area in 2016. Negative binomial regression models find no evidence that the cookstoves affected primary school absenteeism overall [IRR 0.92 (0.71–1.18), p = 0.51]. Qualitative analysis suggests that the cookstoves did not sufficiently improve household health to influence school attendance, while the time and resource burdens associated with cooking activities—although reduced in intervention households—were considered to be compatible with school attendance in both trial arms. More research is needed to assess whether the cookstoves influenced educational outcomes not captured by the attendance measure available, such as timely arrival to school or hours spent on homework.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193376</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193376</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>From kitchen to classroom: Assessing the impact of cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves on primary school attendance in Karonga district, northern Malawi</title><fingerprint>78aec8a7</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christine A.

The aim of this paper is to encourage research about internal diversity metrics.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/30/292177</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16277834981:7b7fe78:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522423515521</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03816-y</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cells that bestow those curly locks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells that bestow those curly locks, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03816-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03816-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sheep show that it takes two types of cells to create a curl.</description><engagement>2</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03816-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03816-y</link><published>1521702000000</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>64735be3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The cells that bestow those curly locks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells that bestow those curly locks, Published online: 22 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03816-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03816-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Sheep show that it takes two types of cells to create a curl.</content></content><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1624ff4cf9e:41e61db:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03816-y/d41586-018-03816-y_15555788.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width><height>576</height></visual><crawled>1521759866782</crawled><title>The cells that bestow those curly locks</title></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Statistical_Force-Field_for_Structural_Modeling_Using_Chemical_Cross-Linking_mass_Spectrometry_Distance_Constraints/6030563</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Chemical cross-linking/Mass Spectrometry (XLMS) is an experimental method to obtain distance constraints between amino acid residues, which can be applied to structural modeling of tertiary and quaternary biomolecular structures.

Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</link><published>1523048400000</published><title>Diel hysteresis between soil respiration and soil temperature in a biological soil crust covered desert ecosystem</title><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The general question by what mechanism an “effector” molecule and the hemes of hemoglobin interact over widely separated intramolecular distances to change the oxygen affinity has been extensively investigated, and still has remained of central interest. In the present work we were interested in clarifying the general role of the protein matrix and its dynamics in the regulation of human adult hemoglobin (HbA). We used a spectroscopy approach that yields the compressibility (&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;) of the protein matrix around the hemes of the subunits in HbA and studied how the binding of heterotropic allosteric effectors modify this parameter. &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; is directly related to the variance of volume fluctuation, therefore it characterizes the molecular dynamics of the protein structure. For the experiments the heme groups either in the α or in the β subunits of HbA were replaced by fluorescent Zn-protoporphyrinIX, and series of fluorescence line narrowed spectra were measured at varied pressures. The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194994</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194994</link><published>1522184400000</published><title>Dissimilar flexibility of α and β subunits of human adult hemoglobin influences the protein dynamics and its alteration induced by allosteric effectors</title><fingerprint>2b113486</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gusztáv Schay, András D.

The evaluation of the spectra yielded the compressibility that showed significant dynamic asymmetry between the subunits: &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunit was 0.17±0.05/GPa, while for the β subunit it was much higher, 0.36±0.07/GPa. The heterotropic effectors, chloride ions, inositol hexaphosphate and bezafibrate did not cause significant changes in &lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt; of the α subunits, while in the β subunits the effectors lead to a significant reduction down to 0.15±0.04/GPa. We relate our results to structural data, to results of recent functional studies and to those of molecular dynamics simulations, and find good agreements. The observed asymmetry in the flexibility suggests a distinct role of the subunits in the regulation of Hb that results in the observed changes of the oxygen binding capability.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194994</canonicalUrl><updated>1522184400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1d:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00717</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Xiaozheng Zhang, Fengchao Cui, Hongqian Chen, Tianshu Zhang, Kecheng Yang, Yibo Wang, Zhenyan Jiang, Kenner C.

The poorly understood mechanisms of dry season persistence of &lt;i&gt;Anopheles&lt;/i&gt; spp. mosquitoes through the dry season in Africa remain a critical gap in our knowledge of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; disease transmission. While it is thought that adult mosquitoes remain in a dormant state throughout this seven-month dry season, the nature of this state remains unknown and has largely not been recapitulated in laboratory settings. To elucidate possible connections of this state with microbial composition, the whole body microbiomes of adult mosquitoes in the dry and wet seasons in two locations of Mali with varying water availability were compared by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. These locations were a village near the Niger River with year-round water sources (N’Gabakoro, “riparian”), and a typical Sahelian area with highly seasonal breeding sites (Thierola Area, “Sahelian”). The 16S bacterial data consisted of 2057 sequence variants in 426 genera across 184 families. From these data, we found several compositional differences that were seasonally and spatially linked. Counter to our initial hypothesis, there were more pronounced seasonal differences in the bacterial microbiome of riparian, rather than Sahelian areas. These seasonal shifts were primarily in &lt;i&gt;Ralstonia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sphingorhabdus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Duganella&lt;/i&gt; spp. bacteria that are usually soil and water-associated, indicating these changes may be from bacteria acquired in the larval environment, rather than adulthood. In Sahelian dry season mosquitoes, there was a unique intracellular bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Anaplasma&lt;/i&gt;, which likely was acquired through non-human blood feeding. Cytochrome B analysis of blood meals showed greater heterogeneity in host choice of &lt;i&gt;An&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coluzzii&lt;/i&gt; independent of season in the Thierola area compared to N’Gabakoro (77.5% vs. 94.6% human-origin blood meal, respectively), indicating a relaxation of anthropophily. Overall, this exploratory study provides valuable indications of spatial and seasonal differences in bacterial composition which help refine this difficult to study state.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194899</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194899</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Investigation of the seasonal microbiome of &amp;lt;i&gt;Anopheles coluzzii&amp;lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes in Mali</title><fingerprint>a174f829</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin J.

The fornicata (fornicates) is a eukaryotic group known to consist of free-living and parasitic organisms. Genome datasets of two model fornicate parasites &lt;i&gt;Giardia intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spironucleus salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are well annotated, so far. The nuclear genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; assemblages and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are small in terms of the genome size and simple in genome structure. However, an ancestral genomic structure and gene contents, from which genomes of the fornicate parasites have evolved, remains to be clarified. In order to understand genome evolution in fornicates, here, we present the draft genome sequence of a free-living fornicate, &lt;i&gt;Kipferlia bialata&lt;/i&gt;, the divergence of which is earlier than those of the fornicate parasites, and compare it to the genomes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt;. Our data show that the number of protein genes and introns in &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome are the most abundant in the genomes of three fornicates, reflecting an ancestral state of fornicate genome evolution. Evasion mechanisms of host immunity found in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; are absent in the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt; genome, suggesting that the two parasites acquired the complex membrane surface proteins on the line leading to the common ancestor of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;salmonicida&lt;/i&gt; after the divergence from &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bialata&lt;/i&gt;.

Social exclusion is a painful experience that is felt as a threat to the human need to belong and can lead to increased aggressive and anti-social behaviours, and results in emotional and cognitive numbness. Excluded individuals also seem to show an automatic tuning to positivity: they tend to increase their selective attention towards social acceptance signals. Despite these effects known in the literature, the consequences of social exclusion on social information processing still need to be explored in depth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social exclusion on processing two features that are strictly bound in the appraisal of the meaning of facial expressions: gaze direction and emotional expression. In two experiments (N = 60, N = 45), participants were asked to identify gaze direction or emotional expressions from facial stimuli, in which both these features were manipulated. They performed these tasks in a four-block crossed design after being socially included or excluded using the Cyberball game. Participants’ empathy and self-reported emotions were recorded using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and PANAS questionnaires. The Need Threat Scale and three additional questions were also used as manipulation checks in the second experiment. In both experiments, excluded participants showed to be less accurate than included participants in gaze direction discrimination. Modulatory effects of direct gaze (Experiment 1) and sad expression (Experiment 2) on the effects of social exclusion were found on response times (RTs) in the emotion recognition task. Specific differences in the reaction to social exclusion between males and females were also found in Experiment 2: excluded male participants tended to be less accurate and faster than included male participants, while excluded females showed a more accurate and slower performance than included female participants. No influence of social exclusion on PANAS or EQ scores was found. Results are discussed in the context of the importance of identifying gaze direction in appraisal theories.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195100</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195100</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>How social exclusion modulates social information processing: A behavioural dissociation between facial expressions and gaze direction</title><fingerprint>9cfe13e9</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Bossi, Marcello Gallucci, Paola Ricciardelli&lt;/p&gt;

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations. Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290171v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290171v1?rss=1</link><published>1522220400000</published><title>Profiling copy number alterations in cell-free tumour DNA using a single-reference [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>e3ca74a3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The accurate detection of copy number alterations from the analysis of circulating cell free tumour DNA (ctDNA) in blood is essential to realising the potential of liquid biopsies.

However, being a membrane protein, it is difficult to obtain the 3D crystal structures of GPCRs for virtual screening of ligands by molecular docking. Thus, we evaluated the virtual screening performance of homology models of human GPCRs with respect to the corresponding crystal structures. Among the 19 GPCRs involved in this study, we observed that 10 GPCRs have homology models that have better or comparable performance with respect to the corresponding X-ray structures, making homology models a viable choice for virtual screening. For a small subset of GPCRs, we also explored how certain methods like consensus enrichment and sidechain perturbation affect the utility of homology models in virtual screening, as well as the selectivity between agonists and antagonists. Most notably, consensus enrichment across multiple homology models often yields results comparable to the best performing model, suggesting that ligand candidates predicted with consensus scores from multiple models can be the optimal option in practical applications where X-ray structure is not available and the performance of each model cannot be estimated.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284075v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/284075v1?rss=1</link><published>1521442800000</published><title>A benchmarking study on virtual ligand screening against homology models of human GPCRs [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>adfba6ba</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is an important target class of proteins for drug discovery, with over 27% of FDA-approved drugs targeting GPCRs.

Together, these findings provide guidance on how to achieve robust magnetotaxis and reinforce our original finding that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a suitable model system to study magnetoreception.</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31414</link><published>1523577600000</published><title>Response to comment on &quot;Magnetosensitive neurons mediate geomagnetic orientation in Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;</title><fingerprint>50b89552</fingerprint><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_162be626b71:14b0a95:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523612543857</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31414</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23972-5</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Serzhan Sakipov</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23972-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23972-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uD-BKoU-nkY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23972-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/uD-BKoU-nkY/s41598-018-23972-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23972-5</link><published>1523257200000</published><title>Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6</title><fingerprint>877ed9d0</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6, Published online: 09 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23972-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23972-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ion Permeation Mechanism in Epithelial Calcium Channel TRVP6&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uD-BKoU-nkY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162a9b5209a:142c875:7c9981b6</id><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23972-5/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23972_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width><height>685</height></visual><crawled>1523265642650</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195259</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Hongbo Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hongbo Liu, Binghua Zhu, Shaofu Qiu, Yidan Xia, Beibei Liang, Chaojie Yang, Nian Dong, Yongrui Li, Ying Xiang, Shan Wang, Jing Xie, Muti Mahe, Yansong Sun, Hongbin Song&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; represents one of the major diarrhea-inducing pathogens threatening public health, but its prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profile in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, China, remains unclear. We conducted comprehensive investigation of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance pattern in Xinjiang, identifying 458 &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates between 2008 to 2014. &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; was identified as predominant species, and several &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were isolated, including atypical serotypes 1c, 2c, and 4s. Dominant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; serotypes were 2a, 1b, 2b, and Xv, different from those generally dominant in China. A hybrid serotype pattern was observed, which included the major Chinese serotypes (2a, Xv) and those predominant in Pakistan (1b, 2b). &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; was shown to have a lower frequency compared with that generally observed in China, but an increasing trend of infections associated with this pathogen was observed. Furthermore, a high frequency of drug resistance and different &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; antimicrobial resistance patterns were demonstrated as well, including very severe resistance phenotypes, such as multidrug resistance and resistance to frontline antibiotics. Seventy-five cephalosporin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; isolates were frequently identified with the resistance determinants that can undergo horizontal transfer, such as &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;OXA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;TEM&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;bla&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CTX-M&lt;/sub&gt;, and integrons, facilitating the development of cephalosporin resistance among &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; subtypes. Additionally, genetic analyses demonstrated that all 86 quinolone-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates possess 3–4 mutation sites in quinolone resistance-determining regions, primarily contributing to their resistance to quinolone. However, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sonnei&lt;/i&gt; isolates were not shown to be quinolone resistant. Co-resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones was detected in 17 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt; isolates, and these isolates were additionally multidrug resistant and carried β-lactamase genes and quinolone-resistance determinants. As is demonstrated in this study, dominant serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; were distributed in unique trend with dangerous drug resistance patterns.

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells.

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools.

A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology.

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) is a young field of research in the intersection of philosophy and psychology. It aims to make progress on philosophical questions by using experimental methods traditionally associated with the psychological and behavioral sciences, such as null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Motivated by recent discussions about a methodological crisis in the behavioral sciences, questions have been raised about the methodological standards of x-phi. Here, we focus on one aspect of this question, namely the &lt;i&gt;rate of inconsistencies in statistical reporting&lt;/i&gt;. Previous research has examined the extent to which published articles in psychology and other behavioral sciences present statistical inconsistencies in reporting the results of NHST. In this study, we used the R package statcheck to detect statistical inconsistencies in x-phi, and compared rates of inconsistencies in psychology and philosophy. We found that rates of inconsistencies in x-phi are lower than in the psychological and behavioral sciences. From the point of view of statistical reporting consistency, x-phi seems to do no worse, and perhaps even better, than psychological science.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194360</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7129:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01057</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><author><name>Nicholas P. van der Munnik, Md Symon Jahan Sajib, Melissa A.

The centrosome is a non–membrane-bound cellular compartment consisting of 2 centrioles surrounded by a protein coat termed the pericentriolar material (PCM). Centrioles generally remain physically associated together (a phenomenon called centrosome cohesion), yet how this occurs in the absence of a bounding lipid membrane is unclear. One model posits that pericentriolar fibres formed from rootletin protein directly link centrioles, yet little is known about the structure, biophysical properties, or assembly kinetics of such fibres. Here, I combine live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged rootletin with cell fusion and find previously unrecognised plasticity in centrosome cohesion. Rootletin forms large, diffusionally stable bifurcating fibres, which amass slowly on mature centrioles over many hours from anaphase. Nascent centrioles (procentrioles), in contrast, do not form roots and must be licensed to do so through polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) activity. Transient separation of roots accompanies centriolar repositioning during the interphase, suggesting that centrioles organize as independent units, each containing discrete roots. Indeed, forced induction of duplicate centriole pairs allows independent reshuffling of individual centrioles between the pairs. Therefore collectively, these findings suggest that progressively nucleated polymers mediate the dynamic association of centrioles as either 1 or 2 interphase centrosomes, with implications for the understanding of how non–membrane-bound organelles self-organise.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/44jiWSXqczI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162bafef6cd:c0b2af:76251cdd</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Mahen&lt;/p&gt;

The regulatory role of miRNAs has been explored in ovarian cells, and their effects on gonadal development, apoptosis, ovulation, steroid production and corpus luteum (CL) development have been revealed. In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-29b at different stages of bovine CL development and predicted the target genes of miR-29b. We confirmed that miR-29b reduces the expression of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR), affects progesterone (PROG) secretion and regulates the function of the CL. RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b was significantly higher in functional CL phases than in the regressed CL phase. Immunohistochemistry showed that OXTR was expressed in both large and small CL cells and was mainly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of these cells. We analyzed the expression levels of OXTR and found that transfection with a miR-29b mimic decreased OXTR expression, but transfection with the inhibitor had a limited effect on the expression of the OXTR protein. At the same time, the secretion of PROG was significantly increased in the miR-29b mimic-transfected group. We also analyzed the effect of miR-29b on the apoptosis of CL cells. Finally, we found that miR-29b could promote the proliferation of bovine CL cells. In conclusion, we found that miR-29b reduces the expression of OXTR and can promote PROG secretion and the proliferation of CL cells via OXTR.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195562</link><published>1522875600000</published><title>MiR-29b affects the secretion of PROG and promotes the proliferation of bovine corpus luteum cells</title><fingerprint>b880d74f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ming-Qiang Xu, Hao Jiang, Li-Qun Zhang, Xu-Lei Sun, Dan Luo, Yao Fu, Yan Gao, Bao Yuan, Jia-Bao Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Hill-type muscle models are widely used within the field of biomechanics to predict and understand muscle behaviour, and are often essential where muscle forces cannot be directly measured. However, these models have limited accuracy, particularly during cyclic contractions at the submaximal levels of activation that typically occur during locomotion. To address this issue, recent studies have incorporated effects into Hill-type models that are oftentimes neglected, such as size-dependent, history-dependent, and activation-dependent effects. However, the contribution of these effects on muscle performance has yet to be evaluated under common contractile conditions that reflect the range of activations, strains, and strain rates that occur &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling framework to evaluate modifications to Hill-type muscle models when they contract in cyclic loops that are typical of locomotor muscle function. Here we present a modelling framework composed of a damped harmonic oscillator in series with a Hill-type muscle actuator that consists of a contractile element and parallel elastic element. The intrinsic force-length and force-velocity properties are described using Bezier curves where we present a system to relate physiological parameters to the control points for these curves. The muscle-oscillator system can be geometrically scaled while preserving dynamic and kinematic similarity to investigate the muscle size effects while controlling for the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. The model is driven by time-varying muscle activations that cause the muscle to cyclically contract and drive the dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. Thus, this framework provides a platform to test current and future Hill-type model formulations and explore factors affecting muscle performance in muscles of different sizes under a range of cyclic contractile conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wFWSqfInABw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14d5:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stephanie A.

&lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; (wild sage) is a commonly cultivated herbal medicine plant, which is native to the Mediterranean climate regions of Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. However, it has become an invasive species in semi-arid and arid regions of southern Australia. Two varieties are present in this region, var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt; and var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt;, each of which can be distinguished by differences in morphology and flowering period. Following trials to determine the optimum temperate regime for germination and response to light and dark, seeds of both varieties were tested for their response to variations in pH, moisture stress, salinity, and burial depth. The temperature and light trial was carried out using three different temperature regimes; 30/20°C, 25/15°C and 20/12°C, and two light regimes; 12 hours light/12 hours dark and 24 hours dark, with var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; responding to relatively higher temperatures than var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. The germination rate of neither species was significantly inhibited by complete darkness when compared to rates under periodic light exposure. Both varieties germinated at near optimum rates strongly to very strongly in all pH buffer solutions, from pH 5 to pH 10, but they responded most strongly at neutral pH. Var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; showed slightly more tolerance to reduced moisture availability, moderate to strong salinity, and burial depth, compared to var. &lt;i&gt;verbenaca&lt;/i&gt;. However, even a fairly shallow burial depth of 2 cm completely inhibited germination of both varieties. Thus, in circumstances where both varieties are present in a soil seedbank, var. &lt;i&gt;vernalis&lt;/i&gt; could be expected to establish in more challenging conditions, where moisture is limited and salinity is ‘moderate to high’, implying that it is a more serious threat for invasive weed in conditions where crop plants are already challenged.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194319</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Effect of environmental factors on the germination and emergence of &amp;lt;i&gt;Salvia verbenaca&amp;lt;/i&gt; L. cultivars (&amp;lt;i&gt;verbenaca&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;vernalis&amp;lt;/i&gt;): An invasive species in semi-arid and arid rangeland regions</title><fingerprint>38320c7d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Muhammad Mansoor Javaid, Singarayer Florentine, Hafiz Haider Ali, Sandra Weller&lt;/p&gt;

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against complement protein C5, is considered to be the current standard of care for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This study describes the generation and preclinical attributes of ALXN1210, a new long-acting anti-C5 mAb, obtained through select modifications to eculizumab to both largely abolish target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) and increase recycling efficiency via the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). To attenuate the effect of TMDD on plasma terminal half-life (t&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;), histidine substitutions were engineered into the complementarity-determining regions of eculizumab to enhance the dissociation rate of the mAb:C5 complex in the acidic early endosome relative to the slightly basic pH of blood. Antibody variants with optimal pH-dependent binding to C5 exhibited little to no TMDD in mice in the presence of human C5. To further enhance the efficiency of FcRn-mediated recycling of the antibody, two additional substitutions were introduced to increase affinity for human FcRn. These substitutions yielded an additional doubling of the t&lt;sub&gt;½&lt;/sub&gt; of surrogate anti-mouse C5 antibodies with reduced TMDD in transgenic mice expressing the human FcRn. In conclusion, ALXN1210 is a promising new therapeutic candidate currently in clinical development for treatment of patients with PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195909</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Design and preclinical characterization of ALXN1210: A novel anti-C5 antibody with extended duration of action</title><fingerprint>715cda6d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Douglas Sheridan, Zhao-Xue Yu, Yuchun Zhang, Rekha Patel, Fang Sun, Melissa A.

Recent data suggest the existence of a complement alternative pathway activation in the pathogenesis of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a condition that remains poorly understood. This study aims to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) patients with regard to their plasma complement levels at diagnosis. A retrospective monocentric study carried out at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of proteinase-3- or myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA and MPA patients from January 2000 to June 2016 and from September 2011 to June 2016, respectively. All patients with available C3 and C4 levels at diagnosis were included. Patients were categorized in the hypocomplementemia group if their C3 and/or C4 levels at diagnosis were below the lower limit of the normal range. Among the 76 AAV patients (43 GPA, 33 MPA), 4 (5%) had hypocomplementemia, and the 72 remaining patients exhibited normal plasma complement levels. All 4 hypocomplementemia patients had renal involvement. Hypocomplementemia was followed in 1 patient whose post-treatment complement level normalized within 1 month. Among all clinical and ANCA specificity, including relapse-free survival (p = 0.093), only overall and renal survival rates were significantly lower in the hypocomplementemia group (p = 0.0011 and p&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). Hypocomplementemia with low C3 and/or C4 levels at GPA or MPA diagnosis may be responsible for worse survival and renal prognosis. These results argue for larger and prospective studies to better determine the epidemiology of the disease and to assess complement-targeting therapy in these patients.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195680</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Hypocomplementemia is associated with worse renal survival in ANCA-positive granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis</title><fingerprint>f834d69c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Deshayes, Achille Aouba, Kathy Khoy, Delphine Mariotte, Thierry Lobbedez, Nicolas Martin Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Data, including information generated from them by processing and analysis, are an asset with measurable value. The assets that biological research funding produces are the data generated, the information derived from these data, and, ultimately, the discoveries and knowledge these lead to. From the time when Henry Oldenburg published the first scientific journal in 1665 (&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Society&lt;/i&gt;) to the founding of the United States National Library of Medicine in 1879 to the present, there has been a sustained drive to improve how researchers can record and discover what is known. Researchers’ experimental work builds upon years and (collectively) billions of dollars’ worth of earlier work. Today, researchers are generating data at ever-faster rates because of advances in instrumentation and technology, coupled with decreases in production costs. Unfortunately, the ability of researchers to manage and disseminate their results has not kept pace, so their work cannot achieve its maximal impact. Strides have recently been made, but more awareness is needed of the essential role that biological data resources, including biocuration, play in maintaining and linking this ever-growing flood of data and information. The aim of this paper is to describe the nature of data as an asset, the role biocurators play in increasing its value, and consistent, practical means to measure effectiveness that can guide planning and justify costs in biological research information resources’ development and management.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x-fSctih6cc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162cf9286df:ce449:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by International Society for Biocuration &lt;/p&gt;

The existing protein complex detection methods can be broadly divided into two categories: unsupervised and supervised learning methods. Most of the unsupervised learning methods assume that protein complexes are in dense regions of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks even though many true complexes are not dense subgraphs. Supervised learning methods utilize the informative properties of known complexes; they often extract features from existing complexes and then use the features to train a classification model. The trained model is used to guide the search process for new complexes. However, insufficient extracted features, noise in the PPI data and the incompleteness of complex data make the classification model imprecise. Consequently, the classification model is not sufficient for guiding the detection of complexes. Therefore, we propose a new robust score function that combines the classification model with local structural information. Based on the score function, we provide a search method that works both forwards and backwards. The results from experiments on six benchmark PPI datasets and three protein complex datasets show that our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods for protein complex detection, occasionally significantly outperforming such methods.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194124</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Predicting protein complexes using a supervised learning method combined with local structural information</title><fingerprint>608c2992</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yadong Dong, Yongqi Sun, Chao Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In patients with liver cirrhosis, cardiac dysfunction is frequent and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis seems to be linked to autonomic dysfunction. This study investigates the role of autonomic dysfunction assessed by Heart Rate Turbulence (HRT) analyses in patients with liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and patients &lt;p&gt;Inclusion criteria was (1) diagnosis of cirrhosis by clinical, imaging or biopsy and (2) evaluation by standard 12-lead-ECG and 24h holter monitoring and (3) at least 3 premature ventricular contractions. The exclusion criterion was presence of cardiac diseases, independent of liver cirrhosis. Biochemical parameters were analysed using standard methods. HRT was assessed using Turbulence onset (TO) and slope (TS). The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03). Nevertheless, at least in our collective HRT-parameters were not independent predictors of deterioration of cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Parameters of HRT are closely associated with deterioration of cirrhosis and might be helpful in its prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195631</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195631</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Severe abnormal Heart Rate Turbulence Onset is associated with deterioration of liver cirrhosis</title><fingerprint>98b725f4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christian Jansen, Baravan Al-Kassou, Jennifer Lehmann, Alessandra Pohlmann, Johannes Chang, Michael Praktiknjo, Georg Nickenig, Christian P.

The endpoint was deterioration of liver cirrhosis defined as increased MELD and readmission for complications of liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Out of 122 cirrhotic patients, 82 patients (63% male) with median Child score of 6 (range 5–12) and median MELD score of 10 (range 6–32) were included. Increasing Child score, INR and decreasing albumin were correlated with TO. In addition, decompensated patients with ascites showed more abnormal TO and TS. During the observation period, patients with more abnormal TO showed significantly higher rate of rising MELD Score at 6 months (p = 0.03). Nevertheless, at least in our collective HRT-parameters were not independent predictors of deterioration of cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Parameters of HRT are closely associated with deterioration of cirrhosis and might be helpful in its prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195631</canonicalUrl><updated>1523394000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b8:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1443?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><author><name>Sundin, J., Jutfelt, F.</name></author><engagement>328</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1443?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6383/1443?rss=1</link><published>1522345097000</published><title>Keeping science honest</title><fingerprint>d5b83788</fingerprint><keywords><item>Editorials</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_16272fc2773:73e7c9b:34f43e70</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522347550579</crawled><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6383/1443.full</canonicalUrl></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Jonathan Ross</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Loss to care is high among asymptomatic HIV-infected women initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. However, whether pregnancy itself plays a role in the high loss to care rate is uncertain. We compared loss to care over seven years between pregnant and non-pregnant women at enrollment into HIV care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ART-naive women aged 15–45 initiating HIV care at two large clinics in Kinshasa, DRC, from 2007–2013. Pregnancy status was recorded at care enrollment. Patients were classified as having no follow-up if they did not return to care after the initial enrollment visit. Among those with at least one follow-up visit after enrollment, we classified patients as lost to care if more than 365 days had passed since their last clinic visit. We used logistic regression to model the association between pregnancy status and no follow-up, and Cox proportional hazards regression to model the association between pregnancy status and time to loss to care.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 2175 women included in the analysis, 1497 (68.8%) were pregnant at enrollment. Compared to non-pregnant women, pregnant women were less likely to be over 35 years of age (19.1% vs. 31.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and less likely to be in WHO stage III or IV (9.0% vs. 26.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Among pregnant women, 106 (7.1%) were not seen after enrollment, versus 25 (3.7%) non-pregnant women (adjusted odds ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.24). Of the 2,044 women with at least one follow-up visit, 46.5% of pregnant women and 46.7% of non-pregnant women were lost to care by 5 years; hazards of loss to care were similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women (adjusted hazard ratio 1.08, 95% CI 0.93–1.26).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this large cohort of HIV-infected women, patients pregnant at care enrollment were more likely to never return for follow-up. Among those who attended at least one follow-up visit, loss to care was not different between pregnant and non-pregnant women, suggesting that pregnancy itself may not be the main driver of the high attrition observed in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195231</link><published>1522702800000</published><title>Association between pregnancy at enrollment into HIV care and loss to care among women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2006-2013</title><fingerprint>e9c8c069</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Ross, Andrew Edmonds, Donald R.

Recent studies have demonstrated how the competition for the finite pool of available gene expression factors has important effect on fundamental gene expression aspects. In this study, based on a whole-cell model simulation of translation in &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, we evaluate for the first time the expected effect of mRNA levels fluctuations on translation due to the finite pool of ribosomes. We show that fluctuations of a single gene or a group of genes mRNA levels induce periodic behavior in all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; translation factors and aspects: the ribosomal densities and the translation rates of all &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; mRNAs oscillate. We numerically measure the oscillation amplitudes demonstrating that fluctuations of endogenous and heterologous genes can cause a significant fluctuation of up to 50% in the steady-state translation rates of the rest of the genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate by synonymous mutations that oscillating the levels of mRNAs that experience high ribosomal occupancy (e.g. ribosomal “traffic jam”) induces the largest impact on the translation of the &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genome.
The results reported here should provide novel insights and principles related to the design of synthetic gene expression circuits and related to the evolutionary constraints shaping gene expression of endogenous genes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EeyF-2L0x-k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1522789200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1628c98f9e7:4903e:a077e55f</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoram Zarai, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether preoperative breast dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging kinetic features, assessed using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), can predict survival outcome and tumor aggressiveness in patients with invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between March and December 2011, 301 women who underwent preoperative DCE MR imaging for invasive breast cancer, with CAD data, were identified. All MR images were retrospectively evaluated using a commercially available CAD system. The following kinetic parameters were prospectively recorded for each lesion: initial peak enhancement, the proportion of early phase medium and rapid enhancement, and the proportion of delayed phase persistent, plateau, and washout enhancement. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the association between the kinetic features assessed by CAD and disease-free survival (DFS). The peak signal intensity and kinetic enhancement profiles were compared with the clinical-pathological variables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were 32 recurrences during a mean follow-up time of 55.2 months (range, 5–72 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that a higher peak enhancement (DFS hazard ratio, 1.004 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.001, 1.006]; &lt;i&gt;P =&lt;/i&gt; .013) on DCE MR imaging and a triple-negative subtype (DFS hazard ratio, 21.060 [95% CI: 2.675, 165.780]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .004) were associated with a poorer DFS. Higher peak enhancement was significantly associated with a higher tumor stage, clinical stage, and histologic grade.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Patients with breast cancer who showed higher CAD-derived peak enhancement on breast MR imaging had worse DFS.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypoactive lifestyle contributes to the development of secondary complications and lower quality of life in wheelchair users. There is a need for objective and user-friendly physical activity monitors for wheelchair-dependent individuals in order to increase physical activity through self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback provision.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the validity of Activ8 Activity Monitors to 1) distinguish two classes of activities: independent wheelchair propulsion from other non-propulsive wheelchair-related activities 2) distinguish five wheelchair-related classes of activities differing by the movement intensity level: sitting in a wheelchair (hands may be moving but wheelchair remains stationary), maneuvering, and normal, high speed or assisted wheelchair propulsion.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixteen able-bodied individuals performed sixteen various standardized 60s-activities of daily living. Each participant was equipped with a set of two Activ8 Professional Activity Monitors, one at the right forearm and one at the right wheel. Task classification by the Active8 Monitors was validated using video recordings. For the overall agreement, sensitivity and positive predictive value, outcomes above 90% are considered excellent, between 70 and 90% good, and below 70% unsatisfactory.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Division in two classes resulted in overall agreement of 82.1%, sensitivity of 77.7% and positive predictive value of 78.2%. 84.5% of total duration of all tasks was classified identically by Activ8 and based on the video material. Division in five classes resulted in overall agreement of 56.6%, sensitivity of 52.8% and positive predictive value of 51.9%. 59.8% of total duration of all tasks was classified identically by Activ8 and based on the video material.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Activ8 system proved to be suitable for distinguishing between active wheelchair propulsion and other non-propulsive wheelchair-related activities.

Only the &lt;i&gt;TNFA&lt;/i&gt; -1031T&gt;C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T&gt;C/-308G&gt;A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46–0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt;, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A&gt;G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p&gt;0.05). The &lt;i&gt;TNFRSF1A&lt;/i&gt; c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in &lt;i&gt;MEFV&lt;/i&gt; gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF&amp;lt;0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27).

Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</link><published>1522789200000</published><title>Only multi-taxon studies show the full range of arthropod responses to fire</title><fingerprint>b4de967f</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a significant global public health problem and recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. This study was designed to assess the current prevalence of hypertension and to explore risk factors associated with hypertension by urban and rural status to guide the prevention and control of hypertension in Jilin province.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to obtain data on hypertension, which was investigated by physical examination and face-to-face questionnaire in July 2014-December 2015. Sample data were analyzed by complex weighted statistical analysis to estimate blood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension in the province. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing hypertension rates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of hypertension was significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas (25.93% versus 22.73%, respectively). The rates of hypertension known (46.7% versus 38.1%, respectively), control (13.7% versus 5.0%, respectively), and controlled among treated subjects (38.3% versus 17.5%, respectively) were higher in urban areas than in rural areas (all p &amp;lt; 0.001), while the treatment rate was not statistically significantly different between urban and rural areas (35.9% versus 28.4%, respectively). After adjusting for demographic covariates, hypertension prevalence in rural areas was still significantly greater than in urban areas (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.36; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Common risk factors for hypertension among urban and rural residents included older age; male; married; employed; less education; overweight/obese; greater abdominal waist circumference; family history of hypertension, stroke, or coronary heart disease; current smoker; alcohol consumption; higher visceral adiposity index; and higher body fat percentage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study identified an increased risk for hypertension in rural regions of Jilin province, suggesting that rural hypertension screening and treatment guidelines should receive greater attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195340</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195340</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Differences in prevalence of hypertension and associated risk factors in urban and rural residents of the northeastern region of the People’s Republic of China: A cross-sectional study</title><fingerprint>54c604a4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Junnan Wang, Wei Sun, George A.

We conduct experiments on two different datasets; the proposed approach yields single-cell embeddings that are more accurate than the widely adopted classical features, and are competitive with previously proposed transfer learning approaches.</content></content><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/02/293431</canonicalUrl><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162879d6d44:8f093c2:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522693664068</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0140-2</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><author><name>László Acsády</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heartless beat or beatless heart?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartless beat or beatless heart?, Published online: 16 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0140-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0140-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Recurring bursts of thalamocortical cells were thought to be indispensable in driving absence seizures.

The ability of astrocytes to rapidly clear synaptic glutamate and purposefully release the excitatory transmitter is critical in the functioning of synapses and neuronal circuits. Dysfunctions of these homeostatic functions have been implicated in the pathology of brain disorders such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the reasons for these dysfunctions are not clear from experimental data and computational models have been developed to provide further understanding of the implications of glutamate clearance from the extracellular space, as a result of EAAT2 downregulation: although they only partially account for the glutamate clearance process. In this work, we develop an explicit model of the astrocytic glutamate transporters, providing a more complete description of the glutamate chemical potential across the astrocytic membrane and its contribution to glutamate transporter driving force based on thermodynamic principles and experimental data. Analysis of our model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate content due to glutamine synthetase downregulation also results in increased postsynaptic quantal size due to gliotransmission. Moreover, the proposed model demonstrates that increased astrocytic glutamate could prolong the time course of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and enhances astrocyte-induced slow inward currents, causing a disruption to the clarity of synaptic signalling and the occurrence of intervals of higher frequency postsynaptic firing. Overall, our work distilled the necessity of a low astrocytic glutamate concentration for reliable synaptic transmission of information and the possible implications of enhanced glutamate levels as in epilepsy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cj--aAPMpfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1523912400000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162cf9248c9:ec14ce:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bronac Flanagan, Liam McDaid, John Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Data are lacking on the risk and impact of a serious hemorrhage on the prognosis after ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA). We aimed to estimate the incidence of serious hemorrhage, analyze the impact on mortality, and identify predictors of hemorrhage after discharge from IS or TIA.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;All patients admitted to Östersund Hospital for an IS or TIA in 2010–2013 were included (n = 1528, mean age: 75.1 years). Serious hemorrhages were identified until 31&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; December 2015. Incidence rates were calculated. The impact on mortality (stratified by functional level) was determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Non-parametric estimation under the assumption of competing risk was performed to assess the cumulative incidence and predictors of serious hemorrhages.The incidence rates of serious (n = 113) and intracranial hemorrhages (n = 45) after discharge from IS and TIA were 2.48% and 0.96% per year at risk, respectively. Patients with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 3–5 exhibited 58.9% mortality during follow-up and those with mRS scores of 0–2 exhibited 18.4% mortality. A serious hemorrhage did not affect mortality in patients with impaired functional status, but it increased the risk of death in patients with mRS scores of 0–2. Hypertension was associated with increased risk of serious hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found that, after discharge from an IS or TIA, serious hemorrhages were fairly common. Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Serious hemorrhages after ischemic stroke or TIA – Incidence, mortality, and predictors</title><fingerprint>fc4e7cf8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joachim Ögren, Anna-Lotta Irewall, Lars Söderström, Thomas Mooe&lt;/p&gt;

Impairments in function were associated with high mortality, but serious hemorrhages only increased the risk of mortality in patients with no or slight disability. Improved hypertension treatment may decrease the risk of serious hemorrhage, but in patients with low functional status, poor survival makes secondary prevention challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195324</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</link><published>1522662194705</published><unread>True</unread><fingerprint>dbe24ec4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16285bd3e11:8aa3033:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522662194705</crawled><title>Quantum chemical exploration of formaldehyde clusters (H2CO)n (n = 2–4)</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Jennifer E.

Tristan da Cunha Islands, an archipelago of four rocky volcanic islands situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and part of the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), present a rare example of a relatively unimpacted temperate marine ecosystem. We conducted the first quantitative surveys of nearshore kelp forests, offshore pelagic waters and deep sea habitats. Kelp forests had very low biodiversity and species richness, but high biomass and abundance of those species present. Spatial variation in assemblage structure for both nearshore fish and invertebrates/algae was greatest between the three northern islands and the southern island of Gough, where sea temperatures were on average 3-4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; colder. Despite a lobster fishery that provides the bulk of the income to the Tristan islands, lobster abundance and biomass are comparable to or greater than many Marine Protected Areas in other parts of the world. Pelagic camera surveys documented a rich biodiversity offshore, including large numbers of juvenile blue sharks, &lt;i&gt;Prionace glauca&lt;/i&gt;. Species richness and abundance in the deep sea is positively related to hard rocky substrate and biogenic habitats such as sea pens, crinoids, whip corals, and gorgonians were present at 40% of the deep camera deployments. We observed distinct differences in the deep fish community above and below ~750 m depth. Concurrent oceanographic sampling showed a discontinuity in temperature and salinity at this depth. While currently healthy, Tristan’s marine ecosystem is not without potential threats: shipping traffic leading to wrecks and species introductions, pressure to increase fishing effort beyond sustainable levels and the impacts of climate change all could potentially increase in the coming years. The United Kingdom has committed to protection of marine environments across the UKOTs, including Tristan da Cunha and these results can be used to inform future management decisions as well as provide a baseline against which future monitoring can be based.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195167</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>First quantification of subtidal community structure at Tristan da Cunha Islands in the remote South Atlantic: from kelp forests to the deep sea</title><fingerprint>505b6b33</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer E.

Background &lt;p&gt;In urban Maharashtra, India, approximately half of mothers exclusively breastfeed. For children residing in informal settlements of Mumbai, this study examines factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding, and whether exclusive breastfeeding, in a community-based nutrition program to prevent and treat wasting among children under age three, is associated with enrolment during the mother’s pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The nutrition program conducted a cross-sectional endline survey (October-December 2015) of caregivers in intervention areas. Factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding for infants under six months of age were explored using multi-level logistic regressions. Additionally, program surveillance data collected during home-based counselling visits documented breastfeeding practices for children under six months of age. Using the surveillance data (January 2014-March 2016), exclusive breastfeeding status was regressed adjusting for child, maternal and socioeconomic characteristics, and whether the child was enrolled in the program in utero or after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The community-based endline survey included 888 mothers of infants. Mothers who received the nutrition program home visits or attended group counselling sessions were more likely to exclusively breastfeed (adjusted odds ratio 1.67, 95% CI 1.16, 2.41). Having a normal weight-for-height z-score (adjusted odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.00, 2.45) was associated positively with exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, being an older infant aged three to five months (adjusted odds ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.25, 0.48) and receiving a prelacteal feed after birth (adjusted odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.41, 0.80) were associated with lower odds of exclusively breastfeeding. Surveillance data (N = 3420) indicate that infants enrolled in utero have significantly higher odds of being exclusively breastfed (adjusted odds ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.30, 1.84) than infants enrolled after birth.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Prenatal enrolment in community-based programs working on child nutrition in urban informal settlements of India can improve exclusive breastfeeding practices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195619</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Participation of pregnant women in a community-based nutrition program in Mumbai&apos;s informal settlements: Effect on exclusive breastfeeding practices</title><fingerprint>cee06caa</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sheila Chanani, Anagha Waingankar, Neena Shah More, Shanti Pantvaidya, Armida Fernandez, Anuja Jayaraman&lt;/p&gt;

A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C39wpIQO--A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1521493200000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1623f563f80:158030a:bdf8aaf1</id><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yered Pita-Juárez, Gabriel Altschuler, Sokratis Kariotis, Wenbin Wei, Katjuša Koler, Claire Green, Rudolph E.

We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships.

We investigated the numbers of planktonic and biofilm cells and the expression levels of genes encoding efflux pumps and biofilm-related proteins in 10 clinical isolates of multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (MDRA) as well as in its standard strain ATCC 19606 in the presence of colistin (CST), polymyxin B (PMB), minomycin (MIN), and tigecycline (TGC) at their respective sub-MICs. The number of planktonic and biofilm cells of ATCC 19606 decreased in the presence of all aforementioned antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner. Cell number also decreased in two representative MDRA strains, R2 and R3, in the presence of MIN and TGC in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the number of biofilm cells in these two strains increased in the presence of CST, while they increased significantly in the presence of PMB in R2 only. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that the number of biofilm cells was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding efflux pumps (&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;) and autoinducer synthase (&lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt;) in strain R2 and &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeG&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;adeJ&lt;/i&gt;, poly-acetyl-glucosamine-porin (&lt;i&gt;pgaA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;abaI&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of CST. It was positively and significantly correlated with the mRNA levels of genes encoding &lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; in strain R2 and an outer membrane protein A (&lt;i&gt;ompA&lt;/i&gt;) and biofilm-associated protein (&lt;i&gt;bap)&lt;/i&gt; in strain R3 in the presence of PMB. These results provide valuable insights into the biofilm formation potency of clinical isolates of MDRA that depends on efflux pumps and biofilm-related genes and its regulation by antibiotics.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194556</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194556</link><published>1521493200000</published><title>Sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations of colistin and polymyxin B promote &amp;lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&amp;lt;/i&gt; biofilm formation</title><fingerprint>5756cd68</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshinori Sato, Yuka Unno, Tsuneyuki Ubagai, Yasuo Ono&lt;/p&gt;

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</link><published>1523998800000</published><title>The effect of mood state on visual search times for detecting a target in noise: An application of smartphone technology</title><fingerprint>1ceb0ce8</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence suggests the presence of structural changes affecting the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in patients with Brugada Syndrome (BrS). The aim of this study was to characterise the RV morphology in BrS and explore associations between morphologic, clinical, electrical, and genetic parameters using non-invasive multimodality testing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive BrS patients (recruited 2013–2015) underwent clinical assessment, dedicated RV imaging using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (unless contra-indicated), electrical assessment (electrocardiogram, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged ECG[SAECG]) and genotyping. Morphologic data were compared to matched control and unmatched ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) cohorts, and potential associations between morphologic parameters and other variables were explored.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;BrS patients (n = 42, male 86%, age 46±12 years) exhibited normal global RV volume and function, comparable to control, in contrast to significantly larger, impaired RVs in ARVC cohort (RVESV p = 0.0001; RVEDV p&amp;lt;0.0001, RVEF p = 0.002). Compared with control, BrS patients exhibited larger RVOT volumes (7.4 ± 0.7 vs 5.8 ± 0.7 mL/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) (31% vs 0%, p = 0.005); compared with ARVC cohort, the RVOT volumes were similar (7.4 ± 0.7 vs, 8.1 ± 1.7, p = 0.52) and there were less RWMA (31% vs 76%, p = 0.01).

The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides. Our results showed that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra were very close to the real-experimental spectra and had a relative-error distribution centered around 25%.

[NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>e6050c6</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has become an essential tool in the study of proteins. The big data from MS machines has led to the development of novel serial and parallel algorithmic tools. However, the absence of data benchmarks and ground truth makes the algorithmic integrity testing and reproducibility a challenging problem. To this end, we present MaSS-Simulator, which is an easy to use simulator and can be configured to generate MS/MS datasets for a wide variety of conditions with known ground truths. MaSS-Simulator offers a large number of configuration options to simulate control datasets with desired properties thus enabling rigorous and large scale algorithmic testing. We assessed 8,031 spectra generated by MaSS-Simulator by comparing them against the experimentally generated spectra of same peptides. Our results showed that MaSS-Simulator generated spectra were very close to the real-experimental spectra and had a relative-error distribution centered around 25%. In contrast the theoretical spectra for same peptides had relative-error distribution centered around 150%.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a simple marker of inflammation, has recently been showed to predict tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after hepatic resection or liver transplantation. However, whether it can be used to predict HCC development in cirrhotic patients remained unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the preoperative NLR for the development of HCC in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy. A total of 230 HBV-associated cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy in our hospital from January 2000 to December 2012 were included in this study. Detailed clinical data included patients’ general characteristics, laboratory tests and imaging studies, surgical procedures and complications. Information on patients’ follow-up data was also obtained. We found that 38 (16.52%) patients developed HCC after splenectomy during the follow-up period. An elevated preoperative NLR was associated with increased risk of developing HCC in cirrhotic patients after splenectomy. The optimal cutoff value of NLR for HCC development was 2.27. In patients who developed HCC during the follow-up period, NLR scores showed no predictive value in overall survival after splenectomy. However, NLR scores appeared to have a much better predictive value in overall survival in patients who did not develop HCC. In conclusion, cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy remain at a relatively high risk of developing HCC, and an elevated preoperative NLR is associated with HCC development in cirrhotic patients who underwent splenectomy for hypersplenism.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195336</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Predictive value of the preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV-associated cirrhotic patients after splenectomy</title><fingerprint>fd6c6806</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhaoqing Du, Jian Dong, Jianbin Bi, Ruhai Bai, Jia Zhang, Zheng Wu, Yi Lv, Xufeng Zhang, Rongqian Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Almost one third of the three million people in China suffering severe deafness are children, and 50% of these cases are believed to have genetic components to their etiology. Newborn hearing genetic screening can complement Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening for the diagnosis of congenital hearing loss as well as identifying children at risk for late-onset and progressive hearing impairment. The aim of this joint academic and Ministry of Health project was to prototype a cost effective newborn genetic screen in a community health setting on a city-wide level, and to ascertain the prevalence of variation at loci that have been associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. With the participation of 143 local hospitals in the city of Wuhan, China we screened 142,417 neonates born between May 2014 and Dec. 2015. The variants GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G, and mitochondrial variants m.1555A&gt;G and m.1494C&gt;T were assayed using real time PCR. Newborns found to carry a variant were re-assayed by sequencing in duplicate. Within a subset of 707 newborns we assayed using real-time PCR and ARMS-PCR to compare cost, sensitivity and operating procedure. The most frequent hearing loss associated allele detected in this population was the 235delC variant in GJB2 gene. In total, 4289 (3.01%) newborns were found to carry at least one allele of either GJB2 c.235delC, SLC26A4 c.919-2A&gt;G or two assayed MT-RNR1 variants. There was complete accordance between the real-time PCR and the ARMS PCR, though the real-time PCR had a much lower failure rate. Real-time PCR had a lower cost and operating time than ARMS PCR. Ongoing collaboration with the participating hospitals will determine the specificity and sensitivity of the association of the variants with hearing loss at birth and arising in early childhood, allowing an estimation of the benefits of newborn hearing genetic screening in a large-scale community setting.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195740</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195740</link><published>1523394000000</published><title>Large scale newborn deafness genetic screening of 142,417 neonates in Wuhan, China</title><fingerprint>70f1f354</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zongjie Hao, Denggang Fu, Yang Ming, Jinlong Yang, Qi Huang, Weilong Lin, Huan Zhang, Bin Zhang, Aifen Zhou, Xijiang Hu, Cong Yao, Yunping Dong, Huijun Z.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy arising from consumption of both coagulation factors and platelets. DIC is triggered by a number of clinical conditions including severe infection, trauma and obstetric complications. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition is paramount. A high clinical index of suspicion is needed to ensure that patients at risk of developing DIC are appropriately investigated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In order to establish the clinical conditions most frequently associated with DIC, we reviewed all DIC screens received at a tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The commonest clinical condition associated with DIC in our population was infection with 84% of patients infected with an identified pathogen. The most frequently diagnosed pathogen was HIV followed by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; and other bacterial infections. In the majority of cases, bacteria were isolated from blood cultures. In 47 patients, HIV was the only pathogen which could be isolated. A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195793</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195793</link><published>1523566800000</published><title>Pathogenic factors associated with development of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) in a tertiary academic hospital in South Africa</title><fingerprint>cfe66945</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth S.

A relative risk ratio of 2.73 and an odds ratio of 29.97 was attributed to HIV for development of a DIC. A malignancy was present in 51 of the patients of which approximately 60% had co-existing infection. No cause could be attributed in 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Infection was identified in the majority of the patients diagnosed with DIC in this study. HIV showed the highest relative risk ratio of all pathogens although previous studies have not suggested that HIV was strongly associated with DIC. In almost half of the HIV infected patients, there was no other pathogen isolated despite extensive investigation. This suggests that HIV has a strong association with the development of DIC, warranting further research into the relationship between HIV and disseminated microvascular thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195793</canonicalUrl><updated>1523566800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162bb068c91:fd66cb:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523556191377</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5018135?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>R.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</link><published>1522962000000</published><title>Co-morbid mental disability among Chinese elderly with motor disability: Based on a nationwide survey</title><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</canonicalUrl><updated>1522962000000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d740:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25152?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25152?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25152?af=R</link><published>1522120330699</published><unread>False</unread><fingerprint>17ed10ed</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16265710dcb:6ce14:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522120330699</crawled></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><author><name>Liang Chen</name></author><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/geFSfaPGz5I/s41467-018-03499-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z</link><published>1522047600000</published><title>TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14</title><fingerprint>ea46eb09</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIM11 activates the proteasome and promotes overall protein degradation by regulating USP14, Published online: 26 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03499-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03499-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The proteasome-bound ubiquitinase USP14 plays an important role in determining proteasome activity and substrate specificity.

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected (HIV+) persons have elevated risks for various manifestations of cardiovascular disease (CVD). No studies to our knowledge have compared atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence and associated characteristics for HIV+ persons and matched uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Persons with diagnoses of HIV receiving care at a large urban academic medical center were frequency-matched 1:2 on age, sex, race, zip code, and clinic location with uninfected persons. Possible AF/AFL was screened for using administrative codes and diagnoses of AF/AFL were subsequently adjudicated using electrocardiography and physician notes; adjudication was performed given the inconsistent validity of administrative code-derived AF diagnoses found in previous studies. There were 101 confirmed AF/AFL cases (2.00%) among 5,052 HIV+ patients and 159 confirmed AF/AFL cases (1.57%) among 10,121 uninfected controls [Odds Ratio (OR) 1.27, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.99–1.64; p = 0.056]. The association between HIV serostatus and AF/AFL was attenuated after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors. Among HIV+ persons, nadir CD4+ T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was associated with approximately twofold elevated odds of AF/AFL even after adjustment for demographics and CVD risk factors (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.21–3.25). There was no significant association between log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; of peak HIV viral load and AF/AFL (Multivariable-adjusted OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86–1.24). Older age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with similarly elevated odds of AF/AFL for HIV+ persons and uninfected controls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;HIV-related immunosuppression (nadir CD4 T cell count &amp;lt;200 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and traditional CVD risk factors are associated with significantly elevated odds of AF/AFL among HIV+ persons.

The process of selecting individual trees by humans for forest management purposes is the result of a plethora of factors and processes that are hard to disentangle. And yet in the past many textbooks and other publications have maintained that this selection leads to somewhat unanimous results. In this study, we analysed the data of 36 so-called marteloscope experiments from all over Britain, which are managed by the Ae Training Centre (Scotland, UK). Our objective was (1) to establish how much agreement there actually was when asking test persons (raters) to apply two different thinning methods, low and crown thinning. In addition we (2) were interested in understanding some of the processes leading to certain levels of agreement and in relationships between the agreement measures and characteristics of forest structure. Our analysis was based on multivariate statistics, particularly using Fleiss’ kappa. This was the first time that an analysis of rater behaviour was performed at such a large scale and it revealed that the general agreement in tree selection in Britain was only slight to fair, i.e. much lower than in medical experiments. The variability of selecting individual trees was considerable. We also found that agreement in tree selection was much stronger in low-thinning as opposed to crown-thinning experiments. As the latter is an important method of Continuous Cover Forestry and British forestry is increasingly adopting this forest management type, our results suggested that there is a need to provide more training. Interestingly the different levels of agreement as identified by Fleiss’ kappa could not be explained by measures of forest structure, however, the mean conformity number, a surrogate of Fleiss’ kappa, showed correlations and indicated that conformity increased with increasing complexity of tree stem diameter structure.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194747</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>Rating experiments in forestry: How much agreement is there in tree marking?</title><fingerprint>54ebcb40</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arne Pommerening, Carlos Pallarés Ramos, Wojciech Kędziora, Jens Haufe, Dietrich Stoyan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Japanese encephalitis virus&lt;/i&gt; (JEV) is a major cause of encephalitis in Asia, and the commonest cause of mosquito-borne encephalitis worldwide. Detection of JEV RNA remains challenging due to the characteristic brief and low viraemia, with 0–25% of patients positive, and the mainstay of diagnosis remains detection of anti-JEV IgM antibody.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review of published RT-PCR protocols, and evaluated them &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; alongside new primers and probes designed using a multiple genome alignment of all JEV strains &gt;9,000nt from GenBank, downloaded from the NCBI website (November 2016). The new assays included pan-genotype and genotype specific assays targeting genotypes 1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten RT-qPCR assays were compared, a pre-existing in-house assay, three published assays and six newly designed assays, using serial RNA dilutions. We selected three assays, one published and two novel assays, with the lowest limit of detection (LOD) for further optimisation and validation. One of the novel assays, detecting NS2A, showed the best results, with LOD approximately 4 copies/ reaction, and no cross-reaction on testing closely related viruses in the JEV serocomplex, &lt;i&gt;West Nile Virus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;St&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Louis Virus&lt;/i&gt;. The optimised assays were validated in consecutive patients with central nervous system infections admitted to hospitals in Laos, testing paired CSF and serum samples.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We succeeded in developing a JEV specific RT-qPCR assay with at least 1 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; improved sensitivity as compared to existing assays.

Further evaluation is required, field-testing the assay in a larger group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194412</canonicalUrl><updated>1521838800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51c6:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><unread>False</unread></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017080?af=R</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><author><name>Yu-Chan Guan</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017080?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5017080?af=R</link><published>1522134556000</published><title>Precision saturated absorption spectroscopy of [math]</title><fingerprint>e2f9da76</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f8901:7d6c1c1c</id><visual><url>none</url></visual><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><unread>True</unread></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196028</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><author><name>Giorgia Antoni</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Giorgia Antoni, Elisabetta Marini, Nicoletta Curreli, Valerio Tuveri, Ornella Comandini, Stefano Cabras, Silvia Gabba, Clelia Madeddu, Antonio Crisafulli, Andrea C.

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore.

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1522346868231</crawled><unread>True</unread><recrawled>1522355043476</recrawled></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291757v1?rss=1</originId><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><author><name>Penfold, C.

During branching, a statistical process bifurcates resulting in two or more potentially correlated processes that may undergo further branching; the contrary is true during recombination, where two or more statistical processes converge into one. A key objective is to identify the time of this bifurcation (branch time) from time series measurements e.g., comparing a control time series with a perturbed time series. Whilst statistical treatments for the two branch (control versus treatment) case exists, the ability to infer more complex branching structure from time series data remains open. Gaussian processes (GPs) represents an ideal framework for such analysis, allowing for nonlinear regression that includes a rigorous treatment of uncertainty.

Here we highlight how arbitrarily complex branching processes can be built using the correct composition of covariance functions within a GP framework, thus outlining a general framework for the treatment of branching and recombination in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian processes (B-RGPs). We first demonstrate the performance of B-RGPs compared to a variety of existing regression approaches, and demonstrate robustness to model misspecification. B-RGPs are then used to investigate the branching patterns of Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression following inoculation with the hemibotrophic bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, and a disarmed mutant strain, hrpA. By grouping genes according to the number of branches, we could naturally separate out genes involved in basal immune response from those subverted by the virulent strain, and show enrichment for targets of pathogen protein effectors. Finally, we identify two early branching genes WRKY11 and WRKY17, and showed that groups of genes that branched at similar times to WRKY11/17 were enriched for W-box binding motifs, and overrepresented for genes differentially expressed in WRKY11/17 knockouts, suggesting that branch time could be used for identifying direct and indirect binding targets of key transcription factors.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291757v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291757v1?rss=1</link><published>1522306800000</published><title>Branch-recombinant Gaussian processes for analysis of perturbations in biological time series [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>319afdb1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A common class of behaviour encountered in the biological sciences involves branching and recombination.

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) plays an essential role in gluconeogenesis. Here we report that the human FBP1 gene is regulated by two liver-enriched transcription factors, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. C/EBPα regulates transcription of FBP1 gene via binding to the two overlapping C/EBPα sites located at nucleotide -228/-208 while HNF4α regulates FBP1 gene through binding to the classical H4-SBM site and direct repeat 3 (DR3) located at nucleotides -566/-554 and -212/-198, respectively. Mutations of these transcription factor binding sites result in marked decrease of C/EBPα- or HNF4α-mediated transcription activation of FBP1 promoter-luciferase reporter expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of -228/-208 C/EBPα or -566/-554 and -212/-198 HNF4α sites with nuclear extract of HepG2 cells overexpressing C/EBPα or HNF4α confirms binding of these two transcription factors to these sites. Finally, we showed that siRNA-mediated suppression of C/EBPα or HNF4α expression in HepG2 cells lowers expression of FBP1 in parallel with down-regulation of expression of other gluconeogenic enzymes. Our results suggest that an overall gluconeogenic program is regulated by these two transcription factors, enabling transcription to occur in a liver-specific manner.</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194252</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194252</link><published>1521752400000</published><title>CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) regulate expression of the human fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells</title><fingerprint>163651e1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Siriluck Wattanavanitchakorn, Pinnara Rojvirat, Tanit Chavalit, Michael J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the number of studies that have tried to demonstrate that there is an association between previous falls and the fear of falling, the relationship between these two variables remains a matter of controversy.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our objective was to investigate whether the fear of falling is a cause of falls, a consequence, or both in community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 75 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A descriptive, longitudinal, prospective study was performed. A total of 640 individuals were interviewed between 2009 and 2011. Sociodemographic data, health status, history of falls and fear of falling were assessed at baseline and at 24 months.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of falls at baseline was 25% as opposed to 35.2% at 24 months. The prevalence of the fear of falling was 41.5% at baseline. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between a history of falls and the fear of falling. Other factors associated with the fear of falling were female gender, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, and disability. In total, 41.7% of the subjects who had reported a fear of falling at baseline had suffered at least one fall 24 months later. Unadjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that the fear of falling was a risk factor for falls. According to the final model adjusted for other covariates, the only reliable predictor was female gender. The Cox model stratified by gender failed to show a crude association between fear of falling and falls.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A previous history of falls in the previous year was a good predictor of the fear of falling; but the fear of falling was a predictor of falls during follow-up only in the unadjusted model, pointing to strong gender turns out as an effect modifier of the association of FOF and subsequent falls. Nursing staff working in elderly care should not only routinely assess patients’ previous history of falls, but also evaluate their fear of falling and its associated factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><engagement>0</engagement><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194967</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194967</link><published>1522357200000</published><title>Fear of falling in community-dwelling older adults: A cause of falls, a consequence, or both?</title><fingerprint>1c21446</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Lavedán, Maria Viladrosa, Pilar Jürschik, Teresa Botigué, Carmen Nuín, Olga Masot, Raquel Lavedán&lt;/p&gt;
