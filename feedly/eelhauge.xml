Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>PROGame: A process framework for serious game development for motor rehabilitation therapy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;

Most children and adolescents with chronic health conditions have impaired health-related quality of life and are at high risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8–18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/ physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was a health-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198402</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Establishing priorities for psychological interventions in pediatric settings: A decision-tree approach using the DISABKIDS-10 Index as a screening instrument</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Silva, Monika Bullinger, Helena Moreira, Maria Cristina Canavarro, Carlos Carona&lt;/p&gt;

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197290</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A qualitative study on perceptions of surgical careers in Rwanda: A gender-based approach</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Pomegranate fruit consumption has increased rapidly throughout the world, mainly because of its medical and nutritive attributes. Thus, considerable commercial and scientific interest exists in prolonging its postharvest life with non-chemical applications as much as possible to meet the year-round demand for this fruit. The present work aimed to study the effects of black seed oil (0.1% and 0.5%), propolis (0.01% and 0.1%) and fludioxonil (0.06%), with and without modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on the postharvest quality of pomegranate cv. Wonderful. Treated fruits were stored at 6.5±1 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 150 days. The results indicated that both black seed oil and propolis treatments significantly influenced the maintenance of fruit weight and quality. At 150 days after storage, the fruit weight loss of the samples treated with MAP + 0.5% black seed oil, MAP + 0.1% propolis and MAP alone were found to be 5.5%, 6.3%, and 9.1%, respectively, whereas the weight loss of the untreated control fruits was 19.8%. Application of either 0.5% black seed oil or 0.1% propolis, especially when combined with MAP, was also effective in controlling gray mold development and slowing the occurrence of chilling injury.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of fludioxonil, propolis and black seed oil application on the postharvest quality of “Wonderful” pomegranate</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by İbrahim Kahramanoğlu, Mehmet Aktaş, Şerife Gündüz&lt;/p&gt;

Accurate identification of preterm infants is important at the individual level for appropriate clinical intervention as well as at the population level for informed policy decisions and resource allocation. As early prenatal ultrasound is commonly not available in these settings, gestational age (GA) is often estimated using newborn assessment at birth. This approach assumes last menstrual period to be unreliable and birthweight to be unable to distinguish preterm infants from those that are small for gestational age (SGA). We sought to leverage machine learning algorithms incorporating maternal factors associated with SGA to improve accuracy of preterm newborn identification in LMIC settings. Methods and Findings: This study uses data from an ongoing obstetrical cohort in Lusaka, Zambia that uses early pregnancy ultrasound to estimate GA. Our intent was to identify the best set of parameters commonly available at delivery to correctly categorize births as either preterm (&amp;lt;37 weeks) or term, compared to GA assigned by early ultrasound as the gold standard. Trained midwives conducted a newborn assessment (&amp;lt;72 hours) and collected maternal and neonatal data at the time of delivery or shortly thereafter. New Ballard Score (NBS), last menstrual period (LMP), and birth weight were used individually to assign GA at delivery and categorize each birth as either preterm or term. Additionally, machine learning techniques incorporated combinations of these measures with several maternal and newborn characteristics associated with prematurity and SGA to develop GA at delivery and preterm birth prediction models. The distribution and accuracy of all models were compared to early ultrasound dating. Within our live-born cohort to date (n = 862), the median GA at delivery by early ultrasound was 39.4 weeks (IQR: 38.3 - 40.3). Among assessed newborns with complete data included in this analysis (n = 458), the median GA by ultrasound was 39.6 weeks (IQR: 38.4 - 40.3). Using machine learning, we identified a combination of six accessible parameters (LMP, birth weight, twin delivery, maternal height, hypertension in labor, and HIV serostatus) that can be used by machine learning to outperform current GA prediction methods. For preterm birth prediction, this combination of covariates correctly classified &gt;94% of newborns and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9796. Conclusions: We identified a parsimonious list of variables that can be used by machine learning approaches to improve accuracy of preterm newborn identification. Our best performing model included LMP, birth weight, twin delivery, HIV serostatus, and maternal factors associated with SGA. These variables are all easily collected at delivery, reducing the skill and time required by the frontline health worker to assess GA.</description><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>83b932db</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334904v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Globally, preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal death with estimated prevalence and associated mortality highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

There is a current interest in quantifying time-varying connectivity (TVC) based on neuroimaging data such as fMRI. Many methods have been proposed, and are being applied, revealing new insight into the brain’s dynamics. However, given that the ground truth for TVC in the brain is unknown, many concerns remain regarding the accuracy of proposed estimates. Since there exist many TVC methods it is difficult to assess differences in time-varying connectivity between studies. In this paper, we present &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt;, which is a Python package containing four simulations to test TVC methods. Here, we evaluate five different methods that together represent a wide spectrum of current approaches to estimating TVC (sliding window, tapered sliding window, multiplication of temporal derivatives, spatial distance and jackknife correlation). These simulations were designed to test each method’s ability to track changes in covariance over time, which is a key property in TVC analysis. We found that all tested methods correlated positively with each other, but there were large differences in the strength of the correlations between methods. To facilitate comparisons with future TVC methods, we propose that the described simulations can act as benchmark tests for evaluation of methods. Using &lt;i&gt;tvc_benchmarker&lt;/i&gt; researchers can easily add, compare and submit their own TVC methods to evaluate its performance.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PcnqFhi9tsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>ef7008cb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006196</link><title>Simulations to benchmark time-varying connectivity methods for fMRI</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William Hedley Thompson, Craig Geoffrey Richter, Pontus Plavén-Sigray, Peter Fransson&lt;/p&gt;

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</description><published>1526331600000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a processive mechanism of exolytic lytic transglycosylase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

Merosin deficient congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;LAMA2&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to severe and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Although over 350 causative mutations have been identified for MDC1A, no treatment is yet available. There are many therapeutic approaches in development, but the lack of natural history data of the mouse model and standardized outcome measures makes it difficult to transit these pre-clinical findings to clinical trials. Therefore, in the present study, we collected natural history data and assessed pre-clinical outcome measures for the &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model using standardized operating procedures available from the TREAT-NMD Alliance. Wild type and &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice were subjected to five different functional tests from the age of four to 32 weeks. Non-tested control groups were taken along to assess whether the functional test regime interfered with muscle pathology. Respiratory function, body weights and creatine kinase levels were recorded. Lastly, skeletal muscles were collected for further histopathological and gene expression analyses. Muscle function of &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice was severely impaired at four weeks of age and all mice lost the ability to use their hind limbs. Moreover, respiratory function was altered in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly. Our study presents a complete natural history dataset which can be used in setting up standardized studies in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197388</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Natural disease history of the &amp;lt;i&gt;dy2J&amp;lt;/i&gt; mouse model of laminin α2 (merosin)-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by S.

Interestingly, the respiration rate was decreased and declined with age, whereas the respiration amplitude was increased in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice when compared to wild type mice. Creatine kinase levels were comparable to wild type mice. Muscle histopathology and gene expression analysis revealed that there was a specific regional distribution pattern of muscle damage in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Gastrocnemius appeared to be the most severely affected muscle with a high proportion of atrophic fibers, increased fibrosis and inflammation. By contrast, triceps was affected moderately and diaphragm only mildly. Our study presents a complete natural history dataset which can be used in setting up standardized studies in &lt;i&gt;dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;/dy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mice.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>S.

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>c3e2c303</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006150</link><title>Structural organization and energy storage in crosslinked actin assemblies</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Ma, Julien Berro&lt;/p&gt;

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197814</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Spatial abundance models and seasonal distribution for guanaco (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, Argentina</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197269</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>User evaluations offer promise for pod-intravaginal ring as a drug delivery platform: A mixed methods study of acceptability and use experiences</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate M.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Jinming Du</name></author><fingerprint>af3e2990</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197574</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197574</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526887776990</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163819a82de:61571cb:3dd877af</id><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025628?af=R</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526448071000</published><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025628?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Deriving uniform semiclassical approximations for one-dimensional fermionic systems</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Raphael F.

We determined the filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests, based on confirmed occurrence records, to better understand how tree diversity in wetland environments compares to tree diversity in the entire Amazon region. The tree species pool was determined using data from two main sources: 1) a compilation of published tree species lists plus one unpublished list of our own, derived from tree plot inventories and floristic surveys; 2) queries on botanical collections that include Amazonian flora, curated by herbaria and available through the SpeciesLink digital biodiversity database. We applied taxonomic name resolution and determined sample-based species accumulation curves for both datasets, to estimate sampling effort and predict the expected species richness using Chao’s analytical estimators. We report a total of 3 615 valid tree species occurring in Amazonian wetland forests. After surveying almost 70 years of research efforts to inventory the diversity of Amazonian wetland trees, we found that 74% these records were registered in published species lists (2 688 tree species). Tree species richness estimates predicted from either single dataset underestimated the total pooled species richness recorded as occurring in Amazonian wetlands, with only 41% of the species shared by both datasets. The filtered tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests comprises 53% of the 6 727 tree species taxonomically confirmed for the Amazonian tree flora to date. This large proportion is likely to be the result of significant species interchange among forest habitats within the Amazon region, as well as &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; speciation processes due to strong ecological filtering. The provided tree species pool raises the number of tree species previously reported as occurring in Amazonian wetlands by a factor of 3.2.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198130</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The tree species pool of Amazonian wetland forests: Which species can assemble in periodically waterlogged habitats?</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Garcia Luize, José Leonardo Lima Magalhães, Helder Queiroz, Maria Aparecida Lopes, Eduardo Martins Venticinque, Evlyn Márcia Leão de Moraes Novo, Thiago Sanna Freire Silva&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Both osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) and inflammatory arthritis can lead to osteoarticular structural damage. These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 83 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a composite reference standard (CRS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 49 out of 83 patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and MGIT 960 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.096, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.413, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198600</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for osteoarticular tuberculosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Li, Wenyun Jia, Guohua Lei, Dan Zhao, Guirong Wang, Shibing Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Together, these results indicate that MD-AD is particularly useful for learning expressive network representations from heterogeneous and sparsely labeled AD data.</content></content><title>MD-AD: Multi-task deep learning for Alzheimer&apos;s disease neuropathology [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Beebe-Wang, N.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/27/331942</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331942v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Molecular mechanics force fields define how the energy and forces of a molecular system are computed from its atomic positions, and enable the study of such systems through computational methods like molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Determining the effects of nitrogen rate on cotton root growth and distribution with soil cores and minirhizotrons</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Studies on &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; would benefit from the introduction of new selectable markers to allow more complex types of experiments to be conducted with this model animal. We established a new antibiotic selection marker for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt;). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Streptothricin acetyl transferase 2 (&amp;lt;i&gt;Sat2&amp;lt;/i&gt;): A dominant selection marker for &amp;lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; genome editing</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Obinata, Asako Sugimoto, Shinsuke Niwa&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Hiroyuki Obinata</name></author><fingerprint>2f1c4bbd</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197128</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00330/20180507/images/medium/jm-2018-003309_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00330&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematopoietic malignancy originating from T-cell progenitors in which differentiation is blocked at early stages. Physiological expression of specific NKL homeobox genes obeys a hematopoietic NKL-code implicated in the process of lymphopoiesis while in differentiated T-cells these genes are silenced. We propose that this developmental expression pattern underlies the observation that NKL homeobox genes are the most ubiquitous group of transcription factors deregulated in T-ALL, including TLX1, TLX3, NKX2-5 and NKX3-1. Here, we describe a novel member of the NKL homeobox gene subclass, NKX3-2 (BAPX1), which is aberrantly activated in 18% of pediatric T-ALL patients analyzed while being normally expressed in developing spleen. Identification of NKX3-2 expression in T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM qualified these cells to model its deregulation and function in a leukemic context. Genomic and chromosomal analyses demonstrated normal configuration of the NKX3-2 locus at chromosome 4p15, thus excluding cytogenetic dysregulation. Comparative expression profiling analysis of NKX3-2 patient data revealed deregulated activity of BMP- and MAPK-signalling. These candidate pathways were experimentally confirmed to mediate aberrant NKX3-2 expression. We also show that homeobox gene SIX6, plus MIR17HG and GATA3 are downstream targets of NKX3-2 and plausibly contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignancy by suppressing T-cell differentiation. Finally, NKL homeobox gene NKX2-5 was activated by NKX3-2 in CCRF-CEM and by FOXG1 in PEER, representing mutually inhibitory activators of this translocated oncogene. Together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic NKL homeobox gene subclass member which is aberrantly expressed in a large subset of T-ALL patients and participates in a deregulated gene network likely to arise in developing spleen.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197194</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Aberrant activity of NKL homeobox gene NKX3-2 in a T-ALL subset</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Nagel, Corinna Meyer, Maren Kaufmann, Margarete Zaborski, Roderick A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197302</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Stopping the effective non-fluoroquinolone antibiotics at day 7 vs continuing until day 14 in adults with acute pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization: A randomized non-inferiority trial</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

This time difference reflects both the rarity of the event require to drive acidity and the extreme nature of some of the fluctuations.</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Is_Lewis_Acidity_in_Metal_Dications_Triggered_by_Solvent_Shell_Fluctuations_/6303710</link><title>Is Lewis Acidity in Metal Dications Triggered by Solvent Shell Fluctuations?</title><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Is_Lewis_Acidity_in_Metal_Dications_Triggered_by_Solvent_Shell_Fluctuations_/6303710</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>18</engagement><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cc3:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25392-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B_O1OmqRJLM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>57a2747f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25392-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/B_O1OmqRJLM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Observation of Magnetic Radial Vortex Nucleation in a Multilayer Stack with Tunable Anisotropy</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25392-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25392_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>448</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Vedat Karakas</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25392-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/B_O1OmqRJLM/s41598-018-25392-x</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543f:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197701</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emily R.

Establishing the tissue source of epithelial cells within a biological sample is an important capability for forensic laboratories. In this study we used Imaging Flow Cytometry (IFC) to analyze individual cells recovered from buccal, epidermal, and vaginal samples that had been dried between 24 hours and more than eight weeks. Measurements capturing the size, shape, and fluorescent properties of cells were collected in an automated manner and then used to build a multivariate statistical framework for differentiating cells based on tissue type. Results showed that epidermal cells could be distinguished from vaginal and buccal cells using a discriminant function analysis of IFC measurements with an average classification accuracy of ~94%. Ultimately, cellular measurements such as these, which can be obtained non-destructively, may provide probative information for many types of biological samples and complement results from standard genetic profiling techniques.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197701</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid differentiation of epithelial cell types in aged biological samples using autofluorescence and morphological signatures</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emily R.

Background &lt;p&gt;The production of high-quality guidelines in response to public health emergencies poses challenges for the World Health Organization (WHO). The urgent need for guidance and the paucity of structured scientific data on emerging diseases hinder the formulation of evidence-informed recommendations using standard methods and procedures.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In the context of the response to recent public health emergencies, this project aimed to describe the information products produced by WHO and assess the quality and trustworthiness of a subset of these products classified as guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We selected four recent infectious disease emergencies: outbreaks of avian influenza A—H1N1 virus (2009) and H7N9 virus (2013), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (2013), and Ebola virus disease (EVD) (2014 to 2016). We analyzed the development and publication processes and evaluated the quality of emergency guidelines using AGREE-II.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 175 information products of which 87 were guidelines. These products demonstrated variable adherence to WHO publication requirements including the listing of external contributors, management of declarations of interest, and entry into WHO’s public database of publications. For guidelines, the methods for development were incompletely reported; WHO’s quality assurance process was rarely used; systematic or other evidence reviews were infrequently referenced; external peer review was not performed; and they scored poorly with AGREE II, particularly for rigour of development and editorial independence.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study suggests that WHO guidelines produced in the context of a public health emergency can be improved upon, helping to assure the trustworthiness and utility of WHO information products in future emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198125</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>An evaluation of emergency guidelines issued by the World Health Organization in response to four infectious disease outbreaks</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan L.

To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage. Objective: Our primary goal was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting sepsis using streaming physiological data in real-time. Methods: A dataset consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1,161 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was analyzed in this IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study. Of that total, 634 patients were identified to have developed sepsis. In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset. Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</description><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>dcf66e2e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs.

Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</content></content><title>Physiomarkers in Real-Time Physiological Data Streams Predict Adult Sepsis Onset Earlier Than Clinical Practice [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>van Wyk, F.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/322305</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd85:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198139</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dennis R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;In the liver, a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH) is oxidative stress, which leads to the accumulation of highly reactive electrophilic α/β unsaturated aldehydes. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of NASH on protein carbonylation and antioxidant responses in a murine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Liver-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deletion mice (PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt;) or control littermates were fed a standard chow diet for 45–55 weeks followed by analysis for liver injury, oxidative stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Histology and Picrosirius red-staining of collagen deposition within the extracellular matrix revealed extensive steatosis and fibrosis in the PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice but no steatosis or fibrosis in controls. Increased steatosis and fibrosis corresponded with significant increases in inflammation. PTEN-deficient livers showed significantly increased cell-specific oxidative damage, as detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and acrolein staining. Elevated staining correlated with an increase in nuclear DNA repair foci (γH2A.X) and cellular proliferation index (Ki67) within zones 1 and 3, indicating oxidative damage was zonally restricted and was associated with increased DNA damage and cell proliferation. Immunoblots showed that total levels of antioxidant response proteins induced by nuclear factor erythroid-2-like-2 (Nrf2), including GSTμ, GSTπ and CBR1/3, but not HO-1, were elevated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to controls, and IHC showed this response also occurred only in zones 1 and 3. Furthermore, an analysis of autophagy markers revealed significant elevation of p62 and LC3II expression. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis identified significantly more carbonylated proteins in whole cell extracts prepared from PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; mice (966) as compared to controls (809). Pathway analyses of identified proteins did not uncover specific pathways that were preferentially carbonylated in PTEN&lt;sup&gt;LKO&lt;/sup&gt; livers but, did reveal specific strongly increased carbonylation of thioredoxin reductase and of glutathione-&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-transferases (GST) M6, O1, and O2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Results show that disruption of PTEN resulted in steatohepatitis, fibrosis and caused hepatic induction of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system at least in part due to elevation of p62. This response was both cell-type and zone specific.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) has become the tool of choice for genome editing. Despite the fact that it has evolved as a highly efficient means to edit/replace coding sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency for “clean” editing of non-coding DNA remains low. We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>DMSO increases efficiency of genome editing at two non-coding loci</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197440</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;P&amp;lt;/i&gt; values in display items are ubiquitous and almost invariably significant: A survey of top science journals</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

Recent evidence has shown the importance of both lncRNAs and chromatin interactions in transcriptional regulation. Although network-based methods, mainly exploiting gene-lncRNA co-expression, have been applied to characterize lncRNA of unknown function by means of &apos;guilt-by-association&apos; strategies, no method exists which combines co-expression analysis with 3D chromatin interaction data. Results: To better understand the function of chromatin interactions in the context of lncRNA-mediated gene regulation, we have developed a multi-step graph analysis approach to examine the RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET chromatin interaction network in the K562 human cell line. We have annotated the network with gene and lncRNA coordinates, and chromatin states from the ENCODE project. We used centrality measures, as well as an adaptation of our previously developed Markov State Models (MSM) clustering method, to gain a better understanding of lncRNAs in transcriptional regulation. The novelty of our approach resides into the detection of fuzzy regulatory modules based on network properties and their optimization based on co-expression analysis between genes and gene-lncRNA pairs. This results in our method returning more bona fide regulatory modules than other state-of-the art approaches for clustering on graphs. Conclusions: Interestingly, we find that lncRNA network hubs tend to be significantly enriched in disease association, positional conservation and enhancer-like functions. We validated regulatory functions for well known lncRNAs, such as MALAT1 and the enhancer-like lncRNA FALEC. In addition, by investigating the modular structure of bigger components we show that we can propose regulatory functional mechanisms for uncharacterized lncRNAs, such FLJ37453, RP11442N24 B.1 and LINC00910.</description><published>1527490800000</published><fingerprint>b9a5dd90</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331256v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Although several studies have provided insights into the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), the majority of them has unknown function.

In addition, by investigating the modular structure of bigger components we show that we can propose regulatory functional mechanisms for uncharacterized lncRNAs, such FLJ37453, RP11442N24 B.1 and LINC00910.</content></content><title>Identifying lncRNA-mediated regulatory modules via ChIA-PET network analysis [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Thiel, D.

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><fingerprint>9b9b4055</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</link><title>The complex ecosystem in non small cell lung cancer invasion</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><fingerprint>dd03e042</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</link><title>Bi-stability in cooperative transport by ants in the presence of obstacles</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy. In this work we propose a minimal model of BMU function which involves a small number of signals and accounts for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions are i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a reduced choice of decisions: divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) such decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor is coupled to that of a few external mediators. It is shown that efficient BMU operation then unfolds as an emergent property, which results from individual decisions taken by cells in the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning.</description><published>1525935600000</published><fingerprint>1e38c99f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318931v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling during the whole life.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198069</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Feasibility and outcomes of atrial fibrillation screening using intermittent electrocardiography in a primary healthcare setting: A cross-sectional study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Faris Ghazal, Holger Theobald, Mårten Rosenqvist, Faris Al-Khalili&lt;/p&gt;

In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Faris Ghazal</name></author><fingerprint>83e1e24a</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198069</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198069</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3d:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198309</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yunnan Hou, Keke Cheng, Zehua Li, Xiaohui Ma, Yahong Wei, Lei Zhang, Yao Wang&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198309</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Biosorption of Cadmium and Manganese Using Free Cells of &amp;lt;i&gt;Klebsiella&amp;lt;/i&gt; sp.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, our findings suggest that there is no clinical benefit in manually revising the ApneaLinkTM autoscore.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Screening for obstructive sleep apnea among hospital outpatients</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michel Hug, Katrin Uehli, Stig Solbach, Stefanie Brighenti-Zogg, Selina Dürr, Sabrina Maier, Jörg Daniel Leuppi, David Miedinger&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFβ-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFβ-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFβ-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFβ-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFβ-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties.

Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198169</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&quot;We call them miracle babies&quot;: How health care providers understand neonatal near-misses at three teaching hospitals in Ghana</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by April J.

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region. Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was applied to the intracellular side of excised membrane patches and the characteristics of the channel block were determined. We compared the kinetics of the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block when the channels were phosphorylated (inhibited) or dephosphorylated (activated) and also in different mutants mimicking the two functional states. Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>TRESK background potassium channel is not gated at the helix bundle crossing near the cytoplasmic end of the pore</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miklós Lengyel, Gábor Czirják, Péter Enyedi&lt;/p&gt;

Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK.</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Miklós Lengyel</name></author><fingerprint>d2ee7790</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>376</engagement><crawled>1525853617625</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16343f67dd9:94c879:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05089-x</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Write fiction to discover something new in your research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write fiction to discover something new in your research, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05089-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05089-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Creative writing can help you to approach your science from a completely different perspective — and boost its impact, says Amanda C.

Clinical data suggest that the neuroendocrine stress response is chronically dysregulated in a subset of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), potentially contributing to both disease progression and the development of psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. Whether neuroendocrine dysregulation and psychiatric comorbidities reflect direct effects of epilepsy-related pathologies, or secondary effects of disease burden particular to humans with epilepsy (i.e. social estrangement, employment changes) is not clear. Animal models provide an opportunity to dissociate these factors. Therefore, we queried whether epileptic mice would reproduce neuroendocrine and behavioral changes associated with human epilepsy. Male FVB mice were exposed to pilocarpine to induce status epilepticus (SE) and the subsequent development of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Morning baseline corticosterone levels were elevated in pilocarpine treated mice at 1, 7 and 10 weeks post-SE relative to controls. Similarly, epileptic mice had increased adrenal weight when compared to control mice. Exposure to acute restraint stress resulted in hypersecretion of corticosterone 30 min after the onset of the challenge. Anatomical analyses revealed reduced Fos expression in infralimbic and prelimbic prefrontal cortex, ventral subiculum and basal amygdala following restraint. No differences in Fos immunoreactivity were found in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampal subfields or central amygdala. In order to assess emotional behavior, a second cohort of mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests, including sucrose preference, open field, elevated plus maze, 24h home-cage monitoring and forced swim. Epileptic mice showed increased anhedonic behavior, hyperactivity and anxiety-like behaviors. Together these data demonstrate that epileptic mice develop HPA axis hyperactivity and exhibit behavioral dysfunction. Endocrine and behavioral changes are associated with impaired recruitment of forebrain circuits regulating stress inhibition and emotional reactivity. Loss of forebrain control may underlie pronounced endocrine dysfunction and comorbid psychopathologies seen in temporal lobe epilepsy.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197955</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Functional disruption of stress modulatory circuits in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aynara C.

This was the antibody-drug conjugate that they’d purchased from Stemcentryx – OK, let’s clarify that, they bought Stemcentryx out completely for nearly six billion dollars, largely to get their hands on this great new drug. As that March post says, though, the clinical results were deeply unimpressive. AbbVie stock took quite a hit on the news, even though there were already grounds for suspicion about just how the trial (TRINITY) would come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the company has done a more thorough presentation of the data at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, and if anything, it’s even worse than it appeared in March. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zbiotech/status/1003966802370682885&quot;&gt;@zbiotech on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is quoting a Leerink analysis (by Geoffrey Porges, I assume, who has been following this drug’s progress closely), and it’s not the tiniest bit encouraging. “&lt;em&gt;The results shown in the presentation were even worse than we had feared. . .we can’t help but regard the ongoing trials as largely fruitless exercises&lt;/em&gt;“. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem for AbbVie is that it’s the adverse events that are sinking Rova-T, and those may be built into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://investors.abbvie.com/news-releases/news-release-details/abbvie-expand-oncology-presence-through-acquisition-stemcentrx&quot;&gt;other programs&lt;/a&gt; that they bought from Stemcentryx, since these apparently use the same cytotoxic payload. At the very least, it casts a real shadow over things. Going back and reading that last link, the 2016 press release announcing the deal, is a grim experience. It’s all about how this is a multibillion dollar opportunity, expected commercialization in 2018, compelling data in the earlier trials, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s go back to that Leerink analysis: “&lt;em&gt;The TRINITY study provided yet another lesson in the perils of relying on single arm early trials without doing a randomized trial. . .&lt;/em&gt;” It certainly does that. Not everyone would have reached into their pocket for $5.8 billion on seeing the earlier Stemcentryx data (that figure on AbbVie), but you could have gotten a lot of people to agree that it looked promising. But “promising” or even “compelling” clinical data are only as solid as the clinical trials that generate them, and single-arm trials are just not solid enough to put that kind of money down on them with any real confidence. Sure, you’re going to win sometimes – but don’t pretend that you’re not gambling. And don’t get the idea that I’m speaking out against taking those kinds of risks in this business (sometimes you have to), but it would help to be a bit more honest about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth thinking about this situation in light of that &amp;lt;sarcasm&gt; amazing, life-saving Right to Try bill &amp;lt;/sarcasm&gt; that was just signed. This is exactly the sort of drug that comes under its purview. Early, early stage results, promising for a deadly disease. Give it to the poor desperate patients! But that’s no kindness: Rova-T turns out to be &lt;em&gt;worse than the standard of care&lt;/em&gt;. You are not only not helping lung cancer patients with it, you are objectively doing them harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what happens with the involvement of a huge, perfectly competent drug company that is willing to spend billions of dollars up front. What happens with smaller, shakier even-less-statistically powered approaches to deadly disease? Well, what do you think? And that doesn’t even take us to the bigger fear I have about the whole approach, that even worse outfits will configure themselves just to make money off the desperately ill, in completely legal fashion, without even bothering themselves about whether the &lt;del&gt;marks&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;customers&lt;/del&gt; patients have any chance of being helped or not. We’re not there yet, but we’ve opened the door to it. Haven’t we, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/06/01/the-fdas-latest-actions-and-problems&quot;&gt;Senator Johnson&lt;/a&gt;? There’s a man who apparently has no opinion whatsoever about the ability of the President to pardon himself – Hands in the air! Huge shrug! Who knows! – but he is &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; that the FDA needs to get out of the way so that people can take drugs like Rova-T.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><fingerprint>4585a5bf</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</link><title>Firing-rate based network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatiotemporal response properties of relay cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Milad Hobbi Mobarhan</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NEnghs1B4I8/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb911:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197708</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bernt Lindtjørn, Demissew Mitike, Zillo Zidda, Yaliso Yaya&lt;/p&gt;
Previous studies from South Ethiopia have shown that interventions that focus on intrapartum care substantially reduce maternal mortality and there is a need to operationalize health packages that could reduce stillbirths. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if a programme that aimed to improve maternal health, and mainly focusing on strengthening intrapartum care, also would reduce the number of stillbirths, and to estimate if there are other indicators that explains high stillbirth rates. Our study used a “continuum of care” approach and focussed on providing essential antenatal and obstetric services in communities through health extension workers, at antenatal and health facility services. In this follow up study, which includes the same 38.312 births registered by community health workers, shows that interventions focusing on improved intrapartum care can also reduce stillbirths (by 46%; from 14.5 to 7.8 per 1000 births). Other risk factors for stillbirths are mainly related to complications during delivery and illnesses during pregnancy. We show that focusing on Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care and antenatal services reduces stillbirths. However, the study also underlines that illnesses during pregnancy and complications during delivery still represent the main risk factors for stillbirths. This indicates that obstetric care need still to be strengthened, should include the continuum of care from home to the health facility, make care accessible to all, and reduce delays.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197708</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Reducing stillbirths in Ethiopia: Results of an intervention programme</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bernt Lindtjørn, Demissew Mitike, Zillo Zidda, Yaliso Yaya&lt;/p&gt;

However, in many cancers, epigenomic analyses have been limited, and computational methods to infer regulatory networks in tumors typically use expression data alone, or rely on transcription factor (TF) motifs in annotated promoter regions. Here, we develop a novel machine learning strategy called PSIONIC (patient-specific inference of networks informed by chromatin) to combine cell line chromatin accessibility data with large tumor expression data sets and model the effect of enhancers on transcriptional programs in multiple cancers. We generated a new ATAC-seq data set profiling chromatin accessibility in gynecologic and basal breast cancer cell lines and applied PSIONIC to 723 RNA-seq experiments from ovarian, uterine, and basal breast tumors as well as 96 cell line RNA-seq profiles. Our computational framework enables us to share information across tumors to learn patient-specific inferred TF activities, revealing regulatory differences between and within tumor types. Many of the identified TF regulators were significantly associated with survival outcome in basal breast, uterine serous and endometrioid carcinomas. Moreover, PSIONIC-predicted activity for MTF1 in cell line models correlated with sensitivity to MTF1 inhibition. Therefore computationally dissecting the role of TFs in gynecologic cancers may ultimately advance personalized therapy.</description><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>e8808867</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333757v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Epigenomic data on transcription factor occupancy and chromatin accessibility can elucidate the developmental origin of cancer cells and reveal the enhancer landscape of key oncogenic transcriptional regulators. However, in many cancers, epigenomic analyses have been limited, and computational methods to infer regulatory networks in tumors typically use expression data alone, or rely on transcription factor (TF) motifs in annotated promoter regions. Here, we develop a novel machine learning strategy called PSIONIC (patient-specific inference of networks informed by chromatin) to combine cell line chromatin accessibility data with large tumor expression data sets and model the effect of enhancers on transcriptional programs in multiple cancers. We generated a new ATAC-seq data set profiling chromatin accessibility in gynecologic and basal breast cancer cell lines and applied PSIONIC to 723 RNA-seq experiments from ovarian, uterine, and basal breast tumors as well as 96 cell line RNA-seq profiles.

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><fingerprint>3268a71e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</link><title>Logistical constraints lead to an intermediate optimum in outbreak response vaccination</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yun Tao, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari&lt;/p&gt;

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness. Accordingly, multidimensional frameworks of observable behaviors relevant to resuscitation teams are needed to understand more deeply the nature of team SA, its implications for team effectiveness, and whether it can be trained. A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196825</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A taxonomy and rating system to measure situation awareness in resuscitation teams</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas A.

Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Thomas A.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) were used to evaluate trophic niche overlap between two filter-feeding fishes (known together as bigheaded carp) native to China, silver carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&lt;/i&gt;) and bighead carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys nobilis&lt;/i&gt;), and three native filter-feeding fish including bigmouth buffalo (&lt;i&gt;Ictiobus cyprinellus&lt;/i&gt;), gizzard shad (&lt;i&gt;Dorosoma cepedianum&lt;/i&gt;) and paddlefish (&lt;i&gt;Polyodon spathula&lt;/i&gt;) in the lower Missouri River, USA, using the Bayesian Stable Isotope in R statistics. Results indicate that except for bigmouth buffalo, all species displayed similar trophic niche size and trophic diversity. Bigmouth buffalo occupied a small trophic niche and had the greatest trophic overlap with silver carp (93.6%) and bighead carp (94.1%) followed by gizzard shad (91.0%). Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish. Average niche overlap between silver carp and native species was as high as 71%, greater than niche overlap between bighead carp and native fish (64%). Our findings indicate that bigheaded carps are a potential threat to a diverse and stable native fish community.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197584</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Isotope niche dimension and trophic overlap between bigheaded carps and native filter-feeding fish in the lower Missouri River, USA</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianzhu Wang, Duane Chapman, Jun Xu, Yang Wang, Binhe Gu&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess whether embryonic DNA isolated from blastocyst culture conditioned medium (BCCM) combined with blastocoel fluid (BF) could be used for blastocyst stage non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening, NIPGS).&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;47 embryos from 35 patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; Interventions &lt;p&gt;DNA analysis of combined BCCM plus BF in comparison with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and/or whole blastocyst (WB)using next generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Embryonic DNA was successfully amplified in 47/47 NIPGS samples (28 frozen-thawed and 19 fresh culture samples) ranging from 6.3 to 44.0 ng/μl. For frozen-thawed embryos, the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample was equivalent between NIPGS vs. TE biopsy, NIPGS vs. WB and TE vs. WB samples taken from the same embryo was 87.5%; 96.4% and 91.7% respectively (P&gt;0.05), and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 99.3%, 99.7% and 99.7%, respectively (P&gt;0.05). In fresh cases (Day 4 to Day 5/6 culture), the concordance rate for whole chromosome copy number per sample between NIPGS vs. TE samples taken from the same embryo was 100%, and the rate of concordance per single chromosome was 98.2% (P&gt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A combination of BCCM and BF contains sufficient embryonic DNA for whole genome amplification and accurate aneuploidy screening.

Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and membrane potential changes. We found that sulfated Myc- as well as Nod-LCOs initiate a membrane depolarization, which depends on the chemical composition of these signaling molecules, as well as the genotype of the plants that were studied. A successive application of sulfated Myc-LCOs and Nod-LCOs resulted only in a single transient depolarization, indicating that Myc-LCOs can repress plasma membrane responses to Nod-LCOs. In contrast to current models, the Nod-LCO-induced depolarization precedes changes in the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level of root hair cells. The Nod-LCO induced membrane depolarization thus is most likely independent of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and nuclear Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spiking.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198126</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mycorrhizal lipochitinoligosaccharides (LCOs) depolarize root hairs of &amp;lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna-Lena Hürter, Sébastien Fort, Sylvain Cottaz, Rainer Hedrich, Dietmar Geiger, M.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although determining the quality of life among glaucoma patients has important clinical and public health implications, the utility value of glaucoma patients has not yet been determined in Korea.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database was used to identify 833 glaucoma patients based on ophthalmologic examinations. The adjusted mean utility values, calculated by EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L), of glaucoma patients according to patient demographics and measures of glaucoma severity were determined using multivariate linear regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean utility value of glaucoma patients was 0.8968. Patients aged 70 years or more had significantly lower utility value (0.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value 0.005) compared to those aged less than 50 years (0.96). Patients within the lowest quartile of income had a utility value of 0.87, compared to a utility value of 0.96 for those within the highest quartile (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value 0.001). Patients who were not married had lower utility value (0.87) compared to married patients (0.93). Patients within the lowest quartile of worse eye frequency doubling technology (FDT) score had lower utility value (0.88) compared to those within the highest quartile (0.94). Finally, bilateral vision loss patients had significantly lower utility value (0.83, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value 0.013) compared to patients without vision loss (0.92).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The present study assessed utility values of Korean glaucoma patients.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH. Consistently funded interventions included testing, partner services and linkage to care and interventions for men who have sex with men (MSM). Sensitivity analyses showed that the optimal allocation shifted when there were differences in transmission category proportions and progress along the HIV care continuum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The robustness of the results suggests that most health departments can use these analyses to guide the investment of CDC HIV prevention funds into strategies to prevent the most new cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197421</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optimal allocation of HIV prevention funds for state health departments</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emine Yaylali, Paul G.

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Behavior and physiology of two different sow breeds in a farrowing environment during late 35-day lactation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>DNA methylation of hepatic iron sensing genes and the regulation of hepcidin expression</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

We analyzed an additional 25 rosmarinic acid derivatives, and found that 5 also inhibited ε-Pol. Structural comparisons between these derivatives implied that the “two phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends” and the “caffeic acid-like structure” of rosmarinic acid are critical for the inhibition of ε-Pol binding.

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only.

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Corey L.

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Growth medium-dependent antimicrobial activity of early stage MEP pathway inhibitors</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Sara Sanders</name></author><fingerprint>5f110ba6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761226:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197434</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elise Braekman, Finaba Berete, Rana Charafeddine, Stefaan Demarest, Sabine Drieskens, Lydia Gisle, Geert Molenberghs, Jean Tafforeau, Johan Van der Heyden, Guido Van Hal&lt;/p&gt;
Before organizing mixed-mode data collection for the self-administered questionnaire of the Belgian Health Interview Survey, measurement effects between the paper-and-pencil and the web-based questionnaire were evaluated. A two-period cross-over study was organized with a sample of 149 employees of two Belgian research institutes (age range 22–62 years, 72% female). Measurement agreement was assessed for a diverse range of health indicators related to general health, mental and psychosocial health, health behaviors and prevention with kappa coefficients and intraclass correlation (ICC). The quality of the data collected by both modes was evaluated by quantifying the missing, ‘don’t know’ and inconsistent values and data entry mistakes. Good to very good agreement was found for all categorical indicators with kappa coefficients superior to 0.60, except for two mental and psychosocial health indicators namely the presence of a sleeping disorder and of a depressive disorder (kappa≥0.50). For the continuous indicators high to acceptable agreement was observed with ICC superior to 0.70. Inconsistent answers and data-entry mistakes were only occurring in the paper-and-pencil mode. There were no less missing values in the web-based mode compared to the paper-and-pencil mode. The study supports the idea that web-based modes provide, in general, equal responses to paper-and-pencil modes. However, health indicators based upon factual and objective items tend to have higher measurement agreement than indicators requiring an assessment of personal subjective feelings. A web-based mode greatly facilitates the data-entry process and guides the completing of a questionnaire. However, item non-response was not positively affected.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197434</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Measurement agreement of the self-administered questionnaire of the Belgian Health Interview Survey: Paper-and-pencil versus web-based mode</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elise Braekman, Finaba Berete, Rana Charafeddine, Stefaan Demarest, Sabine Drieskens, Lydia Gisle, Geert Molenberghs, Jean Tafforeau, Johan Van der Heyden, Guido Van Hal&lt;/p&gt;

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197110</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Germination fitness of two temperate epiphytic ferns shifts under increasing temperatures and forest fragmentation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>High throughput nonparametric probability density estimation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Jenny Farmer</name></author><fingerprint>7c17d2c4</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>5</engagement><crawled>1526918281250</crawled><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_163836bf822:66b40be:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0157-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond the maternal epigenetic legacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the maternal epigenetic legacy, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0157-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0157-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In 2004, Weaver et al. published evidence in Nature Neuroscience for the lasting epigenetic impact of maternal care within the hippocampus of rat offspring.

Diseases where complicated pathophysiology evolves over time are excellent targets for such methods. One such disease is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease, where the drug survival at 5-years is less than 50% for patients treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methods and Findings We have developed a network-based approach for drug repositioning that takes into account the human interactome network, proximity measures between drug targets and disease-associated genes, potential side-effects, genome-wide gene expression and disease modules that emerge through pertinent analysis. We found that all DMARDs, except for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), were found to be significantly proximal to RA-related genes. Application of the method on anti-diabetic agents, statins and H2 receptor blockers identified anti-diabetic agents - gliclazide, sitagliptin and metformin - that have similar network signatures with the DMARDs. Subsequent in-vitro experiments on mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells validated the findings and the down regulation of six key RA-related inflammatory genes. Our analysis further argues that the combination of HCQ and/or sulfasalazine with methotrexate (MTX) is predicted to have an additive synergistic effect in treatment based on network complementarity. Similarly, leflunomide and tofacitinib were found to be suitable alternatives upon chemoresistance to MTX-based double/triple therapy, given the complementary network signatures and overlapping critical target hubs.

The results suggest massive AS regulation in the brain that is also likely important for circadian regulation.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>Striking circadian neuron diversity and cycling of Drosophila alternative splicing</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>katea@brandeis.edu (Donald C Rio)</name></author><fingerprint>3412a6e6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35618</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35618</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42275:5785ab88</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197203</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Joshua Amo-Adjei, Kofi Aduo-Adjei, Christiana Opoku-Nyamaah, Chimaraoke Izugbara&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197203</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Analysis of socioeconomic differences in the quality of antenatal services in low and middle-income countries (LMICs)</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joshua Amo-Adjei, Kofi Aduo-Adjei, Christiana Opoku-Nyamaah, Chimaraoke Izugbara&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Joshua Amo-Adjei</name></author><fingerprint>9eb1ef23</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197203</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197203</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>467</engagement><crawled>1527772259020</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b652a2cc:303c51c:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05308-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Million-dollar Kavli prize recognizes scientist scooped on CRISPR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Million-dollar Kavli prize recognizes scientist scooped on CRISPR, Published online: 31 May 2018;

In this study, we investigated the relationship between propofol and autophagy and examined whether this relationship depends on ER stress, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and disruption of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis. To this end, we measured C2C12 cell apoptosis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, along with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels; ROS production; and expression of proteins and genes associated with autophagy, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and ER stress, including LC3 (microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3), p62, AMPK (adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), phosphorylated mTOR, CHOP (C/BEP homologous protein), and Grp78/Bip (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). We found that propofol treatment induced autophagy, ER stress, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. The ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to AMPK increased, whereas the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR to mTOR decreased. Collectively, the data suggested that propofol induced autophagy &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through ER stress, resulting in elevated ROS and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, co-administration of an ER stress inhibitor blunted the effect of propofol.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Propofol elicits autophagy via endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium exchange in C2C12 myoblast cell line</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xi Chen, Long-Yun Li, Jin-Lan Jiang, Kai Li, Zhen-Bo Su, Fu-Qiang Zhang, Wen-Jing Zhang, Guo-Qing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

To ease the development and analysis of logical models, a series of software tools have been proposed, often with specific assets.

In this respect, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a joint distribution of several logical modelling software tools, along with an interactive web Python interface easing the chaining of complementary analyses. In this protocol, we demonstrate the assets of this approach through the analysis of a computational model of biological network. Our computational workflow combines (1) the importation of a GINsim model and its display, (2) its format conversion using the Java library BioLQM, (3) the formal prediction of mutations using the OCaml software Pint, (4) the model checking using the C++ software NuSMV, (5) quantitative stochastic simulations using the C++ software MaBoSS, and (6) the visualisation of results using the Python library matplotlib. We rely on the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook to provide a thoroughly documented and executable notebook of our computational analysis. Starting with a recent Boolean model of the signalling network controlling tumour cell invasion and migration, our model analysis culminates with the prediction of sets of mutations presumably involved in a metastatic phenotype. Beyond the specific application considered here, the resulting Jupyter notebook constitutes a tutorial for the use and combination of several logical modelling tools, which can be easily adapted to analyse other models.

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids.

The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%).

The study of plant remains in archaeological sites, along with a better understanding of the use of plants by prehistoric populations, can help us shed light on changes in survival strategies of hunter-gatherers and consequent impacts on modern human cognition, social organization, and technology. The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths—amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants—as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5–6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa. We suggest that humans inhabiting Pinnacle Point during short-term occupation events during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 built fast fires using mainly grasses with some wood from trees and/or shrubs for specific purposes, perhaps for shellfish cooking. With the onset of MIS 4 we observed a change in the plant gathering strategies towards the intentional and intensive exploitation of dry wood to improve, we hypothesise, combustion for heating silcrete. This human behaviour is associated with changes in stone tool technology, site occupation intensity and climate change.</description><published>1528146000000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Phytoliths as an indicator of early modern humans plant gathering strategies, fire fuel and site occupation intensity during the Middle Stone Age at Pinnacle Point 5-6 (south coast, South Africa)</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Irene Esteban, Curtis W.

The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths—amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants—as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5–6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa. We suggest that humans inhabiting Pinnacle Point during short-term occupation events during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 built fast fires using mainly grasses with some wood from trees and/or shrubs for specific purposes, perhaps for shellfish cooking. With the onset of MIS 4 we observed a change in the plant gathering strategies towards the intentional and intensive exploitation of dry wood to improve, we hypothesise, combustion for heating silcrete. This human behaviour is associated with changes in stone tool technology, site occupation intensity and climate change.</content></content><updated>1528146000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Irene Esteban</name></author><fingerprint>1fd5483d</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198558</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198558</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>375</engagement><crawled>1526376496351</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1636320fcdf:3602ec1:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04268-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diffusion markers of dendritic density and arborization in gray matter predict differences in intelligence&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diffusion markers of dendritic density and arborization in gray matter predict differences in intelligence, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04268-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04268-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Previous studies suggest that individual differences in intelligence correlate with circuit complexity and dendritic arborization in the brain.

&lt;i&gt;Lactococcus lactis&lt;/i&gt; is an ovoid bacterium that forms filaments during planktonic and biofilm lifestyles by uncoupling cell division from cell elongation. In this work, we investigate the role of the leading peptidoglycan synthase PBP2b that is dedicated to cell elongation in ovococci. We show that the localization of a fluorescent derivative of PBP2b remains associated to the septal region and superimposed with structural changes of FtsZ during both vegetative growth and filamentation indicating that PBP2b remains intimately associated to the division machinery during the whole cell cycle.

This septation defect does not simply result from the absence of the protein in the cell growth machinery since it is also observed when PBP2b-deficient cells are complemented by a catalytically inactive variant of PBP2b. Finally, we show that round cells resulting from β-lactam treatment are not altered in septation, suggesting that shape elongation as such is not a major determinant for selection of the division site.

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>A New Method to Weigh Biomolecules</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>ff33f6dc</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/10/a-new-method-to-weigh-biomolecules</href></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13526</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527009159129</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef72:3dd877af</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5594.short?rss=1</originId><description>Glutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action.

Mitotane is the reference drug for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and the metabolic activation of the drug is considered as essential for its activity. The aim of this study was to assess the role of CYP11B1 on mitotane action and metabolism in H295R ACC cells to understand whether this enzyme may influence mitotane action. The simultaneous incubation with mitotane and metyrapone, an adrenolytic molecule targeting 11-beta-hydroxylase, did not influence mitotane-mediated cytotoxic effect and metabolism in H295R ACC cells. CYP11B1 silencing confirmed the lack of a significant metyrapone effect on mitotane action. The present findings do not support the view that CYP11B1 catalyzes a crucial step in the metabolic activation of mitotane and that CYP11B1 confers the adrenal specificity to mitotane.</content></content><updated>1525726800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Antonina Germano</name></author><fingerprint>d4fc4c7a</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196931</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196931</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406e:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197810</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Swift, Jordan B.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory.

RNAi-based shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9-based sgRNA have been commonly utilized in functional genetic screens to identify essential genes affecting growth rates in cancer cell lines. However, questions remain whether the gene essentiality profiles determined using these two technologies are comparable. In the present study, we collected 42 cell lines representing a variety of 10 tissue types, which had been screened both by shRNA and CRISPR techniques. We observed poor consistency of the essentiality scores between the two screens for the majority of the cell lines. The consistency did not improve after correcting the off-target effects in the shRNA screening, suggesting a minimal impact of off-target effects. We considered a linear regression model where the shRNA essentiality score is the predictor and the CRISPR essentiality score is the response variable. We showed that by including molecular features such as mutation, gene expression and copy number variation as covariates, the predictability of the regression model greatly improved, suggesting that molecular features may provide critical information in explaining the discrepancy between the shRNA and CRISPR-based essentiality scores. We provided a Combined Essentiality Score (CES) based on the model prediction and showed that the CES greatly improved the consensus of common essential genes. Furthermore, the CES also identified novel essential genes that are specific to individual cell types. Taken together, we provided a systematic approach to define a more accurate gene essentiality profile by integrating functional screen data and molecular profiles.</description><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>897b2310</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322883v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Probing the genetic dependencies of cancer cells helps understand the tumor biology and identify potential drug targets.

ECF-CbrT is unrelated to the well-characterized B12 transporter BtuCDF, but their biochemical features indicate functional convergence.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><title>Functional and structural characterization of an ECF-type ABC transporter for vitamin B12</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>a.guskov@rug.nl (Albert Guskov)</name></author><fingerprint>785e2dbd</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35828</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35828</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42261:5785ab88</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196950</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sara A.

Safe and efficacious orally-delivered mucosal vaccine platforms are desperately needed to combat the plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species- and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gasseri&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCK1785), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants—NCK2025 and NCK2031—elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1β in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; mucosal vaccine platform.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196950</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Nod2&amp;lt;/i&gt; is required for antigen-specific humoral responses against antigens orally delivered using a recombinant &amp;lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&amp;lt;/i&gt; vaccine platform</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara A.

It is difficult to target and kill cancer cells. One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198157</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A repetitive mutation and selection system for bacterial evolution to increase the specific affinity to pancreatic cancer cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Osawa&lt;/p&gt;

Background/Aims &lt;p&gt;Typical approach for increasing apheresis platelet collections is to recruit new donors. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of an alternative strategy: optimizing donor scheduling, prior to recruitment, at a hospital-based blood donor center.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Analysis of collections, during the 89 consecutive months since opening of donor center, was performed. Linear regression and segmented time-series analyses were performed to calculate growth rates of collections and to test for statistical differences, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pre-intervention donor scheduling capacity was 39/month. In the absence of active donor recruitment, during the first 29 months, the number of collections rose gradually to 24/month (growth-rate of 0.70/month). However, between month-30 and -55, collections exhibited a plateau at 25.6 ± 3.0 (growth-rate of -0.09/month) (p&amp;lt;0.0001). This plateau-phase coincided with donor schedule approaching saturation (65.6 ± 7.6% schedule booked). Scheduling capacity was increased by following two interventions: adding an apheresis instrument (month-56) and adding two more collection days/week (month-72). Consequently, the scheduling capacity increased to 130/month. Post-interventions, apheresis platelet collections between month-56 and -81 exhibited a spontaneous renewed growth at a rate of 0.62/month (p&amp;lt;0.0001), in absence of active donor recruitment. Active donor recruitment in month-82 and -86, when the donor schedule had been optimized to accommodate further growth, resulted in a dramatic but transient surge in collections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Apheresis platelet collections plateau at nearly 2/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of the scheduling capacity. Optimizing the scheduling capacity prior to active donor recruitment is an effective strategy to increase platelet collections at a hospital-based donor center.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198062</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optimizing donor scheduling before recruitment: An effective approach to increasing apheresis platelet collections</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Parvez M.

Linear regression and segmented time-series analyses were performed to calculate growth rates of collections and to test for statistical differences, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pre-intervention donor scheduling capacity was 39/month. In the absence of active donor recruitment, during the first 29 months, the number of collections rose gradually to 24/month (growth-rate of 0.70/month). However, between month-30 and -55, collections exhibited a plateau at 25.6 ± 3.0 (growth-rate of -0.09/month) (p&amp;lt;0.0001). This plateau-phase coincided with donor schedule approaching saturation (65.6 ± 7.6% schedule booked). Scheduling capacity was increased by following two interventions: adding an apheresis instrument (month-56) and adding two more collection days/week (month-72). Consequently, the scheduling capacity increased to 130/month. Post-interventions, apheresis platelet collections between month-56 and -81 exhibited a spontaneous renewed growth at a rate of 0.62/month (p&amp;lt;0.0001), in absence of active donor recruitment. Active donor recruitment in month-82 and -86, when the donor schedule had been optimized to accommodate further growth, resulted in a dramatic but transient surge in collections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Apheresis platelet collections plateau at nearly 2/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of the scheduling capacity. Optimizing the scheduling capacity prior to active donor recruitment is an effective strategy to increase platelet collections at a hospital-based donor center.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Parvez M.

&lt;p&gt;A general situation in the field is when you have a big pile of RNA or DNA pieces, and you want to analyze them – sort them out, determine how many different ones are in there and which ones are present more than the others. This is the underlying problem that “RNA-seq” assays are trying to answer: when you perturb some cells by changing something about their environment, what genes’ transcriptions get affected? What protein levels go up or down? One reasonable proxy for those is the levels of various mRNAs, but there’s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of RNA in a cell, and sorting through it looking for changes has been nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some steps that a lot of these assays use to clean up the sample and get it into a form that can be more easily analyzed. The clean-up often involves some method to get all the ribosomal RNA out of there or to direct your readout away from it somehow, because that’s the majority of the RNA in cell lysate, and you don’t want your assay technology chasing it. Then there’s usually a fragmentation step, to break up the mRNAs into useful-sized pieces (which will be reassembled later on, computationally). Another common step is the use of reverse transcriptase enzymes to make complementary DNA out of all those mRNA pieces, because our techniques to amplify and sequence DNA are so flippin’ powerful. There’s often a step that tries to stick some sort of unique tag/label/identifier onto each DNA piece as well, using ligase enzymes, to aid in keeping track of all this stuff. These enzymes are the key to the whole business, along with modern sequencer technology and its associated computing prowess to reassemble everything from the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickSeq&quot;&gt;“Click-seq” variant&lt;/a&gt; works, though. You take your pile of mRNAs and expose them to reverse transcriptase, as before. But this time, you feed in a set amount of azide-containing nucleotides along with the usual mix of normal 2-deoxynucleotides to make your complementary DNAs. The thing is, these are chain-terminating residues for the RT enzyme, so what you end up with is a random heap of cDNA pieces, all of which end (on the 3′) with an azidonucleotide. And these turn into handles for introducing those labels/barcodes/identifiers. This way you avoid having to do a separate fragmentation step, because the reverse transcriptase has already fragmented things for you as it randomly choked on the azidonucleotides. And you avoid having to use the ligase enzymes to label everything, which can be expensive – you put those on via azide/alkyne reactions instead. The clicked oligos are still viable for PCR and sequencing, as it turns out, so that part of the process works fine, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7514-3_6&quot;&gt;the whole thing&lt;/a&gt; avoids some recombination artifacts that the other variants can be vulnerable to (ligases ligating the wrong things, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it’s also good for picking up real recombination events that might be biologically relevant, but rare on the absolute scale. This happens with some viruses, and the technique &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006365&quot;&gt;has been used&lt;/a&gt; to look at so-called “defective interfering” RNAs which emerge over time in viral infections. These are somewhat mysterious – in some cases, they seem to hijack and (as the name says) perhaps interfere with the usual infectious cycle, but they may also prolong it and make it worse. It looks like some viruses have evolved to let these things accumulate, and there must be a reason for that, too. The only way to unravel all that is with a good enough RNA analysis technique, and the clicked nucleotides just may be providing one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Clicked DNA: From Lab Curiosity to Analytical Technique</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>41cc32b5</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/21/clicked-dna-from-lab-curiosity-to-analytical-technique</href></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13553</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094061:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;
Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a generalist mining bee, &lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&lt;/i&gt;, that forages and reproduces during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; was explained by the interaction between flower density in the grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cineraria&lt;/i&gt; abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators. Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed rape resources.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197684</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Current and previous spatial distributions of oilseed rape fields influence the abundance and the body size of a solitary wild bee, &amp;lt;i&gt;Andrena cineraria&amp;lt;/i&gt;, in permanent grasslands</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin Van Reeth, Gaël Caro, Christian Bockstaller, Nadia Michel&lt;/p&gt;

Anaemia is a condition in which the haemoglobin concentration falls below an established cut-off value due to a decrease in the number and size of red blood cells. The current study aimed (i) to assess the spatial pattern and (ii) to identify determinants related to anaemia using the third Ethiopian demographic health survey. To achieve these objectives, this study took into account the sampling weight and the clustered nature of the data. As a result, multilevel modeling has been used in the statistical analysis. The analysis included complete cases from 15,909 females, and 13,903 males. Among all subjects who agreed for hemeoglobin test, 5.22% males, and 16.60% females were anemic. In both binary and ordinal outcome modeling approaches, educational level, age, wealth index, BMI and HIV status were found to be significant predictors of anaemia prevalence. Furthermore, this study applied spatial methods to generate maps at regional level which could be useful for policy makers where great efforts should be concentrated to reduce the prevalence of anaemia. As revealed by Moran’s &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; test, significant spatial autocorrelation were noted across clusters. The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Spatial pattern and determinants of anaemia in Ethiopia</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu, Eshetu Wencheko, Kiros Berhane&lt;/p&gt;

The risk of anaemia was found to vary across different regions, and higher prevalences were observed in Somali and Affar regions.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Bedilu Alamirie Ejigu</name></author><fingerprint>b9ff74f8</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197171</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>73</engagement><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce965:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/845?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/845.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Physics, Applied, Engineering</item></keywords><title>Basic instincts</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Hutson, M.</name></author><fingerprint>289d5b69</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/845?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/845?rss=1</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Harnessing new molecular design principles toward functional applications of ion-containing macromolecules relies on diversifying experimental datasets of well-understood materials.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194323</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Defending one&apos;s friends, not one&apos;s enemies: A social network analysis of children&apos;s defending, friendship, and dislike relationships using XPNet</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

This means of surveillances allows the immune system to detect peptides derives from bacterial, viral, and even oncologic sources. However, given the breadth of the epitope repertoire, in order to study immune responses to these epitopes, investigators have relied on in-silico prediction algorithms to help narrow down the list of candidate epitopes, and current methods still have much in the way of improvement. Results: We present Allele-Integrated MHC (AI-MHC), a deep learning architecture with improved performance over the current state-of-the-art algorithms in human Class I and Class II MHC binding prediction. Our architecture utilizes a convolutional neural network that improves prediction accuracy by 1) allowing one neural network to be trained on all peptides for all alleles of a given class of MHC molecules by making the allele an input to the net and 2) introducing a global max pooling operation with an optimized kernel size that allows the architecture to achieve translational invariance in MHC-peptide binding analysis, making it suitable for sequence analytics where a frame of interest needs to be learned in a longer, variable length sequence. We assess AI-MHC against internal independent test sets and compare against all algorithms in the IEDB automated server benchmarks, demonstrating our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art for both Class I and Class II prediction.

Background &lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle adversely affect multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Few multimodal behavioural interventions have been conducted for people with MS, and follow-up beyond 1 year is rare for lifestyle interventions. This study assessed adoption and adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes 3 years after a lifestyle modification intervention, using generalized estimating equation models to account for within-participant correlation over time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;95 people with MS completed baseline surveys before participating in 5-day MS lifestyle risk-factor modification workshops. 76 and 78 participants completed the 1-year and 3-year follow-up surveys respectively. Mean age at 3-year follow-up was 47 years, 72% were female, most (62.8%) had MS for 5 years or less, and 73% had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful increases in physical (mean difference (MD): 8.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.2–10.8) and mental health (MD: 9.2, CI: 5.8–12.6) quality of life (QOL) at 1-year, and physical (MD: 8.7, CI: 5.3–12.2) and mental health (MD: 8.0, CI: 4.2–11.8) QOL at 3-year follow-up. There was a small decrease in disability from baseline to 1-year follow-up (MD: 0.9, CI: 0.9,1.0) and to 3-year follow-up (MD: 1.0, CI: 0.9,1.0), which was not clinically meaningful. Of those with RRMS, compared to baseline, fewer had a relapse during the year before 1-year follow-up (OR: 0.1, CI 0.0–0.2) and 3-year follow-up (OR: 0.15, CI 0.06–0.33). Participants’ healthy diet score, the proportion meditating ≥1 hours a week, supplementing with ≥ 5000IU vitamin D daily, and supplementing with omega-3 flaxseed oil increased at 1-year follow-up and was sustained, although slightly lower at 3-year follow-up. However, there was no evidence for a change in physical activity and not enough smokers to make meaningful comparisons. Medication use increased at 1-year follow-up and at 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that lifestyle risk factor modification is feasible and sustainable over time, in a small self-selected and motivated sample of people with MS. Furthermore, participation in a lifestyle intervention is not associated with a decrease in MS medication use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197759</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Health outcomes and adherence to a healthy lifestyle after a multimodal intervention in people with multiple sclerosis: Three year follow-up</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Radiation pneumonitis is a common and serious complication of radiotherapy. Many published randomized controlled studies (RCTs) reveal a growing trend of using herbal medicines as adjuvant therapy to prevent radiation pneumonitis; however, their efficacy and safety remain unexplored.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines as adjunctive therapy for the prevention of radiation pneumonitis in patients with lung cancer who undergo radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched the following 11 databases: three English medical databases [MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)], five Korean medical databases (Korean Studies Information, Research information Service System, KoreaMed, DBPIA, National Digital Science Library), and three Chinese medical databases [the China National Knowledge Database (CNKI), Journal Integration Platform (VIP), and WanFang Database]. The primary outcome was the incidence of radiation pneumonitis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two RCTs involving 1819 participants were included. The methodological quality was poor for most of the studies. Meta-analysis showed that herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy significantly reduced the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (n = 1819; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45–0.63, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8%) and the incidence of severe radiation pneumonitis (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 903; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.41, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Combined therapy also improved the Karnofsky performance score (n = 420; WMD 4.62, 95% CI 1.05–8.18, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 82%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is some encouraging evidence that oral administration of herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy may benefit patients with lung cancer by preventing or minimizing radiation pneumonitis. However, due to the poor methodological quality of the identified studies, definitive conclusion could not be drawn.

Many published randomized controlled studies (RCTs) reveal a growing trend of using herbal medicines as adjuvant therapy to prevent radiation pneumonitis; however, their efficacy and safety remain unexplored.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines as adjunctive therapy for the prevention of radiation pneumonitis in patients with lung cancer who undergo radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched the following 11 databases: three English medical databases [MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)], five Korean medical databases (Korean Studies Information, Research information Service System, KoreaMed, DBPIA, National Digital Science Library), and three Chinese medical databases [the China National Knowledge Database (CNKI), Journal Integration Platform (VIP), and WanFang Database]. The primary outcome was the incidence of radiation pneumonitis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two RCTs involving 1819 participants were included. The methodological quality was poor for most of the studies. Meta-analysis showed that herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy significantly reduced the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (n = 1819; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.45–0.63, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8%) and the incidence of severe radiation pneumonitis (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 903; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.11–0.41, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). Combined therapy also improved the Karnofsky performance score (n = 420; WMD 4.62, 95% CI 1.05–8.18, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 82%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;There is some encouraging evidence that oral administration of herbal medicines combined with radiotherapy may benefit patients with lung cancer by preventing or minimizing radiation pneumonitis. However, due to the poor methodological quality of the identified studies, definitive conclusion could not be drawn. To confirm the merits of this approach, further rigorously designed large scale trials are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Kwan-Il Kim</name></author><fingerprint>74e051e9</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198015</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198015</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528220492204</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_163d10a21ac:5714dfa:2835af05</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5878.short?rss=1</originId><description>Nucleation and growth of hydrogen nanobubbles are key initial steps in electrochemical water splitting.

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can harm the embryonic development and cause life-long consequences in offspring’s health. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of PAE we have used a mouse model of early alcohol exposure, which is based on maternal &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; ingestion of 10% (v/v) ethanol for the first eight days of gestation (GD 0.5–8.5). Owing to the detected postnatal growth-restricted phenotype in the offspring of this mouse model and both prenatal and postnatal growth restriction in alcohol-exposed humans, we focused on imprinted genes &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like growth factor 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Igf2)&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Polypeptide N&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Paternally expressed gene 3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Peg3)&lt;/i&gt;, which all are known to be involved in embryonic and placental growth and development. We studied the effects of alcohol on DNA methylation level at the &lt;i&gt;Igf2/H19&lt;/i&gt; imprinting control region (ICR), &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; differentially methylated region 1, &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; ICR and &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; ICR in 9.5 embryonic days old (E9.5) embryos and placentas by using MassARRAY EpiTYPER. To determine alcohol-induced alterations globally, we also examined methylation in long interspersed nuclear elements (Line-1) in E9.5 placentas. We did not observe any significant alcohol-induced changes in DNA methylation levels. We explored effects of PAE on gene expression of E9.5 embryos as well as E9.5 and E16.5 placentas by using quantitative PCR. The expression of growth promoter gene &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt; was decreased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas. The expression of negative growth controller &lt;i&gt;H19&lt;/i&gt; was significantly increased in the alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos compared to controls, and conversely, a trend of decreased expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 and E16.5 placentas were observed. Furthermore, increased &lt;i&gt;Snrpn&lt;/i&gt; expression in alcohol-exposed E9.5 embryos was also detected. Our study indicates that albeit no alterations in the DNA methylation levels of studied sequences were detected by EpiTYPER, early PAE can affect the expression of imprinted genes in both developing embryo and placenta.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197461</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Early prenatal alcohol exposure alters imprinted gene expression in placenta and embryo in a mouse model</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi Marjonen, Mia Toivonen, Laura Lahti, Nina Kaminen-Ahola&lt;/p&gt;

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Factors affecting forest area change in Southeast Asia during 1980-2010</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mitochondrial modulation-induced activation of vagal sensory neuronal subsets by antimycin A, but not CCCP or rotenone, correlates with mitochondrial superoxide production</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine R.

A fundamental task is the recognition of biomedical named entities in text (BNER) such as genes/proteins, diseases, and species. Recently, a domain-independent method based on deep learning and statistical word embeddings, called long short-term memory network-conditional random field (LSTM-CRF), has been shown to outperform state-of-the-art entity-specific BNER tools. However, this method is dependent on gold-standard corpora (GSCs) consisting of hand-labeled entities, which tend to be small but highly reliable.

SSCs typically contain more noise than GSCs but have the advantage of containing many more training examples.

In this work, we analyze to what extent transfer learning improves upon state-of-the-art results for BNER. We demonstrate that transferring a deep neural network (DNN) trained on a large, noisy SSC to a smaller, but more reliable GSC significantly improves upon state-of-the-art results for BNER. Compared to a state-of-the-art baseline evaluated on 23 GSCs covering four different entity classes, transfer learning results in an average reduction in error of approximately 11%.

The development of farming was a catalyst for the evolution of the human diet from the varied subsistence practices of hunter-gatherers to the more globalised food economy we depend upon today. Although there has been considerable research into the dietary changes associated with the initial spread of farming, less attention has been given to how dietary choices continued to develop during subsequent millennia. A paleogenomic time transect for 5 millennia of human occupation in the Great Hungarian Plain spanning from the advent of the Neolithic to the Iron Age, showed major genomic turnovers. Here we assess where these genetic turnovers are associated with corresponding dietary shifts, by examining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of 52 individuals. Results provide evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers. Other Neolithic individuals and those from the Copper Age to Bronze Age periods relied mostly on terrestrial C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant resources.

One key step in this quality control is assessment of DNA damage: aDNA contains unique signatures of DNA damage that distinguish it from modern DNA, and so analyses of damage patterns can help confirm that DNA sequences obtained are from endogenous aDNA rather than from modern contamination. Predominant signatures of DNA damage include a high frequency of cytosine to thymine substitutions (C-to-T) at the ends of fragments, and elevated rates of purines (A &amp;amp; G) before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Existing QC procedures help assess damage by simply plotting for each sample, the C-to-T mismatch rate along the read and the composition of bases before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Here we present a more flexible and comprehensive model-based approach to infer and visualize damage patterns in aDNA, implemented in an R package aRchaic. This approach is based on a &amp;quot;grade of membership&amp;quot; model (also known as &amp;quot;admixture&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; model) in which each sample has an estimated grade of membership in each of K damage profiles that are estimated from the data. We illustrate aRchaic on data from several aDNA studies and modern individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Here, aRchaic clearly distinguishes modern from ancient samples irrespective of DNA extraction, lab and sequencing protocols. Additionally, through an in-silico contamination experiment, we show that the aRchaic grades of membership reflect relative levels of exogenous modern contamination. Together, the outputs of aRchaic provide a concise visual summary of DNA damage patterns, as well as other processes generating mismatches in the data.</description><published>1526886000000</published><fingerprint>e498ce96</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327684v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quality control plays a major role in the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA).

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>An assessment of false positive rates for malaria rapid diagnostic tests caused by non-&amp;lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&amp;lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle L.

There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Michelle L.

Background &lt;p&gt;While dyslipidemia importantly contributes to increased cardiovascular disease risk among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), data on lipid patterns among African adults on ART are limited. We describe the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and associated factors in two HIV clinics in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2014 and enrolled adult patients at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. We recorded patient characteristics, CVD risk factors and anthropometric measurements, using the WHO STEPS validated instrument. Non-fasting samples were taken for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;554 patients were enrolled, 50% at the rural HIV clinic, 72.7% were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 years (36–50); 97.3% were on ART, 84.4% on tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, 17.5% were overweight/obese and 27.8%% had elevated waist/hip ratio. 15.5% had elevated TC, 15.9% reduced HDL-c, 28.7% had elevated TG and 3.8% had elevated TC/HDL-c ratio. Lipid abnormalities were similar in rural and urban patients. Women had significantly higher burden of elevated TC and TG whereas men had higher prevalence of reduced HDL-c. Waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with elevated TC (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17–3.10, p = 0.01) and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio (aOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.38–8.85, p = 0.008). Increasing age was independently associated with elevated TC level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.51–4.59 for age 31–45; aOR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.24–10.95 for age &gt;45 years vs. ≤30 years; p-trend &amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found a moderate burden of dyslipidemia among Malawian adults on ART, which was similar in rural and urban patients but differed significantly between men and women. High waist-hip ratio predicted elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio and may be a practical tool for CVD risk indication in resource limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Dyslipidemia among rural and urban HIV patients in south-east Malawi</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alemayehu Amberbir, Victor Singano, Alfred Matengeni, Zahra Ismail, Gift Kawalazira, Adrienne K.

Even though in Mendelian diseases strong associations can be found for certain SNPs, in most of the complex diseases only modest associations can be identified from the GWAS. Therefore, the main challenge in such studies is to understand how multiple SNPs that have modest association with the phenotype interact and contribute to its aetiology.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><fingerprint>ee3c4299</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</link><title>Tissue-specific activities of the Fat1 cadherin cooperate to control neuromuscular morphogenesis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;To highlight the differences in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy control eyes, to assess the changes in MPOD in eyes treated with macular peeling, to investigate the relationships between MPOD changes and measures of retinal sensitivity such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and microperimetry.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional comparative study, 30 eyes affected by idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM, 15eyes) or full-thickness macular hole (FTMH, 15eyes) were compared with 60 eyes from 30 healthy age-matched patients. MPOD values (mean MPOD, maximum MPOD, MPOD area, and MPOD volume) were measured in a range of 4°–7° of eccentricity around the fovea, using the one-wavelength reflectometry method (Visucam 200, Carl-Zeiss Meditec). Patients affected by iERM and FTMH were treated with vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane-inner limiting membrane (ERM-ILM) peeling, with follow-up examinations performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were the differences in MPOD between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy eyes, changes in MPOD after ERM-ILM peeling, and relationships between MPOD and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean MPOD differed significantly between control eyes and those with iERM (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0001) or FTMH (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0006). The max MPOD and MPOD area increased, but not significantly. After peeling, the only significant change in MPOD was in MPOD volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .01). In the ERM group, postoperative mean MPOD correlated significantly with best-corrected visual acuity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = .739, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MPOD was reduced in patients with iERM or FTMH compared with healthy eyes. We found a significant correlation between the mean postoperative MPOD and postoperative BCVA, hypothesizing that the postoperative increase in mean MPOD could be due to a change in distribution for unfolding and expansion of the fovea after the peeling.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

The Old World farming system arose in the semi-arid Mediterranean environments of southwest Asia. Pioneer farmers settling the interior of the Balkans by the early sixth millennium BC were among the first to introduce southwest Asian-style cultivation and herding into areas with increasingly continental temperate conditions. Previous research has shown that the bioarchaeological assemblages from early farming sites in southeast Europe vary in their proportions of plant and animal taxa, but the relationship between taxonomic variation and climate has remained poorly understood. To uncover associations between multiple species and environmental factors simultaneously, we explored a dataset including altitude, five bioclimatic and 30 bioarchaeological variables (plant and animal taxa) for 57 of the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). An extension of correspondence analysis, CCA is widely used in applied ecology to answer similar questions of species-environment relationships, but has not been previously applied in prehistoric archaeology to explore taxonomic and climatic variables in conjunction. The analyses reveal that the changes in plant and animal exploitation which occurred with the northward dispersal of farmers, crops and livestock correlate with south-north climate gradients, and emphasize the importance of adaptations in the animal domain for the initial establishment of farming beyond the Mediterranean areas.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197225</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Pioneer farming in southeast Europe during the early sixth millennium BC: Climate-related adaptations in the exploitation of plants and animals</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Ivanova, Bea De Cupere, Jonathan Ethier, Elena Marinova&lt;/p&gt;

To study sodium homeostasis, we performed a genome-wide screen for deletion strains that show resistance to NaCl. We identified 34 NaCl-resistant strains. Among them, the largest group that consists of 10 genes related to membrane trafficking and 7 out of 10 genes are ESCRT proteins which are involved in cargo transportation into luminal vesicles within the multivesicular body. All of the ESCRT related mutants which showed sodium resistance also showed defects in vacuole fusion. To further understand the role of the ESCRT pathway in various ion homeostasis, we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various cation salts other than NaCl, including KCl, LiCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. While these ESCRT mutants showed resistance to LiCl, CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, they showed sensitivity to KCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various drugs which are known to inhibit the growth of fission yeast cells. While these ESCRT mutants were more or equally sensitive to most of the drugs tested as compared to the wild-type cells, they showed resistance to some drugs such as tamoxifen, fluorouracil and amiodarone. These results suggest that the ESCRT pathway plays important roles in drug/ion resistance of fission yeast.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198516</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Genome-wide screen reveals important roles for ESCRT proteins in drug/ion resistance of fission yeast</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yikun Yang, Qiannan Liu, Guanglie Jiang, Si Chen, Lina Zhou, Norihiro Sakamoto, Takayoshi Kuno, Yue Fang, Fan Yao&lt;/p&gt;

It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an &amp;quot;aesthetics associated traits cluster&amp;quot; and a Factor &amp;quot;personality traits cluster&amp;quot; which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Perception of aesthetics and personality traits in orthognathic surgery patients: A comparison of still and moving images</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Klaus Sinko, Ulrich S.

Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Klaus Sinko</name></author><fingerprint>f1104202</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c29:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;
Cannibalism is a commonly observed phenomenon in arthropod species having relevant consequences for population dynamics and individual fitness. It is a context-dependent behaviour and an understanding of the factors affecting cannibalism rate is crucial to highlight its ecological relevance. In mosquitoes, cannibalism between larval stages has been widely documented, and the role of density, food availability and length of contact between individuals also ascertained. However, although mosquitoes can develop in temporary water habitats with very heterogeneous topologies, the role of the site shape where cannibals and victims co-occur has been instead overlooked. In this paper, we investigated this issue by using a simulation approach and laboratory cannibalism experiments between old (third- and fourth-instars) and young (first-instar) larvae of the tiger mosquito &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Cannibalism in temporary waters: Simulations and laboratory experiments revealed the role of spatial shape in the mosquito &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;

The Na/K-ATPase is an important membrane ion transporter and a signaling receptor that is essential for maintaining normal cell function. The current study examined the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulating miR-29b-3p, an anti-fibrotic microRNA, in a mouse chronic kidney disease (CKD) model (5/6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial nephrectomy or PNx). The results showed that CKD induced significant reduction of miR-29b-3p expression in the heart tissue by activation of Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. To demonstrate the role of Na/K-ATPase signaling, we also performed the PNx surgery on Na/K-ATPase α1 heterozygous (α1+/-) mice, which expresses ~40% less Na/K-ATPase α1 compared to their wild type littermates (WT) and exhibits deficiency in Na/K-ATPase signaling. We found that CKD did not significantly change the miR-29b-3p expression in heart tissue from the α1+/- animals. We also found that CKD failed to activate Src and NFκB signaling in these animals. Using isolated cardiac fibroblasts from α1+/- mice and their WT littermates, we showed that ouabain, a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, induces decreased miR-29b-3p expression in fibroblasts isolated from WT mice, but had no effect in cells from α1+/- mice. Inhibition of NFκB by Bay11-7082 prevented ouabain-induced miR-29b-3p reduction in WT fibroblasts. To further confirm the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect of Na/K-ATPase signaling in regulation of miR-29b-3p and cardiac fibrosis in CKD animals, we used pNaKtide, a Src inhibiting peptide derived from the sequence of Na/K-ATPase, to block the activation of Na/K-ATPase signaling. The result showed that pNaKtide injection significantly increased miR-29b-3p expression and mitigated the CKD-induced cardiac fibrosis in these animals. These results clearly demonstrated that Na/K-ATPase signaling is an important mediator in CKD that regulates miR-29b-3p expression and cardiac fibrosis, which provides a novel target for regulation of miR-29b-3p in CKD. We also demonstrate that antagonizing Na/K-ATPase signaling by pNaKtide can reduce organ fibrosis through the stimulation of tissue miR-29b-3p expression.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197688</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Na/K-ATPase signaling mediates miR-29b-3p regulation and cardiac fibrosis formation in mice with chronic kidney disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher A.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197344</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A positive association between nutritional risk and the incidence of surgical site infections: A hospital-based register study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health in pregnant women: An evidence based meta-analysis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Extensively used in macroevolution for analysing diversification, and in epidemiology for estimating viral dynamics, the birth-death process (BDP) is an important null model for inferring the parameters of reconstructed phylogenies. In this paper we show how optimal, point process (Snyder) filtering techniques can be used for parametric inference on BDPs. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter (SF) to estimate birth and death rate parameters, given a reconstructed phylogeny. Our estimation procedure makes use of the equivalent Markov birth process description for a reconstructed birth-death phylogeny (Nee et al, 1994). We first analyse the popular constant rate BDP and show that our method gives results consistent with previous work. Among these results is an analytic solution to the special case of the Yule-Furry model. We also find an equivalence between the SF Poisson likelihood and two standard conditioned birth-death model likelihoods. We then generalise our estimation problem to BDPs with time varying rates and numerically solve the SF for two illustrative cases. Our results compare well with a recent Markov chain Monte Carlo method by Hohna et al (2016) and we numericaly show that both methods are solving the same likelihood functions. Lastly we apply the SF to a model selection problem on empirical data. We use the Australian Agamid dataset and predict the same relative model fit as that of the original maximum likelihood technique developed and used by Rabosky (2006) for this dataset. While several capable parametric and non-parametric birth-death estimators already exist, ours is the first to take the Nee et al approach, and directly computes the posterior distribution of the parameters. The SF makes no approximations, beyond those required for parameter space discretisation and numerical integration, and is mean square error optimal. It is deterministic, easily implementable and flexible. We think SFs present a promising alternative parametric BDP inference engine.</description><published>1525590000000</published><fingerprint>84c93d98</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/165712v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The discrete space, continuous time birth-death model is a key process for describing phylogenies in the absence of coalescent approximations.

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes.

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Environmental concentrations of metformin exposure affect aggressive behavior in the Siamese fighting fish, &amp;lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial blight (BB) in rice caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas oryzae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt;) is a major global production constraint, particularly in irrigated and rain-fed lowland areas. Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) is an elite, high-yielding, fine-grain type, BB-resistant rice variety possessing three BB-resistant genes (&lt;i&gt;Xa21&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;xa13&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;xa5&lt;/i&gt;) and is highly popular in the southern parts of India. As the BB pathogen is highly dynamic and the evolution of pathogen virulence against the deployed resistance genes is common, we added a novel BB-resistant gene, &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, into ISM through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) to increase the spectrum and durability of BB resistance. The breeding line PR 114 (Xa38) was used as the donor for &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, whereas ISM was used as the recurrent parent. Foreground selection was conducted using PCR-based gene-specific markers for the target genes, whereas background selection was conducted using a set of polymorphic SSR markers between the parents and backcrossing that continued until the third generation. Eighteen homozygous BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plants possessing all four BB-resistant genes in the homozygous state and with a recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of more than 92% were identified and advanced to the BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; generation.

White adipose tissue expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia and it is hypothesized that fibrosis or excess accumulation of extracellular matrix within adipose tissue may limit tissue expansion contributing to metabolic dysfunction. The pathways that control adipose tissue remodeling are only partially understood, however it is likely that adipose tissue stromal and perivascular progenitors participate in fibrotic remodeling and also serve as adipocyte progenitors. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of the secreted extracellular matrix protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) on adipose progenitor differentiation in the context of adipose tissue fibrosis. Treatment of 10T1/2 mouse cells with recombinant ACLP suppressed adipogenesis and enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, which was dependent on transforming growth factor-β receptor kinase activity. Mice fed a chronic high fat diet exhibited white adipose tissue fibrosis with elevated ACLP expression and cellular fractionation of these depots revealed that ACLP was co-expressed with collagens primarily in the inflammatory cell depleted stromal-vascular fraction (SVF). SVF cells isolated from mice fed a high fat diet secreted increased amounts of ACLP compared to low fat diet control SVF. These cells also exhibited reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity in vitro. Importantly, differentiation studies in primary human adipose stromal cells revealed that mature adipocytes do not express ACLP and exogenous ACLP administration blunted their differentiation potential while upregulating myofibroblastic markers. Collectively, these studies identify ACLP as a stromal derived mediator of adipose progenitor differentiation that may limit adipocyte expansion during white adipose tissue fibrosis.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197777</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein enhances adipose tissue stromal progenitor differentiation into myofibroblasts and is upregulated in fibrotic white adipose tissue</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mike Jager, Mi-Jeong Lee, Chendi Li, Stephen R.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526418000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Jinju Ma</name></author><fingerprint>64e44128</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197343</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>3</engagement><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395d4:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</originId><published>1526578752000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/712.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><title>How to achieve a successful biaxial marriage</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Poulin, P.</name></author><fingerprint>196ae3a3</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/712?rss=1</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00641/20180510/images/medium/ci-2017-00641d_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00641&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects. Mean CT was found to decrease with age, although there was no difference in CT between genders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Choroidal thickness in normal Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zeeshan Akhtar, Pukhraj Rishi, Ramasubramanian Srikanth, Ekta Rishi, Muna Bhende, Rajiv Raman&lt;/p&gt;

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197869</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Intact memory for local and distal cues in male and female rats that lack adult neurogenesis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Desiree R.

Therefore, single-cell transcriptome profiling of adult animals should reveal mature and progenitor cells.

Our ability to parse our acoustic environment relies on the brain’s capacity to extract statistical regularities from surrounding sounds. Previous work in regularity extraction has predominantly focused on the brain’s sensitivity to predictable patterns in sound sequences. However, natural sound environments are rarely completely predictable, often containing some level of randomness, yet the brain is able to effectively interpret its surroundings by extracting useful information from stochastic sounds. It has been previously shown that the brain is sensitive to the marginal lower-order statistics of sound sequences (i.e., mean and variance). In this work, we investigate the brain’s sensitivity to higher-order statistics describing temporal dependencies between sound events through a series of change detection experiments, where listeners are asked to detect changes in randomness in the pitch of tone sequences. Behavioral data indicate listeners collect statistical estimates to process incoming sounds, and a perceptual model based on Bayesian inference shows a capacity in the brain to track higher-order statistics. Further analysis of individual subjects’ behavior indicates an important role of perceptual constraints in listeners’ ability to track these sensory statistics with high fidelity. In addition, the inference model facilitates analysis of neural electroencephalography (EEG) responses, anchoring the analysis relative to the statistics of each stochastic stimulus. This reveals both a deviance response and a change-related disruption in phase of the stimulus-locked response that follow the higher-order statistics. These results shed light on the brain’s ability to process stochastic sound sequences.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ROlsYNEAxXQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><fingerprint>81094b30</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006162</link><title>Detecting change in stochastic sound sequences</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin Skerritt-Davis, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197489</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Impaired serial ordering in nondemented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

Contemporary rodent models for bipolar disorders split the bipolar spectrum into complimentary behavioral endophenotypes representing mania and depression. Widely accepted mania models typically utilize single gene transgenics or pharmacological manipulations, but inbred rodent strains show great potential as mania models. Their acceptance is often limited by the lack of genotypic data needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we used a unique strategy to inexpensively explore and confirm population allele differences in naturally occurring candidate variants in a manic rodent strain, the Madison (MSN) mouse strain. Variants were identified using whole exome resequencing on a small population of animals. Interesting candidate variants were confirmed in a larger population with genotyping. We enriched these results with observations of locomotor behavior from a previous study. Resequencing identified 447 structural variants that are mostly fixed in the MSN strain relative to control strains.

Contemporary rodent models for bipolar disorders split the bipolar spectrum into complimentary behavioral endophenotypes representing mania and depression. Widely accepted mania models typically utilize single gene transgenics or pharmacological manipulations, but inbred rodent strains show great potential as mania models. Their acceptance is often limited by the lack of genotypic data needed to establish construct validity. In this study, we used a unique strategy to inexpensively explore and confirm population allele differences in naturally occurring candidate variants in a manic rodent strain, the Madison (MSN) mouse strain. Variants were identified using whole exome resequencing on a small population of animals. Interesting candidate variants were confirmed in a larger population with genotyping. We enriched these results with observations of locomotor behavior from a previous study. Resequencing identified 447 structural variants that are mostly fixed in the MSN strain relative to control strains. After filtering and annotation, we found 11 non-synonymous MSN variants that we believe alter protein function. The allele frequencies for 6 of these variants were consistent with explanatory variants for the Madison strain’s phenotype. The variants are in the &lt;i&gt;Npas2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polr3c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Smarca4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Slc5a7&lt;/i&gt; genes, and many of these genes’ products are in pathways implicated in human bipolar disorders. Variants in &lt;i&gt;Smarca4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polr3c&lt;/i&gt; together explained over 40% of the variance in locomotor behavior in the Hsd:ICR founder strain. These results enhance the MSN strain’s construct validity and implicate altered nucleosome structure and transcriptional regulation as a chief molecular system underpinning behavior.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Michael C.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too. The devil finds work for idle hands, and for empty heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>How to Be a Good Medicinal Chemist</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>ff452d4b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/22/how-to-be-a-good-medicinal-chemist</href></item></alternate><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13550</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528179501039</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163ce98a7ef:529af15:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0056-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic and protective efficacy of a dengue antibody against Zika infection in rhesus monkeys, Published online: 04 June 2018;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chinese parents have access to domestic and foreign vaccines for their children. Their vaccine preferences are unclear, especially given recent pharmaceutical quality scandals and widely held beliefs deriving from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This study characterized parental beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of Chinese and foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In May 2014, caregivers of young children at public immunization clinics in Shanghai, China, responded to a survey on vaccine perceptions. The two outcomes (differential belief in the effectiveness and safety of foreign vs domestic vaccines) were separately regressed onto demographic predictors in multinomial logistic regression models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 618 caregivers, 56% thought the effectiveness of domestic and foreign vaccines were comparable; 33% thought domestic were more effective and 11% foreign. Two-thirds thought foreign and domestic vaccines had similar safety; 11% thought domestic were safer and 21% thought foreign were safer. Compared to college graduates, those with a high school education or less had greater odds of believing domestic vaccines were more effective, and also had greater odds of believing imported vaccines were safer. Greater trust in TCM was not associated with differential beliefs in the effectiveness or safety of domestic vs foreign vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Although there is no evidence that foreign and domestic vaccines differ in either effectiveness or safety, less educated caregivers in China (but not those with greater trust in TCM) appear to believe such differences exist. Further exploration of the causes of these beliefs may be necessary in order to optimize vaccine communications in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197437</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Parent and caregiver perceptions about the safety and effectiveness of foreign and domestic vaccines in Shanghai, China</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhuoying Huang, Xiaodong Sun, Abram L.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197822</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Costs of cold acclimation on survival and reproductive behavior in &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth R.

While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation, the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored.

Intercropping is an important agronomic practice adopted to increase crop production and resource efficiency in areas with intensive agricultural production. Two sequential field trials were conducted in 2015–2016 to investigate the effect of shading on the morphological features, leaf structure, and photosynthetic characteristics of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system. Three treatments were designed on the basis of different row configurations A1 (“50 cm + 50 cm” one row of maize and one row of soybean with a 50 cm spacing between the rows), A2 (“160 cm + 40 cm” two rows of maize by wide-narrow row planting, where two rows of soybean were planted in the wide rows with a width of 40 cm, and with 60 cm row spacing was used between the maize and soybean rows), and CK (sole cropping of soybean, with 70 cm rows spacing). Results showed that the photosynthetically active radiation transmittances of soybean canopy at V5 stage under A2 treatment (31.1%) were considerably higher than those under A1 (8.7%) treatment, and the red-to-far-red ratio was reduced significantly under A1 (0.7) and A2 (1.0) treatments compared with those under CK (1.2). By contrast with CK, stem diameter, total aboveground biomass, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate decreased significantly except plant height under A1 and A2. The thickness of palisade tissue and spongy tissue of soybean leaf under A1 and A2 were significantly reduced at V5 stage compared with CK. The leaf thicknesses under A1 and A2 were lower than those in CK by 39.5% and 18.2%, respectively. At the R1 stage of soybean (after maize harvest), the soybean plant height, stem biomass, leaf biomass and petiole biomass under A1 and A2 treatments were still significantly lower than those under CK, but no significant differences were observed in Chl a/b, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, epidermis thickness and spongy tissue thickness of soybean leaves in A2 compared with CK. In addition, the soybean yields (g plant&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) under A1 and A2 were 54.69% and 16.83% lower than those in CK, respectively. These findings suggested that soybean plants can regulate its morphological characteristics and leaf anatomical structures under different light environments.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198159</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of shading and light recovery on the growth, leaf structure, and photosynthetic performance of soybean in a maize-soybean relay-strip intercropping system</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanfang Fan, Junxu Chen, Yajiao Cheng, Muhammad Ali Raza, Xiaoling Wu, Zhonglin Wang, Qinlin Liu, Rui Wang, Xiaochun Wang, Taiwen Yong, Weiguo Liu, Jiang Liu, Junbo Du, Kai Shu, Wenyu Yang, Feng Yang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. produce a broad spectrum of lipopeptide biosurfactants, among which surfactin, iturin and fengycin are widely studied families. The goals of this study were to characterize the biosurfactant activity of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. and to investigate their motility and biofilm formation capabilities. In addition, we extracted lipopeptides from these bacteria to assess their antifungal activities and analyzed these products by mass spectrometry (MS). &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;amyloliquefaciens&lt;/i&gt; FZB42, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. NH 217 and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; NH-100 exhibited excellent biosurfactant and surface spreading activities, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;atrophaeus&lt;/i&gt; 176s and &lt;i&gt;Paenibacillus polymyxa&lt;/i&gt; C1225 showed moderate activity, and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; 168 showed no activity. Strains FZB42, NH-100, NH-217, 176s and CC125 exhibited excellent biofilm formation capabilities.

Lipopeptide extracts of these strains also showed hemolytic activity, demonstrating their strong potential to produce surfactants. LCMS-ESI analyses identified the presence of surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the extracts of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains.

Purkinje neuron dendritic degeneration precedes cell loss in cerebellar ataxia, but the basis for dendritic vulnerability in ataxia remains poorly understood. Recent work has suggested that potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel dysfunction and consequent spiking abnormalities contribute to Purkinje neuron degeneration, but little attention has been paid to how K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction impacts dendritic excitability and the role this may play in the degenerative process. We examined the relationship between K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel dysfunction, dendritic excitability and dendritic degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). Examination of published RNA sequencing data from SCA1 mice revealed reduced expression of several K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that are important regulators of excitability in Purkinje neuron dendrites. Patch clamp recordings in Purkinje neurons from SCA1 mice identified increased dendritic excitability in the form of enhanced back-propagation of action potentials and an increased propensity to produce dendritic calcium spikes. Dendritic excitability could be rescued by restoring expression of large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and activating other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels with baclofen. Importantly, this treatment combination improves motor performance and mitigates dendritic degeneration in SCA1 mice. These results suggest that reduced expression of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels results in persistently increased dendritic excitability at all stages of disease in SCA1, which in turn may contribute to the dendritic degeneration that precedes cell loss.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198040</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Dendritic potassium channel dysfunction may contribute to dendrite degeneration in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ravi Chopra, David D.

Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data. Methods and Findings: Using targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3,601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, 1,228 of which were multidrug resistant, we investigated the use of machine learning to predict phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs. The final model, a multitask wide and deep neural network (MD-WDNN), achieved improved high predictive performance: the average AUCs were 0.979 for first-line drugs and 0.936 for second-line drugs during repeated cross-validation. On an independent validation set, the MD-WDNN showed average AUCs, sensitivities, and specificities, respectively, of 0.937, 87.9%, and 92.7% for first-line drugs and 0.891, 82.0% and 90.1% for second-line drugs. In addition to being able to learn from samples that have only been partially phenotyped, our proposed multidrug architecture shares information across different anti-tuberculosis drugs and genes to provide a more accurate phenotypic prediction. We use t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualization and feature importance analyses to examine inter-drug similarities. Conclusions: Machine learning is capable of accurately predicting resistant status using genomic information and holds promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.</description><published>1528182000000</published><fingerprint>e41870ac</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/275628v2?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The diagnosis of multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis is a global health priority.

Conclusions: Machine learning is capable of accurately predicting resistant status using genomic information and holds promise in bringing sequencing technologies closer to the bedside.</content></content><title>Deep learning predicts tuberculosis drug resistance status from genome sequencing data [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Chen, M.

Inadequate care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and may be associated with adverse outcomes after dialysis. The nationwide pre-end-stage renal disease pay for performance program (P4P) has been implemented in Taiwan to improve quality of CKD care. However, the effectiveness of the P4P program in improving the outcomes of pre-dialysis care and dialysis is uncertain. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study. Patients who newly underwent long-term dialysis (≥3 mo) between 2007 and 2009 were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Based on the patient enrolment of the P4P program, they were categorized into P4P or non-P4P groups. We analysed pre-dialysis care, healthcare expenditures, and mortality between two groups. Among the 26 588 patients, 25.5% participated in the P4P program. The P4P group received significantly better quality of care, including a higher frequency of glomerular filtration rate measurement and CKD complications survey, a higher rate of vascular access preparation, and more frequent use of arteriovenous fistulas than the non-P4P group did. The P4P group had a 68.4% reduction of the 4-year total healthcare expenditure (excluding dialysis fee), which is equivalent to US$345.7 million, and a significant 22% reduction in three-year mortality after dialysis (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.75–0.82, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the non-P4P group.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Acute intermittent hypoxia and rehabilitative training following cervical spinal injury alters neuronal hypoxia- and plasticity-associated protein expression</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</content></content><updated>1526677200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Atiq Hassan</name></author><fingerprint>fb4f7ece</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094074:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197873</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric J.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Keeping up with sea-level rise: Carbonate production rates in Palau and Yap, western Pacific Ocean</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score ≥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score ≤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0–8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197637</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Increased circulating microRNA-122 is a biomarker for discrimination and risk stratification in patients defined by sepsis-3 criteria</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Differentially abundant proteins associated with heterosis in the primary roots of popcorn</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mathias F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Due to the surrounding bone, the human inner ear is relatively inaccessible and difficult to reach for cellular and molecular analyses. However, these types of investigations are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and progression of several inner ear disorders. Moreover, the fluid from the inner ear cannot be sampled for micro-chemical analyses from healthy individuals &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, in the present paper, we studied patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) undergoing trans-labyrinthine surgery (TLS). Our primary aim was to identify perilymph proteins in patients with VS on an individual level. Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198442</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma.

Our second aim was to investigate the proteins identified at a functional level and our final aim was to search for biological markers for tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients underwent TLS for sporadic VS. Perilymph was aspirated through the round window before opening the labyrinth. One sample was contaminated and excluded resulting in 15 usable samples. Perilymph samples were analyzed with an online tandem LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Data were analyzed with MaxQuant software to identify the total number of proteins and to quantify proteins in individual samples. Protein function was analyzed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation tool. Associations between perilymph protein content, clinical parameters, tumor-associated hearing loss and tumor diameter were assessed using Random Forest and Boruta. In total, 314 proteins were identified; 60 in all 15 patients and 130 proteins only once in 15 patients. Ninety-one proteins were detected in at least 12 out of 15 patients. Random Forest followed by Boruta analysis confirmed that alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (P02765) was an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss. In addition, functional analysis showed that numerous processes were significantly increased in the perilymph. The top three enriched biological processes were: 1) secondary metabolic processes; 2) complement activation and 3) cell recognition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The proteome of perilymph in patients with vestibular schwannoma has an inter-individual stable section. However, even in a cohort with homogenous disease, the variation between individuals represented the majority of the detected proteins. Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, P02765, was shown to be an independent variable for tumor-associated hearing loss, a finding that needs to be verified in other studies. In pathway analysis perilymph had highly enriched functions, particularly in terms of increased immune and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527886800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Jesper Edvardsson Rasmussen</name></author><fingerprint>f6951ebe</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198442</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198442</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525858023424</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1634439b800:9d4c6e:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04298-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Biosynthetic pathway for furanosteroid demethoxyviridin and identification of an unusual pregnane side-chain cleavage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biosynthetic pathway for furanosteroid demethoxyviridin and identification of an unusual pregnane side-chain cleavage, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04298-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04298-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Demethoxyviridin is a fungal steroid that inhibits a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, an enzyme contributing to tumor progression.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197181</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Potential travel cost saving in urban public-transport networks using smartphone guidance</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Another cat and mouse game: Deciphering the evolution of the SCGB superfamily and exploring the molecular similarity of major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse ABP using computational approaches</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Rajesh Durairaj</name></author><fingerprint>a534a1f8</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb92c:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198562</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xueli Zhang, Congwei Sun, Zheng Zhang, Zhijun Dai, Yuan Chen, Xiong Yuan, Zheming Yuan, Wenbang Tang, Lanzhi Li, Zhongli Hu&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198562</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: Genetic dissection of main and epistatic effects of QTL based on augmented triple test cross design</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xueli Zhang, Congwei Sun, Zheng Zhang, Zhijun Dai, Yuan Chen, Xiong Yuan, Zheming Yuan, Wenbang Tang, Lanzhi Li, Zhongli Hu&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Xueli Zhang</name></author><fingerprint>fd0cd795</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198562</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198562</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475059:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196955</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Komatsu, Shouichi Fujimoto, Shoichi Maruyama, Masashi Mukoyama, Hitoshi Sugiyama, Kazuhiko Tsuruya, Hiroshi Sato, Jun Soma, Junko Yano, Seiji Itano, Tomoya Nishino, Toshinobu Sato, Ichiei Narita, Hitoshi Yokoyama&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical presentation and prognosis of adult and elderly patients with IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura) accompanied by nephritis (IgAV-N) have not been investigated in detail. We therefore surveyed the features and outcomes of IgAV-N based on nationwide data derived from the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry (J-RBR).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multi-center cohort study compared the clinicopathological parameters at diagnosis, initial therapies and outcomes between 106 adult (age 19–64 years) and 46 elderly (≥65 years) patients with IgAV-N who were registered in the J-RBR between 2007 and 2012. The primary end-points comprised a 50% increase in serum creatinine (sCr) values or end-stage kidney disease. Factors affecting a decrease in renal function were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Rates of hypertension, impaired renal function, hypoalbuminemia and crescentic glomerulonephritis were significantly higher among the elderly, than the adult patients. About 80% and 60% of the patients in both groups were respectively treated with corticosteroid and a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. Both groups had favorable renal survival rates for nine years (93.6% and 91.4% of the adult and elderly patients, respectively). Significantly more elderly than adult patients developed a 50% increase in sCr during a mean observation period of 3.9 years (21.7% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.012), and significantly fewer elderly, than adult patients achieved clinical remission (23.9% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis selected advanced age (≥65 years) and lower serum albumin values as independent prognostic factors for a decline in renal function, whereas steroid pulse therapy helped to preserve renal function.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The renal prognosis of adult and elderly patients with IgAV-N was favorable when treated aggressively with corticosteroid and RAS blockade.

To systematically identify these interactions, an array of mutants is challenged with a compound and monitored for fitness defects, generating a chemical-genetic interaction profile that provides a quantitative, unbiased description of the cellular function(s) perturbed by the compound. Genetic interactions, obtained from genome-wide double-mutant screens, provide a key for interpreting the functional information contained in chemical-genetic interaction profiles. Despite the utility of this approach, integrative analyses of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction networks have not been systematically evaluated. We developed a method, called CG-TARGET (Chemical Genetic Translation via A Reference Genetic nETwork), that integrates large-scale chemical-genetic interaction screening data with a genetic interaction network to predict the biological processes perturbed by compounds. CG-TARGET compared favorably to a baseline enrichment approach across a variety of benchmarks, achieving similar accuracy while substantially improving the ability to control the false discovery rate of biological process predictions. We applied CG-TARGET to a recent screen of nearly 14,000 chemical compounds in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, integrating this dataset with the global S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network to prioritize over 1500 compounds with high-confidence biological process predictions for further study. Upon investigation of the compatibility of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction profiles, we observed that one-third of observed chemical-genetic interactions contributed to the highest-confidence biological process predictions and that negative chemical-genetic interactions overwhelmingly formed the basis of these predictions.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, endogenous RNAs that post-transcriptionally repress mRNAs. Over the course of evolution, many new miRNAs are known to have emerged and added to the existing miRNA repertoires of drosophilids and vertebrates. Despite the large number of miRNAs in existence, the complementary pairing of only ~7 bases between miRNAs and mRNAs is sufficient to induce repression. Thus, miRNA targeting is so widespread that genes coexpressed with a miRNA have evolved to avoid sites that are targeted by the miRNA. Besides this avoidance, little is known about the preferential modes of miRNA targeting. Therefore, to elucidate miRNA targeting preference and avoidance, we evaluated the bias of the number of miRNA targeting occurrences in relation to expression intensities of miRNAs and their coexpressed target mRNAs by surveying transcriptome data from human organs. We found that miRNAs preferentially target genes with intermediate levels of expression, while avoiding highly expressed ones, and that older miRNAs have greater targeting specificity, suggesting that specificity increases during the course of evolution.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198142</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Human microRNAs preferentially target genes with intermediate levels of expression and its formation by mammalian evolution</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hisakazu Iwama, Kiyohito Kato, Hitomi Imachi, Koji Murao, Tsutomu Masaki&lt;/p&gt;

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells.

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells. In contrast, ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; transcript abundance was highly reduced compared to that of the restoring &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;. Consistently, changes in protein complexes containing CMS-associated mitochondrial protein in anthers were very minor. Accordingly, we concluded that ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; is a hypomorph that acts as a non-restoring allele but has the potential to support another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. it is a modifier candidate.</content></content><updated>1527886800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Takumi Arakawa</name></author><fingerprint>1bae1ed3</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527757899736</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b57787d8:2ea773b:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26896-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26896-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26896-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/jlOBAUIaBQE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>cf801d41</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26896-2</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26896-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26896-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/jlOBAUIaBQE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>A regionally-adapted implementation of conservation agriculture delivers rapid improvements to soil properties associated with crop yield stability</title><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Alwyn Williams</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26896-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/jlOBAUIaBQE/s41598-018-26896-2</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559154:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197168</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The impact of being bullied at school on psychological distress and work engagement in a community sample of adult workers in Japan</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal propagule bank could facilitate the regeneration and plantation of seedlings in disturbed area. In this study, Masson pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus massoniana&lt;/i&gt;) seedlings were used to bait the ECM fungal propagule bank buried in the soils collected from a manganese (Mn) mine wasteland and a non-polluted area in China. After 6-month growth, we found the seedlings grown in the Mn mine soil (Mn:3200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not display any toxicity symptoms. Based on morphotyping and ITS-PCR sequencing, we identified a total of 16 ECM fungal OTUs (operative taxonomic units) at 97% similarity threshold, among which 11 OTUs were recovered in the Mn mine soils and 14 in the non-polluted soil. Two soil types shared 9 OTUs and both of them were dominated by a &lt;i&gt;Tylospora&lt;/i&gt; sp. Based on those soil propagule banks in Masson pine forests reported in previous, we speculated that some Atheliaceae species may be preferred in the soil propagule bank of some pine species, such as Masson pine. In addition, NMDS ordination displayed geographical position effects on soil propagule banks in five Masson pine forest from three sites at regional scale. In conclusion, Masson pine ECM seedlings could grow well in the Mn wasteland as a suitable tree species used for reforestation application in Mn mineland, in addition, Mn pollution did not alter the dominant ECM fungal species in the soil propagule banks.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Soil propagule bank of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Masson pine (&amp;lt;i&gt;Pinus massoniana&amp;lt;/i&gt;) grown in a manganese mine wasteland</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Huang, Qisheng Han, Junjian Li&lt;/p&gt;

Cells switch between quiescence and proliferation states for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regeneration. At the restriction point (R-point), cells become irreversibly committed to the completion of the cell cycle independent of mitogen. The mechanism involving hyper-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) and activation of transcription factor E2F is linked to the R-point passage. However, stress stimuli trigger exit from the cell cycle back to the mitogen-sensitive quiescent state after Rb hyper-phosphorylation but only until APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; inactivation. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation in mammalian cells with respect to mitogen and stress signals. The model integrates the current mechanistic knowledge and accounts for the recent experimental observations with cells exiting quiescence and proliferating cells. We show that Cyclin E:Cdk2 couples Rb-E2F and APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable switches and temporally segregates the R-point and the G1/S transition. A redox-dependent mutual antagonism between APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; and its inhibitor Emi1 makes the inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt; bistable. We show that the levels of Cdk inhibitor (CKI) and mitogen control the reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation. Further, we propose that shifting of the mitogen-induced transcriptional program to G2-phase in proliferating cells might result in an intermediate Cdk2 activity at the mitotic exit and in the immediate inactivation of APC/C&lt;sup&gt;Cdh1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our study builds a coherent framework and generates hypotheses that can be further explored by experiments.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198420</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mathematical modelling of reversible transition between quiescence and proliferation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nishtha Pandey, P.
