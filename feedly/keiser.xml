A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:131f:910a81bb</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Breslin, John Joseph Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin, Bronac Flanagan, Harm Van Zalinge, Steve Hall, Matthew Walker, Alexei Verkhratsky, Liam McDaid&lt;/p&gt;

These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</originId><author><name>Vinson, V.</name></author><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-f?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>79c46d1d</fingerprint><published>1525974002000</published><title>Dynamic fibrils drive protein assembly</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.6.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ca:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5144.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5144.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>Micaela Y.

The smooth hammerhead shark, &lt;i&gt;Sphyrna zygaena&lt;/i&gt;, is a cosmopolitan semipelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic oceanic fisheries, especially pelagic longlines targeting swordfish and/or tunas. From 2012 to 2016, eight smooth hammerheads were tagged with Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags in the inter-tropical region of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, with successful transmissions received from seven tags (total of 319 tracking days). Results confirmed the smooth hammerhead is a highly mobile species, as the longest migration ever documented for this species (&gt; 6600 km) was recorded. An absence of a diel vertical movement behavior was noted, with the sharks spending most of their time at surface waters (0–50 m) above 23°C. The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders, and the overlap with the species vertical distribution was calculated. The overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles (~40% of overlap time).

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85436:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection. The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85438:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro, Jesus Dubert, Rita Nolasco, Eric Desmond Barton&lt;/p&gt;

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Factors associated with one-year mortality after recovery from critical illness are not well understood. Clinicians generally lack information regarding post-hospital discharge outcomes of patients from the intensive care unit, which may be important when counseling patients and families.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We sought to determine which factors among patients who survived for at least 30 days post-ICU admission are associated with one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all ICU patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical center from 2001–2012 who survived ≥30 days from ICU admission. Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to identify the variables that are associated with one-year mortality. The primary outcome was one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;32,420 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Among patients who survived to ≥30 days, 28,583 (88.2%) survived for greater than one year, whereas 3,837 (11.8%) did not. Variables associated with decreased one-year survival include: increased age, malignancy, number of hospital admissions within the prior year, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive agent use, sepsis, history of congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the need for renal replacement therapy. Numerous effect modifications between these factors were found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Among survivors of critical illness, a significant number survive less than one year. More research is needed to help clinicians accurately identify those patients who, despite surviving their acute illness, are likely to suffer one-year mortality, and thereby to improve the quality of the decisions and care that impact this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16350da86da:1e315e1:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sharukh Lokhandwala, Ned McCague, Abdullah Chahin, Braiam Escobar, Mengling Feng, Mohammad M.

Although NF-{kappa}B signaling exhibits significant variability across single cells, some target genes exhibit fold-change detection of NF-{kappa}B, which may buffer against stochastic variation in signaling molecules. However, this observation was made at target genes supporting high levels of TNF-inducible transcription. It is unknown if fold-change detection is maintained at NF-{kappa}B target genes with low levels of TNF-inducible transcription, for which stochastic promoter events may be more pronounced. Here we used a microfluidic cell-trapping device to measure how TNF-induced activation of NF-{kappa}B controls transcription in single Jurkat T cells at the promoters of integrated HIV and the endogenous cytokine gene IL6, which produce only a few transcripts per cell. We tracked TNF-stimulated NF-{kappa}B RelA nuclear translocation by live-cell imaging and then quantified transcript number by RNA FISH in the same cell. We found that TNF-induced transcription correlates with fold change in nuclear NF-{kappa}B with similar strength at low versus high abundance target genes. A computational model of TNF-NF-{kappa}B signaling, which implements fold-change detection from competition for binding to {kappa}B motifs, was sufficient to reproduce fold-change detection across the experimentally measured range of transcript outputs. Nevertheless, we found that gene-specific trends in transcriptional noise and levels of promoter-bound NF-{kappa}B predicted by the model were inconsistent with our experimental observations at low abundance gene targets. Our results reveal a gap in our understanding of RelA-mediated transcription for low abundance transcripts and suggest that cells use additional biological mechanisms to maintain robustness of NF-{kappa}B fold-change detection while tuning transcriptional output.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163d174f407:57d5b42:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The transcription factor NF-{kappa}B promotes inflammatory and stress-responsive gene transcription across a range of cell types in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF).

Mesothelin is a cell surface protein that is overexpressed in numerous cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, liver, and pancreatic tumors. Aberrant expression of mesothelin has been shown to promote tumor progression and metastasis through interaction with established tumor biomarker CA125. Therefore, molecules that specifically bind to mesothelin have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, no mesothelin-targeting molecules are currently approved for routine clinical use. While antibodies that target mesothelin are in development, some clinical applications may require a targeting molecule with an alternative protein fold. For example, non-antibody proteins are more suitable for molecular imaging and may facilitate diverse chemical conjugation strategies to create drug delivery complexes. In this work, we engineered variants of the fibronectin type III domain (Fn3) non-antibody protein scaffold to bind to mesothelin with high affinity, using directed evolution and yeast surface display. Lead engineered Fn3 variants were solubly produced and purified from bacterial culture at high yield. Upon specific binding to mesothelin on human cancer cell lines, the engineered Fn3 proteins internalized and co-localized to early endosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-antibody proteins engineered to bind mesothelin. The results validate that non-antibody proteins can be engineered to bind to tumor biomarker mesothelin, and encourage the continued development of engineered variants for applications such as targeted diagnostics and therapeutics.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475064:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison R.

Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) such as cathelicidins are multifunctional effectors of the innate immune system with both antimicrobial and pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions. Chicken cathelicidin-2 (CATH-2) has multiple immunomodulatory effects &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and the D-amino acid analog of this peptide has been shown to partially protect young chicks from a bacterial infection. However, the mechanisms responsible for CATH-2 mediated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protection have not been investigated so far. In this study, D-CATH-2 was administered &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; and the immune status and microbiota of the chicks were investigated at 7 days posthatch to elucidate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mechanisms of the peptide. In three consecutive studies, no effects on numbers and functions of immune cells were found and only small changes were seen in gene expression of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). In two studies, intestinal microbiota composition was determined which was highly variable, suggesting that it was strongly influenced by environmental factors. In both studies, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; D-CATH-2 treatment caused significant reduction of Ruminococcaceae and &lt;i&gt;Butyricicoccus&lt;/i&gt; in the cecum and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia/Shigella&lt;/i&gt; in both ileum and cecum. In conclusion, this study shows that, in the absence of an infectious stimulus, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; administration of a CATH-2 analog alters the microbiota composition but does not affect the chicks’ immune system posthatch.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc3:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tryntsje Cuperus, Marina D.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Dye-less chromoendoscopy is an emerging technology for colorectal polyp characterization. Herein, we investigated whether the newly introduced I-scan optical enhancement (OE) can accurately predict polyp histology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective three-phased study, 84 patients with 230 diminutive colorectal polyps were included. During the first two study phases, five endoscopists assessed whether analysis of polyp colour, surface and vascular pattern under i-scan OE can differentiate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, junior and experienced endoscopists (JE, EE, each n = 4) not involved in the prior study phases made a post hoc diagnosis of polyp histology using a static i-scan OE image database. Histopathology was used as a gold-standard in all study phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall accuracy of i-scan OE for histology prediction was 90% with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of 91%, 90%, 86% and 94%, respectively. In high confidence predictions, the diagnostic accuracy increased to 93% with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94%, 91%, 89% and 96%. Colonoscopy surveillance intervals were predicted correctly in ≥ 90% of patients. In the post hoc analysis EE predicted polyp histology under i-scan OE with an overall accuracy of 91%. After a single training session, JE achieved a comparable diagnostic performance for predicting polyp histology with i-scan OE.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The histology of diminutive colorectal polyps can be accurately predicted with i-scan OE &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.

Yu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, has activity in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Potential mechanisms of action include degrading constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) or inhibiting other drug-resistance pathways (e.g., Wnt-signaling). Published pharmacokinetics data suggests that niclosamide has poor oral bioavailability, potentially limiting its use as a cancer drug. Therefore, we launched a Phase I study testing oral niclosamide in combination with enzalutamide, for longer and at higher doses than those used to treat helminthic infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard-dose enzalutamide in men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with abiraterone. Niclosamide was given three-times-daily (TID) at the following dose-levels: 500, 1000 or 1500mg. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives, included measuring AR-V expression from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the AdnaTest assay, evaluating PSA changes and determining niclosamide’s pharmacokinetic profile.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;20 patients screened and 5 enrolled after passing all screening procedures. 13(65%) patients had detectable CTCs, but only one was AR-V+. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 3 patients on the 500mg TID cohort; however, both (N = 2) subjects on the 1000mg TID cohort experienced DLTs (prolonged grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; and colitis). The maximum plasma concentration ranged from 35.7–82 ng/mL and was not consistently above the minimum effective concentration in preclinical studies. There were no PSA declines in any enrolled subject. Because plasma concentrations at the maximum tolerated dose (500mg TID) were not consistently above the expected therapeutic threshold, the Data Safety Monitoring Board closed the study for futility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Oral niclosamide could not be escalated above 500mg TID, and plasma concentrations were not consistently above the threshold shown to inhibit growth in CRPC models. Oral niclosamide is not a viable compound for repurposing as a CRPC treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Clinical trial registry &lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02532114&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454b:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael T.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The first aim of this study was to analyze the relationships between liver stiffness measurement, hepatic venous pressure and liver fibrosis. The second aim was to demonstrate the utility of real-time shear wave elastography for evaluation of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients before and after balloon hepatic venous angioplasty.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 32 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome slated for successful balloon angioplasty met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Shear wave elastography was used to generate dynamic liver stiffness measurement 2 days before angioplasty and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty. Hepatic venous pressures were measured during balloon angioplasty. Correlations among liver stiffness, hepatic venous pressure, and fibrosis were assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Mean liver stiffness was 35.17 ± 10.60 kPa, 20.15 ± 5.47 kPa, 15.36 ± 4.34 kPa and 15.68 ± 5.58 kPa at baseline and 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months after angioplasty, respectively. Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001); liver stiffness measured at 6 months after angioplasty was not significantly different from that measured at 3 months after angioplasty (P = 0.636). Analysis of liver stiffness measurement and hepatic venous pressure before balloon angioplasty yielded a coefficient of correlation r = 0.701 (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Before and 2d after angioplasty, liver stiffness measurement did not correlated with fibrosis (r = − 0.170, P = 0.22), (r = 0.223, P = 0.220), respectively, while the LSM difference before and 2 days after angioplasty negatively correlated with stiffness severity (r = − 0.502, P = 0.003). Liver stiffness measured at 2 days and 3 months after angioplasty was significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.001), remaining stable at 3 months, though still in the cirrhotic range.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The liver stiffness of Budd-Chiari syndrome patients, measured by shear wave elastography, decreased considerably after hepatic venous recanalization, and significantly correlated with hepatic venous pressure though not with degree of fibrosis. Shear wave elastography may be effective in monitoring short- and long-term treatment outcomes in Budd-Chiari syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb90f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hong-Wei Wang, Hua-Ning Shi, Jia Cheng, Fang Xie, Yu-Kun Luo, Jie Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Shear wave elastography may be effective in monitoring short- and long-term treatment outcomes in Budd-Chiari syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027433?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027433?af=R</originId><author><name>Ying Yuan</name></author><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5027433?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>db3de8a6</fingerprint><published>1525742596000</published><title>The strengths and limitations of effective centroid force models explored by studying isotopic effects in liquid water</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccb2:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262956v3?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/262956v3?rss=1</originId><author><name>Breitwieser, F.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 μs trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:1321:910a81bb</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed8:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

Ferroptosis is a cell death process driven by damage to cell membranes and linked to numerous human diseases. Ferroptosis is caused by loss of activity of the key enzyme that is tasked with repairing oxidative damage to cell membranes—glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 normally removes the dangerous products of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from this type of damage; when GPX4 fails, ferroptosis ensues. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, necrosis, and other modes of cell death. Several key mysteries regarding how cells die during ferroptosis remain unsolved. First, the drivers of lipid peroxidation are not yet clear. Second, the subcellular location of lethal lipid peroxides remains an outstanding question. Finally, how exactly lipid peroxidation leads to cell death is an unsolved mystery. Answers to these questions will provide insights into the mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death and associated human diseases, as well as new therapeutic strategies for such diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LCHMnGYG4g0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16393412161:65298:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huizhong Feng, Brent R.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ae:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

Many cellular processes depend on a precise structural organization of molecular components. Here, we established that neurons grown in culture provide a suitable system for in situ structural investigations of cellular structures by cryo-electron tomography, a method that allows high resolution, three-dimensional imaging of fully hydrated, vitrified cellular samples. A higher level of detail of cellular components present in our images allowed us to quantitatively characterize presynaptic and cytoskeletal organization, as well as structures involved in axonal transport and endocytosis. In this way we provide a structural framework into which information from other methods need to fit. Importantly, we show that short pleomorphic linkers (tethers and connectors) extensively interconnect different types of spherical vesicles and other lipid membranes in neurons imaged in a close-to-native state. These linkers likely serve to organize and precisely position vesicles involved in endocytosis, axonal transport and synaptic release. Hence, structural interactions via short linkers may serve as ubiquitous vesicle organizers in neuronal cells.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b778:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nikolas Schrod, Dimitri Vanhecke, Ulrike Laugks, Valentin Stein, Yoshiyuki Fukuda, Miroslava Schaffer, Wolfgang Baumeister, Vladan Lucic&lt;/p&gt;

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities.

Global cooperation is urgently needed to prevent risks of world-wide extreme events and disasters for sustainable development. In human societies, however, there exists bias toward interacting with partners with similar characteristics, but not contributing globally. We study how complex interactive behaviors evolve under risks through proposing a threshold public goods game model. In the model, individuals either play games with participants who own the same phenotype, or contribute to the collective target of global public goods. We further introduce an insurance compensation mechanism into the model to probe the evolution of global cooperation. It is found that the introduction of the insurance remarkably promotes the emergence of global cooperative behavior and inhibits the tendency to play games only with individuals of the same phenotype. Besides, contrary to models without insurance, global cooperation is strengthened with the increase of imitation intensities. In addition, high risk and high threshold are in favor of global cooperation.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</originId><author><name>Li, S.</name></author><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/678?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>433e2877</fingerprint><published>1525974003000</published><title>Pitch imperfect</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/678.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7fc:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197417</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197417</originId><author><name>Emelie Perland</name></author><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197417</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>7a6ba41c</fingerprint><published>1525986000000</published><title>Correction: Structural prediction of two novel human atypical SLC transporters, MFSD4A and MFSD9, and their neuroanatomical distribution in mice</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197417</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emelie Perland, Sofie V.

Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations. Chloroform–water partition coefficients derived from the obtained free energies were compared to experimental and previously reported values obtained with the GAFF or the AMBER‐99 force field. The results show that good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the polarization of the electron density by the solvent has been taken into account, and when the energy needed to polarize the electron density of the solute has been considered in the transfer free energy. These results were further confirmed by hydration free energies of polar and aromatic amino acid side chain analogs. Comparison of the two partitioning methods, Hirshfeld‐I and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), revealed some deficiencies in the Hirshfeld‐I method related to the unstable isolated anionic nitrogen pro‐atom used in the method. Hydration free energies and partitioning coefficients obtained with atomic charges from the MBIS partitioning method accounting for polarization by the implicit solvation model are in good agreement with the experimental values. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25347?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>c214e058</fingerprint><published>1526094383000</published><title>Partition coefficients of methylated DNA bases obtained from free energy calculations with molecular electron density derived atomic charges</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Partition coefficients serve in various areas as pharmacology and environmental sciences to predict the hydrophobicity of different substances.

The results show that good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the polarization of the electron density by the solvent has been taken into account, and when the energy needed to polarize the electron density of the solute has been considered in the transfer free energy. These results were further confirmed by hydration free energies of polar and aromatic amino acid side chain analogs. Comparison of the two partitioning methods, Hirshfeld‐I and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), revealed some deficiencies in the Hirshfeld‐I method related to the unstable isolated anionic nitrogen pro‐atom used in the method. Hydration free energies and partitioning coefficients obtained with atomic charges from the MBIS partitioning method accounting for polarization by the implicit solvation model are in good agreement with the experimental values. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1636067cc1a:32b4e7d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04430-2</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04430-2</originId><author><name>Hsinhan Tsai</name></author><crawled>1527672529736</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/KUyQpL2G5Q0/s41467-018-04430-2</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04430-2</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>5bc5de3</fingerprint><published>1527663600000</published><title>Design principles for electronic charge transport in solution-processed vertically stacked 2D perovskite quantum wells</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design principles for electronic charge transport in solution-processed vertically stacked 2D perovskite quantum wells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design principles for electronic charge transport in solution-processed vertically stacked 2D perovskite quantum wells, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04430-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04430-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Solution-processed two-dimensional perovskite quantum-well-based optoelectronic devices have attracted great research interest but their electrical transport is poorly understood.

Here, we present and validate a computational method to predict cohesin-and-CTCF binding sites that form intra-TAD DNA loops. The intra-TAD loop anchors identified are structurally indistinguishable from TAD anchors regarding binding partners, sequence conservation, and resistance to cohesin knockdown; further, the intra-TAD loops retain key functional features of TADs, including chromatin contact insulation, blockage of repressive histone mark spread, and ubiquity across tissues. We propose that intra-TAD loops form by the same loop extrusion mechanism as the larger TAD loops, and that their shorter length enables finer regulatory control in restricting enhancer-promoter interactions, which enables selective, high-level expression of gene targets of super-enhancers and genes located within repressive nuclear compartments. These findings elucidate the role of intra-TAD cohesin-and-CTCF binding in nuclear organization associated with widespread insulation of distal enhancer activity.</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34077</href></item></alternate><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><fingerprint>4313576c</fingerprint><published>1526256000000</published><title>Computational prediction of CTCF/cohesin-based intra-TAD loops that insulate chromatin contacts and gene expression in mouse liver</title><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34077</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>CTCF and cohesin are key drivers of 3D-nuclear organization, anchoring the megabase-scale Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that segment the genome.

One key step in this quality control is assessment of DNA damage: aDNA contains unique signatures of DNA damage that distinguish it from modern DNA, and so analyses of damage patterns can help confirm that DNA sequences obtained are from endogenous aDNA rather than from modern contamination. Predominant signatures of DNA damage include a high frequency of cytosine to thymine substitutions (C-to-T) at the ends of fragments, and elevated rates of purines (A &amp;amp; G) before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Existing QC procedures help assess damage by simply plotting for each sample, the C-to-T mismatch rate along the read and the composition of bases before the 5&apos; strand-breaks. Here we present a more flexible and comprehensive model-based approach to infer and visualize damage patterns in aDNA, implemented in an R package aRchaic. This approach is based on a &amp;quot;grade of membership&amp;quot; model (also known as &amp;quot;admixture&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;topic&amp;quot; model) in which each sample has an estimated grade of membership in each of K damage profiles that are estimated from the data. We illustrate aRchaic on data from several aDNA studies and modern individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. Here, aRchaic clearly distinguishes modern from ancient samples irrespective of DNA extraction, lab and sequencing protocols. Additionally, through an in-silico contamination experiment, we show that the aRchaic grades of membership reflect relative levels of exogenous modern contamination. Together, the outputs of aRchaic provide a concise visual summary of DNA damage patterns, as well as other processes generating mismatches in the data.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1638497eaf3:69a6621:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quality control plays a major role in the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA).

The anti-inflammatory properties of sand fly saliva favor the establishment of the &lt;i&gt;Leishmania infantum&lt;/i&gt; infection. In contrast, an antibody response against &lt;i&gt;Lutzomyia longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; saliva is often associated with a protective cell-mediated response against canine visceral leishmaniasis. Genetic studies may demonstrate to what extent the ability to secrete anti-saliva antibodies depends on genetic or environmental factors. However, the genetic basis of canine antibody response against sand fly saliva has not been assessed. The aim of this study was to identify chromosomal regions associated with the anti-&lt;i&gt;Lu&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;longipalpis&lt;/i&gt; salivary IgG response in 189 dogs resident in endemic areas in order to provide information for prophylactic strategies. Dogs were classified into five groups based on serological and parasitological diagnosis and clinical evaluation. Anti-salivary gland homogenate (SGH) IgG levels were assessed by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples and genotyped using a SNP chip with 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The following linear regression model was fitted: IgG level = mean + origin + sex + age + use of a repellent collar, and the residuals were assumed as pseudo-phenotypes for the association test between phenotypes and genotypes (GWA). A component of variance model that takes into account polygenic and sample structure effects (EMMAX) was employed for GWA. Phenotypic findings indicated that anti-SGH IgG levels remained higher in exposed and subclinically infected dogs than in severely diseased dogs even in regression model residuals. Five associated markers were identified on chromosomes 2, 20 and 31.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05280-0</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05280-0</originId><author><name>Giorgia Guglielmi</name></author><crawled>1527661204435</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05280-0</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><fingerprint>93fa3f09</fingerprint><published>1527577200000</published><title>Who gets credit?

Using genome sequence data from 27 ancient Icelanders, we demonstrate that they are a combination of Norse, Gaelic, and admixed individuals. We further show that these ancient Icelanders are markedly more similar to their source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles than to contemporary Icelanders, who have been shaped by 1100 years of extensive genetic drift.

Using genome sequence data from 27 ancient Icelanders, we demonstrate that they are a combination of Norse, Gaelic, and admixed individuals.

A numerical model [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/05/250662</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Molecular mimicry is the formation of specific molecules by microbial pathogens to avoid recognition and attack by the immune system of the host. Several pathogenic Ascomycota and Zygomycota show such a behaviour by utilizing human complement factor H to hide in the blood stream. We call this type of mimicry molecular crypsis. Such a crypsis can reach a point where the immune system can no longer clearly distinguish between self and non-self cells. Thus, a trade-off between attacking disguised pathogens and erroneously attacking host cells has to be made, which can lead to autoreactivity. Based on signalling theory and protein-interaction modelling, we here present a mathematical model of molecular crypsis of pathogenic fungi using the example of Candida albicans. We tackle the question whether perfect crypsis is feasible, which would imply that protection of human cells by complement factors would be useless. The model identifies pathogen abundance relative to host cell abundance as the predominant factor influencing successful or unsuccessful molecular crypsis. If pathogen cells gain a (locally) quantitative advantage over host cells, even autoreactivity may occur. Our new model enables insights into the mechanisms of candidiasis-induced sepsis and complement associated autoimmune diseases.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163d1c79d83:574fcb2:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Molecular mimicry is the formation of specific molecules by microbial pathogens to avoid recognition and attack by the immune system of the host.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8e:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

Population dynamics in urban and rural areas are different. Understanding factors that contribute to local population changes has various socioeconomic and political implications. In the present study, we use population census data in Japan to examine contributors to the population growth of residential clusters between years 2005 and 2010. The data set covers the entirety of Japan and has a high spatial resolution of 500 × 500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling us to examine population dynamics in various parts of the country (urban and rural) using statistical analysis. We found that, in addition to the area, population density, and age, the shape of the cluster and the spatial distribution of inhabitants within the cluster are significantly related to the population growth rate of a residential cluster. Specifically, the population tends to grow if the cluster is &amp;quot;round&amp;quot; shaped (given the area) and the population is concentrated near the center rather than periphery of the cluster. Combination of the present results and analysis framework with other factors that have been omitted in the present study, such as migration, terrain, and transportation infrastructure, will be fruitful.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee5:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takuya Sekiguchi, Kohei Tamura, Naoki Masuda&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Understanding the maturation of upper limb (UL) movement characteristics in typically developing (TD) children is key to explore UL deficits in those with neurodevelopmental disorders. Three-dimensional motion analysis (3DMA) offers a reliable tool to comprehensively evaluate UL motion. However, studies thus far mainly focused on specific pre-defined parameters extracted from kinematic waveforms. Here, we investigated age-related differences in UL movement characteristics over the entire movement cycle in TD children.&lt;/p&gt; Participants and methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed the non-dominant UL of 60 TD children (mean age 10y3m±3y1m) using 3DMA during eight tasks: reaching (forwards (RF), upwards (RU), sideways (RS)), reach-to-grasp (sphere (RGS), vertical cylinder (RGV)) and activities-of-daily-living mimicking tasks (hand-to-head (HTH), hand-to-mouth (HTM), hand-to-shoulder (HTS)). We investigated differences between four age-groups (5-7y, 8-10y, 11-12y, 13-15y) in: (1) spatiotemporal parameters (movement duration, peak velocity, time-to-peak velocity and trajectory straightness), and (2) 12 UL joint angles, using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found that the 5-7y children moved with lower peak velocity and less straight trajectories compared to the 11-12y group (peak velocity: RS, HTS, p&amp;lt;0.01; trajectory: RU, RS, RGV, HTS, p&amp;lt;0.01) and the 13-15y group (peak velocity: RF, RS, RGS, RGV, HTH, HTS, p&amp;lt;0.01; trajectory, all tasks, p&amp;lt;0.01). The 5-7y children showed increased scapular protraction compared to older children (8-10y and 11-12y, HTS), as well as increased scapular medial rotation compared to the 13-15y group (RGS). During RU, the 5-7y children moved more towards the frontal plane (shoulder), unlike the 13-15y group. Lastly, the 5-7y group used less elbow flexion than older children (11-12y and 13-15y) during HTH and HTS.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our results point toward a maturation in UL movement characteristics up to age 11-12y, when UL motion seemed to reach a plateau. The reference values provided in this study will help to further optimize the interpretation of UL deficits in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f52:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Simon-Martinez, Gabriela Lopes dos Santos, Ellen Jaspers, Ruth Vanderschueren, Lisa Mailleux, Katrijn Klingels, Els Ortibus, Kaat Desloovere, Hilde Feys&lt;/p&gt;

You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

Phosphoinositide (PtdInsP) lipids recruit effector proteins to membranes to mediate a variety of functions including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Each PtdInsP binds to a specific set of effectors through characteristic protein domains such as the PH, FYVE and PX domains. Domains with high affinity for a single PtdInsP species are useful as probes to visualize the distribution and dynamics of that PtdInsP. The endolysosomal system is governed by two primary PtdInsPs: phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], which are thought to localize and control early endosomes and lysosomes/late endosomes, respectively. While PtdIns(3)P has been analysed with mammalian-derived PX and FYVE domains, PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicators remain controversial. Thus, complementary probes against these PtdInsPs are needed, including those originating from non-mammalian proteins. Here, we characterized in mammalian cells the dynamics of the PH domain from PH-containing protein-1 from the parasite &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; (TgPH1), which was previously shown to bind PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. However, we show that TgPH1 retains membrane-binding in PIKfyve-inhibited cells, suggesting that TgPH1 is not a viable PtdIns(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; marker in mammalian cells. Instead, PtdIns(3)P depletion using pharmacological and enzyme-based assays dissociated TgPH1 from membranes. Indeed, TgPH1 co-localized with Rab5-positive early endosomes. In addition, TgPH1 co-localized and behaved similarly to the PX domain of p40phox and FYVE domain of EEA1, which are commonly used as PtdIns(3)P indicators. Collectively, TgPH1 offers a complementary reporter for PtdIns(3)P derived from a non-mammalian protein and that is distinct from commonly employed PX and FYVE domain-based probes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bcc:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Krishna Chintaluri, Brady D.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b0:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Mothers with severe mental illness are vulnerable and engage with services cautiously due to fears of stigma and custody loss. To develop best practice standards and patient-centred services, the subjective experience of those who use it must inform service improvement and policy.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;This study utilised exploratory concurrent mixed methods design with primarily qualitative data. Women admitted between April 2015 and December 2016 to a newly developed psychiatric Mother Baby Unit (MBU) in New Zealand were invited to participate in this study. Qualitative data were collected in three ways: (i) semi-structured interviews incorporating Māori concepts of health and wellness by research assistants near discharge; (ii) invitation to provide anonymous feedback in writing using an open format; (iii) unsolicited verbal feedback provided during a home visit three months after discharge. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Demographic and clinical information was collected prospectively for mother-infant pairs during the course of admission and three months post-discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty-five people participated in the study. High rates of satisfaction were described. Strengths of the service–as perceived by mothers–included co-admission of mother and infant, staff warmth and availability, transparent practice, inclusion of families, and having a comfortable environment. Mothers described intense distress and confusion, as well as negative self-perceptions when acutely unwell. Infant co-admission and the inclusion of partners and other family members alleviated mothers’ distress. Personal attributes of staff, practical support with caregiving, a range of therapeutic approaches and holistic care were all valued. Feedback collected three months after discharge was the most reflective. Significant inter-ethnic differences were not apparent.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The experience of inpatient care can have lasting influence on recovery and wellbeing. Employing a Māori model of health broadened the holistic nature of enquiry. The approach and timing taken in seeking the views of participants’ yielded different information, all of which is of value to service evaluation and refinement. The findings suggest that keeping mothers and infants together during health service utilisation such as MBUs should be a priority for policy makers and service designers. This approach is consistent with Māori values, combining the importance of whānau relationships (kinship), wairua (spiritual connectivity), hinengaro (the mind) and tinana (physical health). These findings suggest that ‘holistic care’–in this case following a Māori holistic health model–is important in mental health settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb926:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tanya Wright, Tanisha Jowsey, Josephine Stanton, Hinemoa Elder, Suzanne Stevens, Trecia A.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A.

Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</content></content></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029431?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029431?af=R</originId><author><name>Sangita Sen</name></author><crawled>1526387566858</crawled><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029431?af=R</href></item></alternate><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><fingerprint>f227f414</fingerprint><published>1526268777000</published><title>Non-perturbative calculation of orbital and spin effects in molecules subject to non-uniform magnetic fields</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16363c9e90a:38e65a0:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</originId><author><name>Florian Setzer</name></author><updated>1528146000000</updated><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>fa7f5e14</fingerprint><published>1528146000000</published><title>Characterization of the seven-day course of pulmonary response following unilateral lung acid injury in rats</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198440</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Setzer, Barbara Schmidt, Lars Hueter, Konrad Schwarzkopf, Jörg Sänger, Torsten Schreiber&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Aspiration of gastric acid is an important cause of acute lung injury. The time course of the pulmonary response to such an insult beyond the initial 48 hours is incompletely characterized. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively describe the pulmonary effects of focal lung acid injury over a seven day period in both directly injured and not directly injured lung tissue.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Male Wistar rats underwent left-endobronchial instillation with hydrochloric acid and were sacrificed at 4, 24, 48, 96 or 168 h after the insult. Healthy non-injured animals served as controls. We assessed inflammatory cell counts and cytokine levels in right and left lung lavage fluid and blood, arterial oxygen tension, alterations in lung histology, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio and differential lung perfusion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Lung acid instillation induced an early strong inflammatory response in the directly affected lung, peaking at 4–24 hours, with only partial resolution after 7 days. A less severe response with complete resolution after 4 days was seen in the opposite lung. Alveolar cytokine levels, with exception of IL-6, only partially reflected the localization of lung injury and the time course of the functional and histologic alterations. Alveolar leucocyte subpopulations exhibited different time courses in the acid injured lung with persistent elevation of alveolar lymphocytes and macrophages. After acid instillation there was an early transient decrease in arterial oxygen tension and lung perfusion was preferentially distributed to the non-injured lung.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These findings provide a basis for further research in the field of lung acid injury and for studies exploring effects of mechanical ventilation on injured lungs. Incomplete recovery in the directly injured lung 7 days after acid instillation suggests that increased vulnerability and susceptibility to further noxious stimuli are still present at that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b78c:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Setzer, Barbara Schmidt, Lars Hueter, Konrad Schwarzkopf, Jörg Sänger, Torsten Schreiber&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the prognosis after early MRI on clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, hypothesising that MRI pathology is associated with more disability and that MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures are associated with slower return to work (RTW).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a follow-up study of a cohort of 469 patients, who were scanned in the period 2006 to 2010. The respondents constituted our cohort for disability analysis and the subset that was in the labour market at the time of the trauma constituted our sub-cohort for RTW analysis. Questionnaires included disability scores, job title, and lifestyle factors. Job titles were linked with a job exposure matrix to estimate occupational exposures. Register information was obtained on time until RTW. We used logistic regression analysis of disability and Cox regression analysis of time until RTW.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The proportion that responded was 53% (249/469) for the disability analysis and 59% (125/212) for the RTW analysis. The mean age at follow up was 43.5 years, the mean time since trauma was 4.8 years, 53% had injury of the dominant hand, and 54% had MRI pathology. Men constituted 43% of the cohort and 56% of the sub-cohort. MRI pathology was not associated with more disability [e.g., for a &apos;Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand&apos;-score ≥20 the odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.26–1.17)]. Patients without MRI pathology and with low occupational exposures were off work for an average of four weeks.

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f81:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felise G.

While the pattern of cell division has specific rules for healthy development, some fluctuations for this pattern are allowable. In order to uncover this robust mechanism of development, the position of cells in each embryo must be analyzed quantitatively. In the embryonic developmental biology, various studies are attempted to acquire the quantitative criteria from time-series three-dimensional microscopic images by image analysis such as segmentation, to understand the mechanism of development. Unfortunately, due to the fact of inaccuracy of nuclei detection and segmentation, it is a hard task to evaluate an embryo quantitatively from bioimages automatically. Based on these demands of quantitative analysis, we developed QCA Net, which accurately performs nuclear segmentation of three-dimensional fluorescence microscopic images for early-stage mouse embryos. QCA Net is based on Convolutional Neural Network. We trained QCA Net using a part of one early-stage mouse embryo. As a test, QCA Net performed segmentation of different 11 mouse embryos images. We succeeded in accurately acquiring the shape of the nucleus without fusion of nuclear regions. Besides, we achieved accurate extraction of the time-series data of nuclear number, volume, surface area, and center of gravity coordinates as the quantitative criteria of mouse development, from the segmentation images acquired by QCA Net. To our surprise, these results suggested that QCA Net recognized and distinguished the nucleus and a polar body formed in meiosis process. We consider that QCA Net can drastically contribute to performing segmentation of various bioimages in the embryonic developmental biology. The various quantitative criteria obtained from segmented images can uncover various unknown mechanisms of embryonic development, such as the robust mechanism of development.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636f4104eb:4ba4834:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Multicellular organisms develop from the fertilized eggs through numbers of cell divisions.

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values represent a widely used, but pervasively misunderstood and fiercely contested method of scientific inference. Display items, such as figures and tables, often containing the main results, are an important source of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. We conducted a survey comparing the overall use of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and the occurrence of significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items of a sample of articles in the three top multidisciplinary journals (Nature, Science, PNAS) in 2017 and, respectively, in 1997. We also examined the reporting of multiplicity corrections and its potential influence on the proportion of statistically significant &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values. Our findings demonstrated substantial and growing reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in display items, with increases of 2.5 to 14.5 times in 2017 compared to 1997. The overwhelming majority of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values (94%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 92% to 96%) were statistically significant. Methods to adjust for multiplicity were almost non-existent in 1997, but reported in many articles relying on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values in 2017 (Nature 68%, Science 48%, PNAS 38%). In their absence, almost all reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant (98%, 95% CI 96% to 99%). Conversely, when any multiplicity corrections were described, 88% (95% CI 82% to 93%) of reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were statistically significant. Use of Bayesian methods was scant (2.5%) and rarely (0.7%) articles relied exclusively on Bayesian statistics. Overall, wider appreciation of the need for multiplicity corrections is a welcome evolution, but the rapid growth of reliance on &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values and implausibly high rates of reported statistical significance are worrisome.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ioana Alina Cristea, John P.

FtsZ, the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, has been recently shown to engage in intriguing treadmilling dynamics along the circumference of the division plane. When coreconstituted in vitro with FtsA, one of its natural membrane anchors, on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices compatible with treadmilling of curved polar filaments. Replacing FtsA by a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) to FtsZ, we have discovered conditions for the formation of dynamic rings, showing that the phenomenon is intrinsic to FtsZ. Ring formation is only observed for a narrow range of protein concentrations at the bilayer, which is highly modulated by free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and depends upon guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Interestingly, the direction of rotation can be reversed by switching the mts from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the protein, implying that the filament attachment must have a perpendicular component to both curvature and polarity. Remarkably, this chirality switch concurs with previously shown inward or outward membrane deformations by the respective FtsZ mutants. Our results lead us to suggest an intrinsic helicity of FtsZ filaments with more than one direction of curvature, supporting earlier hypotheses and experimental evidence.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TcroNLOHfIw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16374585b53:17f2a:ae8b474d</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c8:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd80:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mariel J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL-TL) was proposed as a biomarker of cancer risk. Recent scientific evidence suggested PBL-TL plays a diverse role in different cancers. Inconsistent results were obtained on PBL-TL in relation to breast cancer risk and specifically to the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The aim of the present case-control study was to analyse the correlation between family history of breast cancer or presence of a BRCA mutation and PBL-TL in the hypothesis that TL is a modifier of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PBL-TL was measured using the real-time quantitative PCR method in DNA for 142 cases and 239 controls. All the women enrolled were characterized for cancer family history. A subgroup of 48 women were classified for the presence of a BRCA mutation. PBL-TL were summarized as means and standard deviations, and compared by standard analysis of variance. A multivariable Generalised Linear Model was fitted to the data with PBL-TL as the dependent variable, case/control status and presence of a BRCA/VUS mutation as factors, and age in 4 strata as a covariate.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Age was significantly associated with decreasing PBL-TL in controls (p = 0.01), but not in BC cases. The telomere length is shorter in cases than in controls after adjusting for age. No effect on PBL-TL of BMI, smoke nor of the most common risk factors for breast cancer was observed. No association between PBL-TL and family history was detected both in BC cases and controls. In the multivariate model, no association was observed between BRCA mutation and decreased PBL-TL. A statistically significant interaction (p = 0.031) between case-control status and a BRCA-mutation/VUS was observed, but no effect was detected for the interaction of cancer status and BRCA or VUS.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study fails to provide support to the hypothesis that PBL-TL is associated with the risk of hereditary BC, or that is a marker of inherited mutations in BRCA genes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Pavanello, Liliana Varesco, Viviana Gismondi, Paolo Bruzzi, Claudia Bolognesi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Genetic variants of inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) that confer reduced ITPase activity are associated with protection against ribavirin(RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia in peginterferon(IFN)/RBV-based treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with reduced ITPase activity showed improved treatment efficacy when treated with IFN/RBV. In addition, a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene is associated with an improved response to IFN/RBV treatment. RBV has been an important component of IFN-containing regimens, and is currently recommended in combination with several IFN-free regimens for treatment of harder to cure HCV infections.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether genetic variations that reduce ITPase activity impact RBV-induced anemia in IFN-free/RBV regimens&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, genetic analyses were conducted in the PEARL-IV trial to investigate the effect of activity-reducing ITPA variants as well as IL28B polymorphism on anemia, platelet (PLT) counts, and virologic response in HCV genotype1a-infected patients treated with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir±RBV.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Reduction in ITPase activity and homozygosity for the IL28Brs12979860 CC genotype protected against RBV-induced anemia. In patients receiving RBV, reduced ITPase activity was associated with reduced plasma RBV concentration and higher PLT counts. ITPase activity had no impact on response to DAA treatment, viral kinetics, or baseline IP-10 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that genetics of ITPA and IL28B may help identify patients protected from RBV-induced anemia when treated with IFN-free regimens. Our work demonstrates for the first time that IL28B genetics may also have an impact on RBV-induced anemia. This may be of particular significance in patients with difficult-to-cure HCV infections, such as patients with decompensated cirrhosis where RBV-containing regimens likely will continue to be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94e:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aparna Vasanthakumar, Justin W.

We found that selection predictably favors different risk-taking behaviors under different treatments: Exploratory behavior is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, selection on behavior is stronger than selection on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that selection can shape behavioral traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03302</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03302</originId><author><name>Shohei Kakinuma, Hideaki Shirota</name></author><crawled>1527266044129</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03302/20180525/images/medium/jp-2018-03302f_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03302&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee8:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

There are no defined correlates of protection for any intracellular pathogen, including the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, which causes tularemia. Evaluating vaccine efficacy against sporadic diseases like tularemia using field trials is problematic, and therefore alternative strategies to test vaccine candidates like the &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; Live Vaccine Strain (LVS), such as testing in animals and applying correlate measurements, are needed. Recently, we described a promising correlate strategy that predicted the degree of vaccine-induced protection in mice given parenteral challenges, primarily when using an attenuated &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; strain. Here, we demonstrate that using peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in this approach predicts LVS-mediated protection against respiratory challenge of Fischer 344 rats with fully virulent &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;, with exceptional sensitivity and specificity. Rats were vaccinated with a panel of LVS-derived vaccines and subsequently given lethal respiratory challenges with Type A &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tularensis&lt;/i&gt;. In parallel, PBLs from vaccinated rats were evaluated for their functional ability to control intramacrophage &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; growth in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; co-culture assays. PBLs recovered from co-cultures were also evaluated for relative gene expression using a large panel of genes identified in murine studies. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; control of LVS intramacrophage replication reflected the hierarchy of protection. Further, despite variability between individuals, 22 genes were significantly more up-regulated in PBLs from rats vaccinated with LVS compared to those from rats vaccinated with the variant LVS-R or heat-killed LVS, which were poorly protective. These genes included IFN-γ, IL-21, NOS2, LTA, T-bet, IL-12rβ2, and CCL5. Most importantly, combining quantifications of intramacrophage growth control with 5–7 gene expression levels using multivariate analyses discriminated protected from non-protected individuals with greater than 95% sensitivity and specificity. The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd86:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Roberto De Pascalis, Andrew Hahn, Helen M.

The results therefore support translation of this approach to non-human primates and people to evaluate new vaccines against &lt;i&gt;Francisella&lt;/i&gt; and other intracellular pathogens.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</originId><author><name>Samuel K.

Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyse protein cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chain of a glutamine residue on one protein and the side chain of a lysine residue on another. Generally, TGases show low substrate specificity with respect to their amine substrate, such that a wide variety of primary amines can participate in the modification of specific glutamine residue. Although a number of different TGases have been used to mediate these bioconjugation reactions, the TGase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (bTG) may be particularly suited to this application. It is smaller than most TGases, can be expressed in a soluble active form, and lacks the calcium dependence of its mammalian counterparts. However, little is known regarding this enzyme and its glutamine substrate specificity, limiting the scope of its application. In this work, we designed a FRET-based ligation assay to monitor the bTG-mediated conjugation of the fluorescent proteins Clover and mRuby2. This assay allowed us to screen a library of random heptapeptide glutamine sequences for their reactivity with recombinant bTG in bacterial cells, using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. From this library, several reactive sequences were identified and kinetically characterized, with the most reactive sequence (YAHQAHY) having a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19 ± 3 μM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This sequence was then genetically appended onto a test protein as a reactive ‘Q-tag’ and fluorescently labelled with dansyl-cadaverine, in the first demonstration of protein labelling mediated by bTG.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb917:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel K.

Studies in sentiment analysis and opinion mining have been focused on many aspects related to opinions, namely polarity classification by making use of positive, negative or neutral values.

Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Manuel Gálvez, Daniel Castillo, Luis Javier Herrera, Belén San Román, Olga Valenzuela, Francisco Manuel Ortuño, Ignacio Rojas&lt;/p&gt;

A growing literature has been developed demonstrating the clinical relevance of a biomathematical model, the Proliferation-Invasion (PI) model, of glioblastoma growth. Of interest here is the development of a treatment response metric, Days Gained (DG). This metric is based on individual tumor kinetics estimated through segmented volumes of hyperintense regions on T1-weighted gadolinium enhanced (T1Gd) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). This metric was shown to be prognostic of time to progression. Further, it was shown to be more prognostic of outcome than standard response metrics. While promising, the original paper did not account for uncertainty in the calculation of the DG metric leaving the robustness of this cutoff in question. We harness the Bayesian framework to consider the impact of two sources of uncertainty: 1) image acquisition and 2) interobserver error in image segmentation. We first utilize synthetic data to characterize what non-error variants are influencing the final uncertainty in the DG metric. We then consider the original patient cohort to investigate clinical patterns of uncertainty and to determine how robust this metric is for predicting time to progression and overall survival. Our results indicate that the key clinical variants are the time between pre-treatment images and the underlying tumor growth kinetics, matching our observations in the clinical cohort. Finally, we demonstrated that for this cohort there was a continuous range of cutoffs between 94 and 105 for which the prediction of the time to progression and was over 80\% reliable. While further validation must be done, this work represents a key step in ascertaining the clinical utility of this metric.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163705c2050:4be8b9f:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Glioblastomas, lethal primary brain tumors, are known for their heterogeneity and invasiveness.

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PmCDC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PmCyclin B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful.

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PmCDC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PmCyclin B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline. These data suggest that PmChk1 may have important roles in the ovarian maturation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01420</link><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01420</originId><author><name>Liping Han, Tao Guo, Zhen Guo, Caifen Wang, Wei Zhang, Shailendra Shakya, Huanyu Ding, Haiyan Li, Xu Xu, Yujie Ren, Jiwen Zhang</name></author><crawled>1526055088873</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01420/20180511/images/medium/jp-2018-014208_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01420&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Over the last decades, the treatment of schizophrenia has shifted fundamentally from a focus on symptom reduction to a focus on recovery and improving aspects of functioning. In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

In this study, we examined the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on social cognitive and nonsocial neurocognitive functions, as well as on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures, in individuals with schizophrenia. Thirty-seven individuals with schizophrenia were administered one of three different tDCS conditions (cathodal, anodal, and sham) per visit over the course of three visits, with approximately one week between each visit. Order of conditions was randomized and counterbalanced across subjects. For the active conditions, the electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the reference electrode over right supraorbital cortex. Current intensity was 2 mA and was maintained for two 20-minute sessions, with a one hour break between the sessions. Assessments were conducted immediately following each session, in a counterbalanced order of administration. No systematic effects were found across the social and nonsocial cognitive domains, and no significant effects were detected on event-related potentials (ERPs). The very small effect sizes, further validated by &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt; power analyses (large Critical Ns), demonstrated that these findings were not due to lack of statistical power. Except for mild local discomfort, no significant side effects were reported. Findings demonstrate the safety and ease of administration of this procedure, but suggest that a single dose of tDCS over these areas does not yield a therapeutic effect on cognition in schizophrenia.

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids.

Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Last few decades have witnessed an exponential growth of biomedical literature investigating the impact of spices and herbs on health, presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation of empirical evidence to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Our study provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in underlying molecular mechanisms.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0028-4</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0028-4</originId><author><name>Renée Beekman</name></author><crawled>1526931025783</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/11hfXucojho/s41591-018-0028-4</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0028-4</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>5dc0da96</fingerprint><published>1526886000000</published><title>The reference epigenome and regulatory chromatin landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>20</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reference epigenome and regulatory chromatin landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reference epigenome and regulatory chromatin landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0028-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0028-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An integrated resource of (epi)genomic features in annotated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primary samples uncovers subgroup-specific regulatory alterations associated with clinical behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/11hfXucojho&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><width>494</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0028-4/MediaObjects/41591_2018_28_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163842e6f77:659aa1b:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The reference epigenome and regulatory chromatin landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reference epigenome and regulatory chromatin landscape of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0028-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0028-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;An integrated resource of (epi)genomic features in annotated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) primary samples uncovers subgroup-specific regulatory alterations associated with clinical behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/11hfXucojho&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332510v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332510v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Tran, L.</name></author><crawled>1527521223516</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/332510v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>686077a</fingerprint><published>1527490800000</published><title>ProfPPIdb: pairs of physical protein-protein interactions predicted for entire proteomes [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/28/332510</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in many cellular processes. Most annotations of PPIs mix experimental and computational data. The mix optimizes coverage, but obfuscates the annotation origin. Some resources excel at focusing on reliable experimental data. Here, we focused on new pairs of interacting proteins for several model organisms based solely on sequence-based prediction methods. Results: We extracted reliable experimental data about which proteins interact (binary) for eight diverse model organisms from public databases, namely from Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Plasmodium falciparum, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and for the previously used Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Those data were the base to develop a PPI prediction method for each model organism. The method used evolutionary information through a profile-kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM). With the resulting eight models, we predicted all possible protein pairs in each organism and made the top predictions available through a web application. Almost all of the PPIs made available were predicted between proteins that have not been observed in any interaction, in particular for less well-studied organisms. Thus, our work complements existing resources and is particularly helpful for designing experiments because of its uniqueness. Experimental annotations and computational predictions are strongly influenced by the fact that some proteins have many partners and others few. To optimize machine learning, the newly methods explicitly ignored such a network-structure and rely either on domain knowledge or sequence-only methods.

Mouse models of breast cancer with specific molecular subtypes (e.g., ER or HER2 positive) in an immunocompetent or an immunocompromised environment significantly contribute to our understanding of cancer biology, despite some limitations, and they give insight into targeted therapies. However, an ideal triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse model is lacking. What has been missing in the TNBC mouse model is a sequential progression of the disease in an essential native microenvironment. This notion inspired us to develop a TNBC-model in syngeneic mice using a mammary intraductal (MIND) method. To achieve this goal, Mvt-1and 4T1 TNBC mouse cell lines were injected into the mammary ducts via nipples of FVB/N mice and BALB/c wild-type immunocompetent mice, respectively. We established that the TNBC-MIND model in syngeneic mice could epitomize all breast cancer progression stages and metastasis into the lungs via lymphatic or hematogenous dissemination within four weeks. Collectively, the syngeneic mouse-TNBC-MIND model may serve as a unique platform for further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of TNBC growth and therapies.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c24:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arnab Ghosh, Sandipto Sarkar, Snigdha Banerjee, Fariba Behbod, Ossama Tawfik, Douglas McGregor, Stephanie Graff, Sushanta K.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Patients who have incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and an estimated intermediate risk (5–60%) of lung cancer frequently are followed via computed tomography (CT) surveillance to detect nodule growth, despite guidelines for a more aggressive diagnostic strategy. We examined the cost-effectiveness of an autoantibody test (AABT)—Early Cancer Detection Test-Lung (EarlyCDT-Lung&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;)—as an aid to early diagnosis of lung cancer among such patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate use of the AABT versus CT surveillance alone. In the model, patients with a positive AABT—because they are at substantially enhanced risk of lung cancer—are assumed to go directly to biopsy, resulting in diagnosis of lung cancer in earlier stages than under current guidelines (a beneficial stage shift). Patients with a negative AABT, and those scheduled for CT surveillance alone, are assumed to have periodic CT screenings to detect rapid growth and thus to have their lung cancers diagnosed—on average—at more advanced stages.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 1,000 patients who have incidentally detected nodules 8–30 mm, have an intermediate-risk of lung cancer, and are evaluated by CT surveillance alone, 95 (9.5%) are assumed to have lung cancer (local, 73.6%; regional, 22.0%; distant, 4.4%). With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 41%/93% (stage shift = 10.8%), although expected costs would be higher by $949,442 ($949 per person), life years would be higher by 53 (0.05 per person), resulting in a cost per life-year gained of $18,029 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $24,330. With use of the AABT set at a sensitivity/specificity of 28%/98% (stage shift = 7.4%), corresponding cost-effectiveness ratios would be $18,454 and $24,833.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Under our base-case assumptions, and reasonable variations thereof, using AABT as an aid in the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with incidentally detected pulmonary nodules who are estimated to be at intermediate risk of lung cancer and are scheduled for CT surveillance alone is likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by John Edelsberg, Derek Weycker, Mark Atwood, Geoffrey Hamilton-Fairley, James R.

Global trade and the movement of people accelerate biological invasions by spreading species worldwide. Biosecurity measures seek to allow trade and passenger movements while preventing incursions that could lead to the establishment of unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. However, few data exist to evaluate whether changes in trade volumes, passenger arrivals, and biosecurity measures have altered rates of establishment of nonnative species over time. This is particularly true for pathogens, which pose significant risks to animal and plant health and are consequently a major focus of biosecurity efforts but are difficult to detect. Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163b75886ca:c89e4:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin A.

Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197779</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197779</originId><author><name>Bruno Zappone</name></author><updated>1527282000000</updated><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197779</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>973aa3f1</fingerprint><published>1527282000000</published><title>Transient viscous response of the human cornea probed with the Surface Force Apparatus</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197779</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Zappone, Navinkumar J.

Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the human cornea is crucial for understanding the development of corneal diseases and impact of surgical treatments (e.g., corneal laser surgery, corneal cross-linking). Using a Surface Force Apparatus we investigated the transient viscous response of the anterior cornea from donor human eyes compressed between macroscopic crossed cylinders. Corneal biomechanics was analyzed using linear viscoelastic theory and interpreted in the framework of a biphasic model of soft hydrated porous tissues, including a significant contribution from the pressurization and viscous flow of fluid within the corneal tissue. Time-resolved measurements of tissue deformation and careful determination of the relaxation time provided an elastic modulus in the range between 0.17 and 1.43 MPa, and fluid permeability of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/(N∙s). The permeability decreased as the deformation was increased above a strain level of about 10%, indicating that the interstitial space between fibrils of the corneal stromal matrix was reduced under the effect of strong compression. This effect may play a major role in determining the observed rate-dependent non-linear stress-strain response of the anterior cornea, which underlies the shape and optical properties of the tissue.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd75:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Zappone, Navinkumar J.

Taro, &lt;i&gt;Colocasia esculenta&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Schott, is a vegetable and starchy root crop cultivated in Asia, Oceania, the Americas, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Very little is known about its early history in the Mediterranean, which previous authors have sought to trace through Classical (Greek and Latin) texts that record the name &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; (including cognates) from the 3rd century BC onwards. In ancient literature, however, this name also refers to the sacred lotus, &lt;i&gt;Nelumbo nucifera&lt;/i&gt; Gaertn. and its edible rhizome. Like taro, lotus is an alien introduction to the Mediterranean, and there has been considerable confusion regarding the true identity of plants referred to as &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; in ancient literature. Another early name used to indicate taro was &lt;i&gt;arum&lt;/i&gt;, a name already attested from the 4th century BC. Today, this name refers to &lt;i&gt;Arum&lt;/i&gt;, an aroid genus native to West Asia, Europe, and the Mediterranean. Our aim is to explore historical references to taro in order to clarify when and through which routes this plant reached the Mediterranean. To investigate Greek and Latin texts, we performed a search using the &lt;i&gt;Thesaurus Linguae Graecae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TLG&lt;/i&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TLL&lt;/i&gt;), plus commentaries and English and French translations of original texts. Results show that while in the early Greek and Latin literature the name &lt;i&gt;kolokasia&lt;/i&gt; (Greek κολοκάσια) and its Latin equivalent &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; refer to &lt;i&gt;Nelumbo nucifera&lt;/i&gt; Gaertn., after the 4th century AD a poorly understood linguistic shift occurs, and &lt;i&gt;colocasia&lt;/i&gt; becomes the name for taro.

In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, this promise is even greater due to the relatively small cellular size (302 cells) of the nervous system. While the adult C. elegans connectome has been characterized, the emergence of these networks in development has yet to be established. In this paper, we approach this problem using secondary data describing the birth times of terminally-differentiated cells as they appear in the embryo and connectomics data for nervous system cells in the adult hermaphrodite. By combining these two sources of data, we can better understand patterns that emerge in an incipient connectome.

In the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, this promise is even greater due to the relatively small cellular size (302 cells) of the nervous system. While the adult C. elegans connectome has been characterized, the emergence of these networks in development has yet to be established. In this paper, we approach this problem using secondary data describing the birth times of terminally-differentiated cells as they appear in the embryo and connectomics data for nervous system cells in the adult hermaphrodite. By combining these two sources of data, we can better understand patterns that emerge in an incipient connectome. This includes identifying at what point in embryogenesis the cells of a connectome first comes into being, observing some of the earliest neuron-neuron interactions, and making comparisons between the formally-defined connectome and the embryogenetic interactome.

Med. Chem. on “&lt;em&gt;What Makes a Great Medicinal Chemist&lt;/em&gt;“. As he makes clear from the beginning, if you’ve been doing this stuff for a while, you’ve likely heard many of these recommendations before. But it’s useful for people starting out, and it’s also useful for organization to think about what they’re encouraging (and what they’re not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several characteristics common to good scientists in general – paraphrasing, we have: (1) intellectual curiosity, (2) ability to focus on the problem at hand, (3) pragmatic approach to problem-solving, (4) respect for data, (5) attention to detail, (6) sense of urgency, (7) awareness of other work in the field, (8) openness to new technologies (once they’ve proved their utility!), (9) willingness to challenge assumptions and ditch old ones, (10) enjoyment of their work, (11) awareness of the limits of their knowledge, (12) resiliency, (13) effective at communication, (14) working well with team members (there are exceptions!), (15) not constantly seeking credit, and (16) looking for mentors early on, and serving as one later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past that, he has traits that are more specific to medicinal chemists: (17) never losing sight of the final drug profile, (18) the ability to come up with unusual structural ideas when needed, (19) attention to more than just potency, (20) three-dimensional thinking, (21) awareness of the need for different chemical series/scaffolds, (22) awareness of the competition, but not being scared of IP space, (23) never giving on validated targets, since they’re rare, (24) a deep understanding of biology, (25) decisiveness about what the next steps in a project should be, (26) being unafraid of tough chemistry (in a good cause), (27) a willingness to repurpose anything (in a good cause), and (28) awareness of the history of the field and its current state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a list! And it should be clear at the outset that you’re not going to find people – or not too many – who have all those qualities turned up to 11. But they’re all useful and important, and it’s worth looking over them to see what your strengths are (and especially what you might need to shore up a bit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few comments on specific items: I think that (3), (9), and (27) are aspects of the same approach to applied research – that is, a willingness to go with what works, even if it isn’t your idea, even if it disproves your favorite assumptions, even if it seems weird or even if it seems obvious or old. Things that work, that really work, are the ace cards in the deck. Solid experimental evidence brushes aside feelings, theories, and assumptions (quality 4 above ), and you have to be ready to come to terms with it and figure out where it’s telling you to go next (quality 25). A corollary is that if you’re running experiments whose results are not going to be solid or important enough for you to base such decisions on, then why? We’ve all sat in meetings where someone outlines an experiment that (if it works) means the project goes on as planned. But if it doesn’t work? Then. . .the project goes on as planned anyway. It’s hard to see how that’s not, at some level, a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also has a connection with (11), knowing what you don’t know. There are mistakes at both ends of the scale (there always are), and in this case it’s being too tentative or being too confident. Chemists, in my experience, are more prone to the latter, the mistake the Greeks called &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt;. Anyone who’s honest with themselves about biomedical research has to admit that most of the time, about most things, we can only aspire to the level of actually knowing jack diddley. What really causes Alzheimer’s? What are the specific neuronal processes involved in consciousness? What’s the specific molecular process you’d need to hit to stop multiple sclerosis or lupus? On a more immediate level, why does Compound Series A get into cells while Compound Series B doesn’t? What do I need to do to the lead compound to make it about two times more potent at the target? Or about ten times less potent at that other target it’s hitting? What other targets is the thing hitting, anyway? And so on. Decision-making under these conditions is. . .nontrivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why many of the desirable qualities above can in fact work against each other, if taken to extremes or misapplied. Attention to detail is important – but not to the point where you become unable to make a call because you can think of bad consequences every way you turn. Ability to focus is important, but not if it leads to glossing over key experimental data that are trying to tell you something. Mistakes at both ends of the scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(24), understanding of biology, deserves some comment. My feeling is that not many people from other fields tend to know much about organic or medicinal chemistry, nor do they seem particularly eager to learn. So we chemists have a real advantage, knowing this stuff already, but you can’t rest on that advantage, either. The point is to start from there and &lt;em&gt;go learn about the other stuff&lt;/em&gt;. You can be useful as a chemist (at an entry-level position) without knowing much about the biology involved – just bang out compounds. But you cannot be really good at the job with that approach, nor (as time goes on) will you continue to be as valuable to your employer – or any other employer. The chemistry is just a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quality worth noting is (12), resilience. A constant feature of drug research is that most things, most of the time, don’t work that well. Your ideas about improving the compounds? By golly, here come the assay data, and it’s back to the bench we go. You have to be ready for your best ideas, your biggest bolts of inspiration, to land in a tangled heap over and over. It takes getting used to, and some personality types are just not suited to it. Longterm med-chemists exhibit survivorship bias; they’re the ones who have been able to deal, but not everyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been focusing on individual behavior, but as mentioned above, there’s something to be said about organizations, too. Managers of all types should think about whether their labs, departments, or companies are providing a good home for these behaviors or not. Be honest. I’m not talking about wall posters, e-mail newsletters, or “State of the Company” speeches. Your mission statement might say that you’re committed to innovation or something, but talk is as cheap as it’s ever been. For employees looking at their own management, my advice is always this: don’t pay so much attention to what they say, but rather &lt;em&gt;watch what they do&lt;/em&gt;. Don’t read the slogans on the intranet pages – pay attention and &lt;em&gt;watch what behaviors your company actually rewards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they’re valuing the sorts of things on Murcko’s list, that’s good news. But if they’re not, they may be rewarding some less worthwhile behaviors, like delivering on deadline even if it means delivering crap, whacking people on the head for coming up with inconvenient data or ideas, advancing projects based more on who proposed them than intrinsic merit, etc. There’s a whole Devil’s Dictionary/Screwtape Letters list of things that good medicinal chemists and scientists &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do, and you need to be alert to their presence, too. The devil finds work for idle hands, and for empty heads, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</originId><author><name>Xi Chen</name></author><updated>1527195600000</updated><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>e35dcf06</fingerprint><published>1527195600000</published><title>Propofol elicits autophagy via endoplasmic reticulum stress and calcium exchange in C2C12 myoblast cell line</title><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xi Chen, Long-Yun Li, Jin-Lan Jiang, Kai Li, Zhen-Bo Su, Fu-Qiang Zhang, Wen-Jing Zhang, Guo-Qing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;
In this study, we investigated the relationship between propofol and autophagy and examined whether this relationship depends on ER stress, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and disruption of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis. To this end, we measured C2C12 cell apoptosis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, along with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels; ROS production; and expression of proteins and genes associated with autophagy, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and ER stress, including LC3 (microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3), p62, AMPK (adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), phosphorylated mTOR, CHOP (C/BEP homologous protein), and Grp78/Bip (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). We found that propofol treatment induced autophagy, ER stress, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. The ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to AMPK increased, whereas the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR to mTOR decreased. Collectively, the data suggested that propofol induced autophagy &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through ER stress, resulting in elevated ROS and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3a:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

main-edge and post-edge are attributed to the so-called competing quantum effects, under which
both the weak and well-formed H-bonds are promoted.

protons increase the fluctuations on the intramolecular covalency and broaden the pre-edge of the
spectra. For intermediate-range and long-range orderings, the observed red and blue shifts of the
main-edge and post-edge are attributed to the so-called competing quantum effects, under which
both the weak and well-formed H-bonds are promoted. The theoretical spectra are in nearly quantitative agreement with the available experimental data.</content></summary><unread>True</unread><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1634a8d7137:1400fcd:3dd877af</id></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</originId><author><name>Dustin C.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP. As a novel approach employing recombinantly expressed PrP and intein-mediated protein ligation, we used N-PrP covalently coupled to beads as a bait for affinity purification. N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions. Moreover, some interactors were found only in either non-AD or AD brain, suggesting aberrant PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; interactions in the pathogenesis of AD.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232b:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Ulbrich, Petra Janning, Ralf Seidel, Jakob Matschke, Anika Gonsberg, Sebastian Jung, Markus Glatzel, Martin Engelhard, Konstanze F.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis.

Background &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and life-limiting condition. From a healthcare perspective it is vital to establish effective methods of improving the quality of remaining life in these patients. This requires a detailed understanding of the multiple impacts of an IPF diagnosis on the individual.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We sought to understand how patients coped with their initial diagnosis, how they live with the disease day-to-day, and their experiences and opinions of the professional support they receive. A patient-centred approach was used to explore the social, psychological and physical impacts of IPF. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by an experienced academic. Interview questions were written by the researchers but guided by informal conversations with patients and clinicians. An inductive thematic approach was used to analyse the data, allowing us to identify common themes in the patients’ experiences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of fifty invited participants, ten took part in the study (aged 53–81 years; 9 male). Inductive analysis of interviews identified seven second-order themes and eleven first-order themes, represented by two General Dimensions: ‘&lt;i&gt;Patient experience with the condition’&lt;/i&gt; and ‘&lt;i&gt;Patient-led recommendations for practice’&lt;/i&gt;. The key message on ‘coping’ in these patients was that acceptance of their condition led to a sense of optimism. Participants reported using appraisal-focused coping strategies to change their perspectives (thinking positively) and emotion-focused strategies to overcome depression (the main opportunity for emotional expression being an IPF support group). The support group also facilitated problem-focused coping: individuals exchanged knowledge and experience and gave one another tips on how to live with their condition.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Health professionals should provide patients with information that focuses on &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt; with IPF, encouraging them to make lifestyle changes and adaptations to improve quality of life. Family members should receive education about IPF so that they can support such changes. Patients should be encouraged to join a support group and to participate in physical activity (again preferably group-based). This study offers novel findings that will help inform much-needed changes in the practice of supporting IPF patients to cope with their diagnosis and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sameera Senanayake, Kim Harrison, Michael Lewis, Melitta McNarry, Joanne Hudson&lt;/p&gt;

Although several algorithms for analysing multi-omic data exist, no study has yet performed a detailed comparison of these methods in biologically relevant contexts. Here we present and benchmark a novel tensorial independent component analysis (tICA) algorithm against current state-of-the-art methods. Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75$\%$ of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163506186b5:1e2a223:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data.

The tertiary structure of proteins has been represented as a network, in which residues are nodes and their contacts are edges. Protein structure networks contain residues, called hubs or central, which are essential to form short connection pathways between any pair of nodes. Hence hub residues may effectively spread structural perturbations through the protein. To test whether modifications nearby to hub residues could affect the enzyme active site, mutations were introduced in the β-glycosidase Sfβgly (PDB-ID: 5CG0) directed to residues that form an α-helix (260–265) and a β-strand (335–337) close to one of its main hub residues, F251, which is approximately 14 Å from the Sfβgly active site. Replacement of residues A263 and A264, which side-chains project from the α-helix towards F251, decreased the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Mutation A263F was shown to weaken noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization within the Sfβgly active site. Mutations placed on the opposite side of the same α-helix did not show these effects. Consistently, replacement of V336, which side-chain protrudes from a β-strand face towards F251, inactivated Sfβgly. Next to V336, mutation S337F also caused a decrease in noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization. Therefore, we suggest that mutations A263F, A264F, V336F and S337F may directly perturb the position of the hub F251, which could propagate these perturbations into the Sfβgly active site through short connection pathways along the protein network.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f5a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valquiria P.

Replacement of residues A263 and A264, which side-chains project from the α-helix towards F251, decreased the rate of substrate hydrolysis. Mutation A263F was shown to weaken noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization within the Sfβgly active site. Mutations placed on the opposite side of the same α-helix did not show these effects. Consistently, replacement of V336, which side-chain protrudes from a β-strand face towards F251, inactivated Sfβgly. Next to V336, mutation S337F also caused a decrease in noncovalent interactions involved in transition state stabilization. Therefore, we suggest that mutations A263F, A264F, V336F and S337F may directly perturb the position of the hub F251, which could propagate these perturbations into the Sfβgly active site through short connection pathways along the protein network.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006150</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006150</originId><recrawled>1527626526848</recrawled><author><name>Rui Ma</name></author><updated>1527627600000</updated><crawled>1527617284143</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HugZ5m7-OgU/article</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006150</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>c3e2c303</fingerprint><published>1527627600000</published><title>Structural organization and energy storage in crosslinked actin assemblies</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>2</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Ma, Julien Berro&lt;/p&gt;
During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385da6:c2c34441</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Ma, Julien Berro&lt;/p&gt;

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers.

Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit. This retrospective observational study enrolled female patients who were admitted for gynecological or general surgery. The patients received general anesthesia and were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The PI, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after administration of intravenous morphine. Changes in these parameters before and after analgesics were administered and the difference of these parameters between age and BMI subgroups were compared. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and %ΔPI and %ΔVAS were also evaluated. The percentage change in ΔPI (P9-T0/T0) of the patients at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit relative to baseline PI measurements was calculated. Eighty patients were enrolled, and there were 123 instances during which analgesia was required. Heart rate, PI, and VAS score were significantly different before and after analgesics were administered (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The difference of parameters between age and BMI subgroups were not significant. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and the percentage change in ΔPI and ΔVAS showed weak correlations in age, BMI subgroups, and all measurements. The baseline PI and the PI when arriving at and when being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The mean percentage change in Δ PI at the time of discharge from the PACU was 66.2%, and the 99% confidence interval was 12.2%~120.3%. The perfusion index was increased, and the VAS score was decreased significantly after analgesics were administered, but the correlation was weak in each subgroup. The VAS score is a subjective and psychometric parameter. The PI increased when partial pain relief was achieved after morphine was administered but did not reflect pain intensity or changes in the VAS score regardless of age or BMI. A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c7:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chun-Lin Chu, Yi-You Huang, Ying-Hou Chen, Ling-Ping Lai, Huei-Ming Yeh&lt;/p&gt;
Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit.

We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD).

Background &lt;p&gt;Transgender persons are highly victimized, marginalized, disproportionately experience incarceration, and have alarmingly increased rates of HIV infection compared to cis-gender persons. Few studies have examined the HIV care continuum outcomes among transgender women (TW), particularly TW who are involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding of HIV care continuum outcomes and risk behaviors among HIV-infected TW who are involved with the CJ system, we analyzed data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse-supported Seek, Test, Treat, Retain (STTR) Data Harmonization Initiative. Baseline data were pooled and analyzed from three U.S. STTR studies to examine HIV risk and care continuum indicators among CJ-involved HIV-infected TW compared to cisgender men (CM), matched on age (within 5 years) and study at a ratio of 1:5.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight TW and 440 CM were included in the study. Among matched participants, TW were more likely to report crack and cocaine use compared to CM (40%,16% respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001); both TW and CM reported high rates of condomless sex (58%, 64%, respectively); TW were more likely than CM to have more than one sexual partner (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and have engaged in exchange sex (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3, 6.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between TW and CM in the percentage currently taking ART (52%, 49%, respectively), the mean percent adherence to ART (77% for both groups), and the proportion who achieved viral suppression (61%, 58%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;HIV-infected CJ-involved TW and CM had similar use of ART and viral suppression but TW were more likely than matched CM to engage in exchange sex, have multiple sexual partners, and use crack/cocaine. TW and CM had similarly high rates of condomless sex and use of other drugs. TW require tailored risk reduction interventions, however both CJ-involved TW and CM require focused attention to reduce HIV risk and improve HIV continuum of care outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094064:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Curt G.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bce:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cristina Tintori, Giulia Iovenitti, Elisa Rita Ceresola, Roberto Ferrarese, Claudio Zamperini, Annalaura Brai, Giulio Poli, Elena Dreassi, Valeria Cagno, David Lembo, Filippo Canducci, Maurizio Botta&lt;/p&gt;

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The study provided a highly sensitive method for accurate analysis of trace vitamins from natural products.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f49:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Baolei Fan, Jinmao You, Yourui Suo, Chunqi Qian&lt;/p&gt;

To ease the development and analysis of logical models, a series of software tools have been proposed, often with specific assets. However, combining these tools typically implies a series of cumbersome software installation and model conversion steps. In this respect, the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook provides a joint distribution of several logical modelling software tools, along with an interactive web Python interface easing the chaining of complementary analyses. In this protocol, we demonstrate the assets of this approach through the analysis of a computational model of biological network. Our computational workflow combines (1) the importation of a GINsim model and its display, (2) its format conversion using the Java library BioLQM, (3) the formal prediction of mutations using the OCaml software Pint, (4) the model checking using the C++ software NuSMV, (5) quantitative stochastic simulations using the C++ software MaBoSS, and (6) the visualisation of results using the Python library matplotlib. We rely on the CoLoMoTo Interactive Notebook to provide a thoroughly documented and executable notebook of our computational analysis. Starting with a recent Boolean model of the signalling network controlling tumour cell invasion and migration, our model analysis culminates with the prediction of sets of mutations presumably involved in a metastatic phenotype. Beyond the specific application considered here, the resulting Jupyter notebook constitutes a tutorial for the use and combination of several logical modelling tools, which can be easily adapted to analyse other models. Furthermore, the notebook web interface and the companion Docker distribution of logical modelling tools greatly facilitate the production of accessible and reproducible model analysis workflows.</description><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1634c0e8123:16e584b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Boolean and multi-valued logical formalisms are increasingly used to model complex cellular networks.

The development of new dosimeters with good dosimetric properties is important for quality control in radiation applications. A new practical electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimeter based on carbonated hydroxyapatite that simulated the composition and structure of tooth enamel was specially synthesized. The synthesized material was investigated by transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy to confirm to the main composition of carbonated hydroxyapatite with CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; successfully doped into the crystal lattice through optimizing the synthesis process of C/P molar ratio, pH value dynamical adjustment, annealing temperature and time. The dosimetric properties were systematically investigated by ESR spectroscopy. The results indicated that the radiation induced signal had a good dose response within a relatively wide dose range. The dose response was linear in the dose range of 0–400 Gy with a correlation coefficient of 0.9999 and had dose accumulative effect in the experimental dose range of 0–100 Gy. In a wider dose range up to 30 kGy, the dose response also presented linear feature in double-logarithmic coordinate system with a correlation coefficient of 0.9970. The dose detection limit was about 0.34Gy with a given probability of 95% confidence level depending upon a rigid calculation algorithm. The signal was extremely stable in the observation time of 360 days with a variation coefficient of 3.8%. The radiation sensitivity of the material showed no remarkable variation against photon energy from 662 KeV to 1.25 MeV and dose rate from 0.86 Gy/min to 12.17 Gy/min. The material showed more sensitive in lower photon energy range below 662 keV, which hint additional calibration may need when using in special photon energy condition. The preliminary results suggested that this newly developed dosimeter was potential to become a practical dosimeter that would expand the application fields of ESR dosimetry.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c17:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ye Liu, Lei Ma, Junwang Guo, Guofu Dong, Jianbo Cong, Yunlong Ji, Jing Ning, Guoshan Yang, Ke Wu&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0e8:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406d:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ian R.

We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7</originId><author><name>James D.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/340505v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/340505v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Tolhuis, B.</name></author><crawled>1528298533959</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/340505v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>f4ed561a</fingerprint><published>1528268400000</published><title>Validation of an ultra-fast CNV calling tool for Next Generation Sequencing data using MLPA-verified copy number alterations [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/06/340505</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>DNA Copy Number Variations (CNVs) are an important source for genetic diversity and pathogenic variants.

Non-contact heart rate (HR) measurement from facial videos has attracted high interests due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. However, accurate and robust HR estimation under various realistic scenarios remain a very challenging problem. In this paper, we develop a novel system which can achieve a robust and accurate HR estimation under those challenging scenarios. First, to minimize tracking-artifacts arising from large head motions and facial expressions, we propose a joint face detection and alignment method which can produce alignment-friendly facial bounding boxes with reliable initial facial shapes, facilitating accurate and robust face alignment even in the presence of large pose variations and expressions. Second, different from most existing methods [1–5] which derive pulse signals from predetermined grid cells (i.e. local patches), our patches are varying-sized triangles generated adaptively to exclude negative effects from non-rigid facial motions. Third, we propose an adaptive patch selection method to choose patches which contain skin regions and are more likely to contain useful information, followed by an independent component analysis, for an accurate HR estimate. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our own dataset demonstrated that, comparing with the state-of-the-art methods [1–3], our method reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by a large margin, ranging from 12% to 63%, and can provide a robust and accurate estimation under various challenging scenarios.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7e:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhiwei Wang, Xin Yang, Kwang-Ting Cheng&lt;/p&gt;

Measuring red blood cell (RBC) deformability has become important for clinical disease diagnostics. Various methods for measuring RBC deformability have been developed; however, they require costly and large instruments, long measuring time, and skilled personnel. In this study, we present a three-dimensional-printed mini-disk (3D-PMD) for measuring RBC deformability to overcome the previous limitations. For a miniaturized and low-cost setup, the 3D-PMD was fabricated by a 3D printing technique, which had not yet been used for fabricating a lab-on-a-compact disk (LOCD). Using a 3D printing technique, a multi-layered fluidic channel on the mini CD could be fabricated easily. During rotation by a spinning motor, the difference of the length of compressed RBCs in the fluidic channel was measured and analysed as compressibility indices (CIs) of normal and glutaraldehyde-treated hardened RBCs. The rotation speed and time were decided as 3000 rpm and 30 min, respectively, at which the difference of CI values between normal and hardened RBCs was largest (CI&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;-CI&lt;sub&gt;hardened&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.195).</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405d:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hyunjung Lim, Seung Min Back, Jeonghun Nam, Hyuk Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The rotation speed and time were decided as 3000 rpm and 30 min, respectively, at which the difference of CI values between normal and hardened RBCs was largest (CI&lt;sub&gt;normal&lt;/sub&gt;-CI&lt;sub&gt;hardened&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.195).</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</originId><author><name>Jukka M.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c57:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jukka M.

The biological impetus for gene dosage and allele specificity of mammalian imprinted genes is not fully understood. To address this, we generated and analyzed four sets of mice from a single breeding scheme with varying allelic expression and gene dosage of the &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; domain. The mutants with abrogation of the two paternally expressed genes, &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt;, showed a significant decrease in growth rates for both males and females, while the mutants with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an increased growth rate of female mice only. The mutant cohort with biallelic expression of &lt;i&gt;Peg3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Usp29&lt;/i&gt; tended to have greater numbers of pups compared to the other genotypes. The mutants with switched active alleles displayed overall similar phenotypes to the wild type, but did show some differences in gene expression, suggesting potential non-redundant roles contributed by the maternal and paternal alleles. Overall, this study demonstrates a novel &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to investigate the allele and dosage specificity of mammalian imprinted domains.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42269:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Corey L.

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;triticina&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers &lt;i&gt;usw215&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usw218&lt;/i&gt; were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while &lt;i&gt;usw260&lt;/i&gt; was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0eb:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dhouha Kthiri, Alexander Loladze, P.

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood. Finally, we found ANKK1 expression in regenerative fibers of muscles from dystrophic patients. Future studies in ANKK1 biology and the pathological response of muscles will reveal whether this protein is a novel muscle disease biomarker.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219e:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Estrella Rubio-Solsona, Salvador Martí, Juan J.

FTIR and NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical structures of the obtained nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated very good dispersions of all carbon nanofillers in both polymer matrices. DSC results revealed that the addition of nano-sized fillers eliminated cold crystallization of materials containing 40% hard segments in polymer matrix. We found that the high aspect ratio, 1D nano-filler (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) strongly nucleated crystallization of materials containing 60% of hard segments.

FTIR and NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical structures of the obtained nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated very good dispersions of all carbon nanofillers in both polymer matrices. DSC results revealed that the addition of nano-sized fillers eliminated cold crystallization of materials containing 40% hard segments in polymer matrix. We found that the high aspect ratio, 1D nano-filler (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) strongly nucleated crystallization of materials containing 60% of hard segments. This nanofiller also yielded the greatest improvement in the Young’s modulus as assessed by tensile tests, both at 24 ºC and 37 ºC.

Safe and efficacious orally-delivered mucosal vaccine platforms are desperately needed to combat the plethora of mucosally transmitted pathogens. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. have emerged as attractive candidates to meet this need and are known to activate the host innate immune response in a species- and strain-specific manner. For selected bacterial isolates and mutants, we investigated the role of key innate immune pathways required for induction of innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Co-culture of murine macrophages with &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;gasseri&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCK1785), &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; (strain NCFM), or NCFM-derived mutants—NCK2025 and NCK2031—elicited an M2b-like phenotype associated with TH2 skewing and immune regulatory function. For NCFM, this M2b phenotype was dependent on expression of lipoteichoic acid and S layer proteins. Through the use of macrophage genetic knockouts, we identified Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) receptor, and the inflammasome-associated caspase-1 as contributors to macrophage activation, with NOD2 cooperating with caspase-1 to induce inflammasome derived interleukin (IL)-1β in a pyroptosis-independent fashion. Finally, utilizing an NCFM-based mucosal vaccine platform with surface expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag or membrane proximal external region (MPER), we demonstrated that NOD2 signaling is required for antigen-specific mucosal and systemic humoral responses. We show that lactobacilli differentially utilize innate immune pathways and highlight NOD2 as a key mediator of macrophage function and antigen-specific humoral responses to a &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/i&gt; mucosal vaccine platform.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42261:5785ab88</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara A.

Recent experiments showed that engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; colonies grow and self-organize into periodic stripes with high and low cell densities in semi-solid agar. The stripes develop sequentially behind a radially propagating colony front, similar to the formation of many other periodic patterns in nature. These bacteria were created by genetically coupling the intracellular chemotaxis pathway of wild-type cells with a quorum sensing module through the protein CheZ. In this paper, we develop multiscale models to investigate how this intracellular pathway affects stripe formation. We first develop a detailed hybrid model that treats each cell as an individual particle and incorporates intracellular signaling via an internal ODE system. To overcome the computational cost of the hybrid model caused by the large number of cells involved, we next derive a mean-field PDE model from the hybrid model using asymptotic analysis. We show that this analysis is justified by the tight agreement between the PDE model and the hybrid model in 1D simulations. Numerical simulations of the PDE model in 2D with radial symmetry agree with experimental data semi-quantitatively. Finally, we use the PDE model to make a number of testable predictions on how the stripe patterns depend on cell-level parameters, including cell speed, cell doubling time and the turnover rate of intracellular CheZ.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7yiJrNeGjk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163cbf78bf1:de5cd4:c2c34441</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoru Xue, Chuan Xue, Min Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Extensively used in macroevolution for analysing diversification, and in epidemiology for estimating viral dynamics, the birth-death process (BDP) is an important null model for inferring the parameters of reconstructed phylogenies. In this paper we show how optimal, point process (Snyder) filtering techniques can be used for parametric inference on BDPs. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Snyder filter (SF) to estimate birth and death rate parameters, given a reconstructed phylogeny. Our estimation procedure makes use of the equivalent Markov birth process description for a reconstructed birth-death phylogeny (Nee et al, 1994). We first analyse the popular constant rate BDP and show that our method gives results consistent with previous work. Among these results is an analytic solution to the special case of the Yule-Furry model. We also find an equivalence between the SF Poisson likelihood and two standard conditioned birth-death model likelihoods. We then generalise our estimation problem to BDPs with time varying rates and numerically solve the SF for two illustrative cases. Our results compare well with a recent Markov chain Monte Carlo method by Hohna et al (2016) and we numericaly show that both methods are solving the same likelihood functions. Lastly we apply the SF to a model selection problem on empirical data. We use the Australian Agamid dataset and predict the same relative model fit as that of the original maximum likelihood technique developed and used by Rabosky (2006) for this dataset. While several capable parametric and non-parametric birth-death estimators already exist, ours is the first to take the Nee et al approach, and directly computes the posterior distribution of the parameters. The SF makes no approximations, beyond those required for parameter space discretisation and numerical integration, and is mean square error optimal. It is deterministic, easily implementable and flexible. We think SFs present a promising alternative parametric BDP inference engine.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1633758f97c:24cf94e:5785ab88</id><unread>False</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The discrete space, continuous time birth-death model is a key process for describing phylogenies in the absence of coalescent approximations.

Glucose and palmitate synergistically stimulate insulin secretion, but chronically elevated they induce apoptotic β-cell death. The glucotoxic effect has been attributed, at least partly, to the upregulation of the oxidative stress marker thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Palmitate downregulates TXNIP expression, the functional significance of which is still under debate. This study examines the mechanism and consequence of palmitate-mediated TXNIP regulation in insulin secreting cells. Palmitate (600 μM) reduced TXNIP mRNA levels in isolated human and mouse islets independently of FFAR1/GPR40. Similar effects of palmitate were observed in INS-1E cells and mimicked by other long chain fatty acids. The lowering of TXNIP mRNA was significant already 1 h after addition of palmitate, persisted for 24 h and was directly translated to changes in TXNIP protein. The pharmacological inhibition of palmitate-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK1/2, JNK and PKCα/β by BML-275, PD98059, SP600125 and Gö6976, respectively, did not abolish palmitate-mediated TXNIP downregulation. The effect of palmitate was superimposed by a time-dependent (8 h and 24 h) decline of TXNIP mRNA and protein. This decline correlated with accumulation of secreted insulin into the medium. Accordingly, exogenously added insulin reduced TXNIP mRNA and protein levels, an effect counteracted by the insulin/IGF-1 receptor antagonist linsitinib. The inhibition of PI3K and Akt/PKB increased TXNIP mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) inhibitor MS-275 completely abrogated the time-dependent, insulin-mediated reduction of TXNIP, leaving the effect of palmitate unaltered. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion and chronic accentuation of cell death by palmitate occurred independently of TXNIP regulation. On the contrary, palmitate antagonized glucose-augmented ROS production. In conclusion, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is efficiently antagonized by two independent mechanisms, namely via an autocrine activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptors involving HDAC and by palmitate attenuating oxidative stress of β-cells.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c19:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Madhura Panse, Oliver Kluth, Estela Lorza-Gil, Gabriele Kaiser, Eckhard Mühlbauer, Annette Schürmann, Hans-Ulrich Häring, Susanne Ullrich, Felicia Gerst&lt;/p&gt;

Fossil evidence indicates that modern assemblages of temperate nonmarine planktonic diatoms began near the middle/late Miocene boundary when the genus &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt;, an important constituent of lacustrine planktonic diatom assemblages during the early to middle Miocene, was replaced by genera of the family Stephanodiscaceae. This floral turnover has been confirmed in many regions of the world, except eastern Asia where taxonomic data about early and middle Miocene planktonic diatom assemblages have until recently been scarce. Our analysis of Lower and Middle Miocene lacustrine diatomaceous rocks in Japan confirms that species of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; were important constituents of lake phytoplankton there as well. The appearance of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; species near the beginning of the Miocene may have resulted from the introduction of euryhaline species into lacustrine environments during a highstand of sea level at that time. Similarly, it is possible that species of Stephanodiscaceae evolved from marine thalassiosiroid ancestors that invaded high latitude lacustrine environments during multiple Paleogene highstands, resulting in a polyphyletic origin of the family. The turnover from nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; to Stephanodiscaceae genera near the middle/late Miocene boundary may be linked to a contemporaneous increase in silica concentrations in lakes caused by active volcanism, increased weathering of silicate rocks due to orogeny, and the expansion of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; grasslands. This turnover may also have been influenced by enhanced seasonal environmental changes in the euphotic zone caused by the initiation of monsoon conditions and a worldwide increase in meridional temperature gradients during the late Miocene. Morphological characteristics of Stephanodiscaceae genera, such as strutted processes and small size, suggest their species were better adapted to seasonal environmental changes than nonmarine species of &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; because of their superiority in floating and drifting capabilities and possibly metabolism, intrinsic growth rate, and reproductivity. As climates deteriorated during the late Miocene, Stephanodiscaceae species may have spread from high latitudes to temperate lakes where they diversified, ultimately displacing &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt;.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc0:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Hayashi, William N.

Fossil evidence indicates that modern assemblages of temperate nonmarine planktonic diatoms began near the middle/late Miocene boundary when the genus &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt;, an important constituent of lacustrine planktonic diatom assemblages during the early to middle Miocene, was replaced by genera of the family Stephanodiscaceae. This floral turnover has been confirmed in many regions of the world, except eastern Asia where taxonomic data about early and middle Miocene planktonic diatom assemblages have until recently been scarce. Our analysis of Lower and Middle Miocene lacustrine diatomaceous rocks in Japan confirms that species of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; were important constituents of lake phytoplankton there as well. The appearance of nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; species near the beginning of the Miocene may have resulted from the introduction of euryhaline species into lacustrine environments during a highstand of sea level at that time. Similarly, it is possible that species of Stephanodiscaceae evolved from marine thalassiosiroid ancestors that invaded high latitude lacustrine environments during multiple Paleogene highstands, resulting in a polyphyletic origin of the family. The turnover from nonmarine &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; to Stephanodiscaceae genera near the middle/late Miocene boundary may be linked to a contemporaneous increase in silica concentrations in lakes caused by active volcanism, increased weathering of silicate rocks due to orogeny, and the expansion of C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; grasslands. This turnover may also have been influenced by enhanced seasonal environmental changes in the euphotic zone caused by the initiation of monsoon conditions and a worldwide increase in meridional temperature gradients during the late Miocene. Morphological characteristics of Stephanodiscaceae genera, such as strutted processes and small size, suggest their species were better adapted to seasonal environmental changes than nonmarine species of &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt; because of their superiority in floating and drifting capabilities and possibly metabolism, intrinsic growth rate, and reproductivity. As climates deteriorated during the late Miocene, Stephanodiscaceae species may have spread from high latitudes to temperate lakes where they diversified, ultimately displacing &lt;i&gt;Actinocyclus&lt;/i&gt;.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6</originId><author><name>Guo-Jie Wu</name></author><crawled>1527845332130</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/Nh8XOC-_UnI/s41467-018-04480-6</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>62863958</fingerprint><published>1527836400000</published><title>Total synthesis of cyrneines A–B and glaucopine C</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total synthesis of cyrneines A–B and glaucopine C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total synthesis of cyrneines A–B and glaucopine C, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04480-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cyrneine diterpenoids represent a biologically important subfamily of cyathane-type diterpenoids.

For nearly a century, conventional microbiological methods have been standard practice for detecting and identifying pathogens in food. Nevertheless, the microbiological safety of food has improved and various rapid methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Alternative methods are expected to detect low cell numbers, since the presence in food of even a single cell of a pathogenic organism may be infectious. With respect to low population levels, the performance of a detection method is assessed by producing serial dilutions of a pure bacterial suspension to inoculate representative food matrices with highly diluted bacterial cells (fewer than 10 CFU/ml). The accuracy of data obtained by multiple dilution techniques is not certain and does not exclude some colonies arising from clumps of cells. Micromanipulation techniques to capture and isolate single cells from environmental samples were introduced more than 40 years ago. The main limitation of the current micromanipulation technique is still the low recovery rate for the growth of a single cell in culture medium. In this study, we describe a new single cell isolation method and demonstrate that it can be used successfully to grow various types of microorganism from picked individual cells. Tests with Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including cocci, rods, aerobes, anaerobes, yeasts and molds showed growth recovery rates from 60% to 100% after micromanipulation. We also highlight the use of our method to evaluate and challenge the detection limits of standard detection methods in food samples contaminated by a single cell of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b948:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marisa Hohnadel, Myriam Maumy, Renaud Chollet&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is minimal invasive techniques to reconstruct the vertebral height and prevent further collapse of the fractured vertebrae by injecting polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral body. However, recompression of polymethylmethacrylate augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggressive local kyphotic was observed frequently after VP or KP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential risk factors associated with polymethylmethacrylate distribution for recompression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and six (37.7%) patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period. The polymethylmethacrylate distributed in the middle of vertebral body showed significant differences between two groups. In non-recompression group, the polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body were closer to endplates than that in the recompression group (upper: t = 31.41, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001; lower: t = 12.19, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The higher percentage of the height of polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body indicates the lower risk of recompression (odds ratio [OR]&amp;lt;0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The recompression group and non-recompression group showed significant difference in “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern (polymethylmethacrylate contacted to the both upper/lower endplates) (&lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 66.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The vertebra with a “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern has lower risk of recompression (OR = 0.09, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Either more polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body or “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern had a significantly less incidence of recompression. The findings indicated that the control of polymethylmethacrylate distribution during surgery may reduce the risks of recompression after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84550:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Hou, Qi Yao, Genai Zhang, Lixiang Ding, Hui Huang&lt;/p&gt;

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential risk factors associated with polymethylmethacrylate distribution for recompression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and six (37.7%) patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period. The polymethylmethacrylate distributed in the middle of vertebral body showed significant differences between two groups. In non-recompression group, the polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body were closer to endplates than that in the recompression group (upper: t = 31.41, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001; lower: t = 12.19, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The higher percentage of the height of polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body indicates the lower risk of recompression (odds ratio [OR]&amp;lt;0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The recompression group and non-recompression group showed significant difference in “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern (polymethylmethacrylate contacted to the both upper/lower endplates) (&lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 66.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The vertebra with a “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern has lower risk of recompression (OR = 0.09, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Either more polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body or “contacted” polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern had a significantly less incidence of recompression. The findings indicated that the control of polymethylmethacrylate distribution during surgery may reduce the risks of recompression after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25222?af=R</link><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25222?af=R</originId><author><name>CarloGatti

The SF is used to locate the important regions that control the hydrogen bonds in both Watson–Crick (WC) DNA dimers (adenine:thymine (AT) and guanine:cytosine (GC)) which are studied in their neutral and their singly ionized (radical cationic and anionic) ground states.

Optimization of DNA vaccine delivery improves the potency of the immune response and is crucial to clinical success. Here, we inquired how such optimization impacts the magnitude of the response, its specificity and type. BALB/c mice were DNA-immunized with two model immunogens, HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase by intramuscular or intradermal injections with electroporation. DNA immunogens were co-delivered with DNA encoding luciferase. Delivery and expression were monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). The endpoint immune responses were assessed by IFN-γ/IL-2 FluoroSpot, multiparametric flow cytometry and antibody ELISA. Expression and immunogenicity were compared in relation to the delivery route. Regardless of the route, protease generated mainly IFN-γ, and reverse transcriptase, IL-2 and antibody response. BLI of mice immunized with protease- or reverse transcriptase/reporter plasmid mixtures, demonstrated significant loss of luminescence over time. The rate of decline of luminescence strongly correlated with the magnitude of immunogen-specific response, and depended on the immunogenicity profile and the immunization route. In vitro and in vivo BLI-based assays demonstrated that intradermal delivery strongly improved the immunogenicity of protease, and to a lesser extent, of reverse transcriptase. Immune response polarization and epitope hierarchy were not affected. Thus, by changing delivery/immunogen expression sites, it is possible to modulate the magnitude, but not the type or fine specificity of the induced immune response.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b779:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Petkov, Elizaveta Starodubova, Anastasia Latanova, Athina Kilpeläinen, Oleg Latyshev, Simons Svirskis, Britta Wahren, Francesca Chiodi, Ilya Gordeychuk, Maria Isaguliants&lt;/p&gt;

Our computational framework enables us to share information across tumors to learn patient-specific inferred TF activities, revealing regulatory differences between and within tumor types. Many of the identified TF regulators were significantly associated with survival outcome in basal breast, uterine serous and endometrioid carcinomas.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model. We introduce a simple approach suitable for combined ablation and TACE of HCC in a single treatment session.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2340:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pascale Tinguely, Marius Schwalbe, Torsten Fuss, Dominik P.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475056:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. The methodological approach and analyses used in this study can also be applied to other public health programs to evaluate the coverage and breadth of public health services.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b785:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Priti Pednekar, Andrew Peterson&lt;/p&gt;

of airborne chemicals via chemosensory receptors that have evolved independently multiple times throughout the tree of life. In insects, the odorant receptor (OR) gene family is the major chemosensory gene family involved in olfaction and its origin has been hypothesized to coincide with the evolution of a terrestrial lifestyle in hexapods. Missbach et al. (2014) challenged this view and suggested that ORs evolved with an ancestral OR co-receptor (Orco) after the origin of terrestriality, hypothesizing that the OR/Orco system is an adaptation to winged flight in insects instead. Building upon this work, we investigated the genomes of basal hexapod and insect lineages including Collembola, Diplura, Archaeognatha, Zygentoma, Odonata, and Ephemeroptera in an effort to identify the origin of the insect OR gene family. While absent from all non-insect hexapod lineages analyzed, ORs are present in all insect genomes. Orco is absent only in the most ancient insect lineage Archaeognatha. A fully functional OR/Orco system was present in our newly generated genome data of the Zygentoma Thermobia domestica. We suggest that ORs did evolve as adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle outside high-humidity habitats, and not winged flight, representing a key evolutionary novelty in the ancestor of all insects. The OR family is therefore the first known molecular synapomorphy for the Class Insecta.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1635e996724:2eeba1e:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The sense of smell enables the detection and discrimination of airborne chemicals via chemosensory receptors that have evolved independently multiple times throughout the tree of life.

However, morphology quantification has been rarely carried out via image analysis. In this work, we designed a MATLAB program to evaluate two key parameters describing morphology of small molecule semiconductor thin films: fractal dimension and film coverage. We then employ this program in a case study of meniscus-guided coating of 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) under various conditions to analyze a diverse and complex morphology set.

However, morphology quantification has been rarely carried out via image analysis. In this work, we designed a MATLAB program to evaluate two key parameters describing morphology of small molecule semiconductor thin films: fractal dimension and film coverage. We then employ this program in a case study of meniscus-guided coating of 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) under various conditions to analyze a diverse and complex morphology set. The evolution of morphology in terms of fractal dimension and film coverage was studied as a function of coating speed. We discovered that combined fractal dimension and film coverage can quantitatively capture the key characteristics of C8-BTBT thin film morphology; change of these two parameters further inform morphology transition. Furthermore, fractal dimension could potentially shed light on thin film growth mechanisms.</content></summary><unread>True</unread><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1633ae7ab12:29c3e00:5785ab88</id></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318881v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318881v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Sidhom, J.-W.</name></author><crawled>1527264564256</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318881v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>b8339972</fingerprint><published>1527231600000</published><title>AI-MHC: an allele-integrated deep learning framework for improving Class I &amp; Class II HLA-binding predictions [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/318881</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Motivation: The immune system has potential to present a wide variety of peptides to itself as a means of surveillance for pathogenic invaders. This means of surveillances allows the immune system to detect peptides derives from bacterial, viral, and even oncologic sources.

Results: We present Allele-Integrated MHC (AI-MHC), a deep learning architecture with improved performance over the current state-of-the-art algorithms in human Class I and Class II MHC binding prediction. Our architecture utilizes a convolutional neural network that improves prediction accuracy by 1) allowing one neural network to be trained on all peptides for all alleles of a given class of MHC molecules by making the allele an input to the net and 2) introducing a global max pooling operation with an optimized kernel size that allows the architecture to achieve translational invariance in MHC-peptide binding analysis, making it suitable for sequence analytics where a frame of interest needs to be learned in a longer, variable length sequence. We assess AI-MHC against internal independent test sets and compare against all algorithms in the IEDB automated server benchmarks, demonstrating our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art for both Class I and Class II prediction.

Most children and adolescents with chronic health conditions have impaired health-related quality of life and are at high risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8–18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/ physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was a health-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b953:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Silva, Monika Bullinger, Helena Moreira, Maria Cristina Canavarro, Carlos Carona&lt;/p&gt;

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b82:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

Annatto (&lt;i&gt;Bixa orellana&lt;/i&gt; L.) is a tropical American crop, commercially valuable due to its application in the food and cosmetics industries as a natural dye. The wild ancestor of cultivated annatto is &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt;. Although never cultivated, this variety occurs in open forests and anthropogenic landscapes, and is always associated with riparian environments. In this study, we evaluated the genetic diversity and structure of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;orellana&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;urucurana&lt;/i&gt; populations in Brazilian Amazonia using 16 microsatellite loci. We used Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) to characterize the potential geographical range of this variety in northern South America. We analyzed 170 samples from 10 municipalities in the states of Rondônia, Pará and Roraima. A total of 194 alleles was observed, with an average of 12.1 alleles per locus. Higher levels of expected (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) than observed (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;) heterozygosities were found for all populations. Bayesian analysis, Neighbor-Joining dendrograms and PCAs suggest the existence of three strongly structured groups of populations. A strong and positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found, suggesting that genetic differentiation might be caused by geographic isolation. From species distribution modelling, we detected that South Rondônia, Madre di Dios River basin, Llanos de Mojos, Llanos de Orinoco and eastern Ecuador are highly suitable areas for wild annatto to occur, providing additional targets for future exploration and conservation.

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676123d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

High-resolution (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) enables researchers to study how anatomical and functional properties change within the cortical ribbon, along surfaces and across cortical depths. These studies require an accurate delineation of the gray matter ribbon, which often suffers from inclusion of blood vessels, dura mater and other non-brain tissue. Residual segmentation errors are commonly corrected by browsing the data slice-by-slice and manually changing labels. This task becomes increasingly laborious and prone to error at higher resolutions since both work and error scale with the number of voxels. Here we show that many mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations as an additional post-processing step aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations openly available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4f:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Omer Faruk Gulban, Marian Schneider, Ingo Marquardt, Roy A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Quick background for those not in the field: a great many three-dimensional molecules can exist in right-handed and left-handed mirror-image forms (enantiomers), exactly like pairs of shoes. They have the property of “chirality”. When this happens with drug compounds, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/28/right-hand-left-hand-either-hand&quot;&gt;generally the case&lt;/a&gt; that the two have different activities, because proteins in the body are chiral, too. Where that handedness comes from is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/12/15/chirality-from-chemical-supply-houses-to-life-as-we-know-it&quot;&gt;rather deep question&lt;/a&gt;. Separating enantiomers is generally done by using another chiral substance (making derivatives or salts of the parent compound or passing across a purification column loaded with some chiral solid phase].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of proposals in this vein, although it’s a minefield of subtlety (and of irreproducible experiments). But there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/24/a_new_way_to_determine_chirality&quot;&gt;electromagnetic effects&lt;/a&gt; that are both theoretically feasible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/05/enantioselectivity-with-microwaves&quot;&gt;experimentally real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/09/science.aar4265.full&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be another one. The paper starts off, I should note, with a brief history on the intersection of chirality and magnetism, a topic that involved heavy hitters like Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Pierre Curie in its early days. During my own career, I well recall reports of chiral induction in magnetic fields that had to be retracted to much embarrassment, so it does take some bravery to venture into this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, a multicenter team from Israel, the US, Germany, and Poland, are taking advantage of a phenomenon called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Simply put – and I’m not going to be able to put it at a much higher level – electron movement through molecules is affected by their chirality. And that means that charge distribution in two enantiomers has different spin polarization in each one. That led the group to wonder about the interaction of chiral molecules with perpendicularly-magnetized surfaces, which have been the subject of much research in thin-film “spintronic” applications. In theory, one enantiomer could be attracted to such a surface much more than the other, depending on the direction of the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what happens. They picked a test helical polyalanine peptide and a gold-layered ferromagnet film (the gold is to protect it from oxidation, and the behavior of the exact peptide on gold layers had already been studied in other contexts). Attaching nanoparticles to the peptide (for visualization) and exposing these to the surface showed (by electron microscopy) a dramatic difference based on the direction of the perpendicular magnetic field. In one direction, the particles stick, and in the other they don’t. If the magnetization is in-plane (instead of perpendicular), there’s no difference, and there’s no difference if you’re applying an external magnetic field instead. It has to be a field associated with the thin layer, and it has to be in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also prepared a 50/50 mix of D- and L-peptides, and this (as it should) shows no circular dichroism. But after multiple exposures to fresh magnetic surfaces, the solution was clearly enriched in one enantiomer, and began to show circular dichroism as expected, increasing with the number of exposures. They then set this up as a flow experiment, and the results were unmistakeable: flowing an an enantiomeric mixture of two peptides down an unmagnetized column gave the same racemic mixture out the other end. But when the surface was magnetized “perpendicular down”, they got a strong CD spectrum from the eluent, and when it was magnetized “perpendicular up”, they got the mirror-image CD spectrum: the other enantiomer. The D enantiomers interact with the down-magnetized surfaces and the L enantiomers with the up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just peptides, either. A DNA oligomer was shown to bind to one magnetization and not the other, and the effect was reproduced with the single amino acid cysteine. In each case the kinetics are different for different sorts of molecules, different at various concentrations, and different between the enantiomers. The system thus has to be tuned for the best separation, but the effect is real across all of them. And that immediately suggests a whole new kind of chromatography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules with a magnetic substrate, presented in this article, provides a potentially generic chromatographic method for enantioseparation, which does not require a specific separating column. Because the observed effect depends on the electrical polarizability of the system (that is accompanied by spin polarization) and because this polarization depends on the global structure of the chiral molecule, the method described here may also allow the separation of chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral. In addition, this technique could potentially be applied for separating chiral molecules based on their secondary structure and/or for separating two secondary structures of the same chiral molecule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that a completely new analytical method has been invented, and I very much look forward to seeing what can be made out of it. We’re going to have to learn to think about chiral separations in a completely different way than we’re used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The evaluation of protected area networks on their capacity to preserve species distributions is a key topic in conservation biology. There are different types of protected areas, with National Parks those with highest level of protection. National Parks can be declared attending to many ecological features that include the presence of certain animal species. Here, we selected 37 vertebrate species that were highlighted as having relevant natural value for at least one of the 10 National Parks of mainland Spain. We modelled species distributions with the favourability function, and applied the Insecurity Index to detect the degree of protection of favourable areas for each species. Two metrics of Insecurity Index were defined for each species: the Insecurity Index in each of the cells, and the Overall Insecurity Index of a species. The former allows the identification of insecure areas for each species that can be used to establish spatial conservation priorities. The latter gives a value of Insecurity for each species, which we used to calculate the Representativeness of favourable areas for the species in the network. As expected, due to the limited extension of the National Park network, all species have high values of Insecurity; i.e., just a narrow proportion of their favourable areas are covered by a National Park. However, the majority of species favourable areas are well represented in the network, i.e., the percentage of favourable areas covered by the National Park network is higher than the percentage of mainland Spain covered by the network (result also supported by a randomization approach). Even if a reserve network only covers a low percentage of a country, the Overall Insecurity Index allows an objective assessment of its capacity to represent species. Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:676122b:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alba Estrada, Raimundo Real&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond the results presented here, the Insecurity Index has the potential to be extrapolated to other areas and to cover a wide range of species.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26964-7</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26964-7</originId><author><name>Toshitaka Wakayama</name></author><crawled>1528276870947</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/MmyNeN7QS5k/s41598-018-26964-7</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26964-7</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>3d5e85e</fingerprint><published>1528268400000</published><title>Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26964-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26964-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MmyNeN7QS5k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>529</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26964-7/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26964_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163d4666723:5af44e9:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26964-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26964-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Demonstration of a terahertz pure vector beam by tailoring geometric phase&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/MmyNeN7QS5k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326363v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326363v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Clarke, E.</name></author><crawled>1526681242553</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/326363v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>61b4eda5</fingerprint><published>1526626800000</published><title>Sunbeam: a pipeline for next-generation metagenomic sequencing experiments [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/326363</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>Background: Metagenomic sequencing experiments require a number of preprocessing and analytical steps to interpret the microbial and genetic composition of biological samples. Such steps include quality control, adapter trimming, host decontamination, metagenomic classification, read assembly, and alignment to reference genomes. Results: We present here an extensible and modular pipeline called Sunbeam that performs these steps in a consistent and reproducible way. It features a one-step installation and novel tools for eliminating artifactual sequences that may interfere with downstream analysis including Komplexity, a novel software tool to eliminate potentially problematic, low-complexity nucleotide sequences from metagenomic data. Another unique component of the Sunbeam pipeline is an easy-to-use extension framework that enables users to add custom processing or analysis steps directly to the Sunbeam workflow. Conclusions: Sunbeam provides a foundation to build more in-depth analyses and to enable comparisons between disparate sequencing experiments by standardizing routine pre-processing and analytical steps.

Using bulk RNA sequencing, splicing variation has been studied both across human tissues and in genetically diverse individuals. This has identified disease-relevant splicing events, as well as associations between splicing and genomic variations, including sequence composition and conservation. However, variability in splicing between single cells from the same tissue and its determinants remain poorly understood.

We also identified a moderate but significant contribution from DNA methylation to splicing variation across cells. By combining sequence information and DNA methylation, we derived an accurate model (AUC=0.85) for predicting different splicing modes of individual cassette exons.

Histocompatibility labs must convert molecular HLA typings to antigen equivalencies for entry into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) UNet system. While an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) policy document provides general guidelines for conversion, the process is complex because no antigen mapping table is available. We present a UNOS antigen equivalency table for all IMGT/HLA alleles at the A, B, C, DRB1, DRB3/4/5, DQA1, and DQB1 loci. Methods: An automated script was developed to generate a UNOS antigen equivalency table. Data sources used in the conversion algorithm included the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA) antigen table, the HLA Dictionary, and UNOS-provided tables. To validate antigen mappings, we converted National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) high resolution allele frequencies to antigen equivalents and compared with the UNOS Calculated Panel Reactive Antibodies (CPRA) reference panel. Results: Normalized frequency similarity scores between independent NMDP and UNOS panels for 4 US population categories (Caucasian, Hispanic, African American and Asian/Pacific Islander) ranged from 0.85 to 0.97, indicating correct antigen mapping. An open source web application (ALLele to ANtigen (ALLAN)) and web services were also developed to map unambiguous and ambiguous HLA typing data to UNOS antigen equivalents based on NMDP population-specific allele frequencies (http://www.transplanttoolbox.org). Conclusions: This tool sets a foundation for using molecular HLA typing to compute the virtual crossmatch and may aid in reducing typing discrepancies in UNet.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163933f978b:800becf:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Virtual crossmatch utilizes HLA typing and antibody screen assay data as a part of organ offers in deceased donor allocation systems.

Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an essential exonuclease in mammalian cells, and numerous in vivo and in vitro data evidenced its participation in immunity regulation and in genotoxicity remediation. In these very complicated cellular functions, the molecular mechanisms by which duplex DNA substrates are processed are mostly elusive because of the lack of structure information. Here, we report multiple crystal structures of TREX1 complexed with various substrates to provide the structure basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes. The substrates were designed to mimic the intermediate structural DNAs involved in various repair pathways. The results showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 served to cap the nonscissile 5′-end of the DNA for precise removal of the short 3′-overhang in L- and Y-structural DNA or to wedge into the double-stranded region for further digestion along the duplex. Biochemical assays were also conducted to demonstrate that TREX1 can indeed degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a full extent. Overall, this study provided unprecedented knowledge at the molecular level on the enzymatic substrate processing involved in prevention of immune activation and in responses to genotoxic stresses. For example, Arg128, whose mutation in TREX1 was linked to a disease state, were shown to exhibit consistent interaction patterns with the nonscissile strand in all of the structures we solved. Such structure basis is expected to play an indispensable role in elucidating the functional activities of TREX1 at the cellular level and in vivo.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nbs4P4qHduo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1633bba0164:e03f8b:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Wei Huang, Tung-Chang Liu, Ruei-Yue Liang, Lee-Ya Chu, Hiu-Lo Cheng, Jhih-Wei Chu, Yu-Yuan Hsiao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the considerable burden of helminth infections in developing countries and increasing international travel, little is known about the risks of infection for travelers.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We studied the attack and incidence rate of serology confirmed strongyloidiasis, filariasis, and toxocariasis among long-term travelers and associated factors. A second objective was to evaluate eosinophilia as a positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) for a recent helminth infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2011, clients of the Public Health Service travel clinic planning travel to (sub)tropical countries for 12–52 weeks were invited to participate in a prospective study. Participants kept a weekly diary, recording itinerary, symptoms, and physician visits during travel and completed a post-travel questionnaire. Pre- and post-travel blood samples were serologically tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; species, &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/i&gt;, filarial species, and &lt;i&gt;Toxacara&lt;/i&gt; species and were used for a blood cell count. Factors associated with recent infection were analyzed using Poisson regression. Differences among groups of travelers were studied using chi square tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For the 604 participants, median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23–29), 36% were male, median travel duration was 20 weeks (IQR: 15–25), and travel purpose was predominantly tourism (62%). Destinations were Asia (45%), Africa (18%), and the Americas (37%).Evidence of previous infection was found in 13/604 participants: antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 5 (0.8%), against &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;stercoralis&lt;/i&gt; in 3 (0.5%), against filarial species in 4 (0.7%), and against &lt;i&gt;Toxocara&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 1 (0.2%). Ten recent infections were found in 9 participants (3, 1, 6, 0 cases, in the above order), making the attack rates 0.61, 0.17, 1.1 and 0, and the incidence rates per 1000 person-months 1.5, 0.34, 2.6 and 0. The overall PPV and NPV of eosinophila for recent infection were 0 and 98%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The risk of the helminth infections under study in this cohort of long-term travelers was low. Routine screening for eosinophilia appeared not to be of diagnostic value.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb912:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Femke W.

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts.

Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636533aab5:3bac2ee:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25950-3</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25950-3</originId><author><name>Jiude Mao</name></author><crawled>1526462284539</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/m9a4ptYHXK0/s41598-018-25950-3</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25950-3</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>9147d8d5</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>In Utero and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Utero&lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;In Utero&amp;lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25950-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25950-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Utero&lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m9a4ptYHXK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>508</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25950-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25950_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163683e02fb:3f7c93d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Utero&lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;In Utero&amp;lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25950-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25950-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Utero&lt;/i&gt; and Postnatal Exposure to High Fat, High Sucrose Diet Suppressed Testis Apoptosis and Reduced Sperm Count&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/m9a4ptYHXK0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197134</originId><author><name>Signe M.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f78:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2338:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, Aimée Gayed, Bridget T.

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f80:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c3:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a2198:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219c:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cosmin Sebastian Voican, Amandine Lebrun, Sophie Maitre, Panagiotis Lainas, Karima Lamouri, Micheline Njike-Nakseu, Martin Gaillard, Hadrien Tranchart, Axel Balian, Ibrahim Dagher, Gabriel Perlemuter, Sylvie Naveau&lt;/p&gt;

A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323758v1?rss=1</link><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323758v1?rss=1</originId><author><name>Ikeno, H.</name></author><crawled>1526504274002</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323758v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><fingerprint>193cb08e</fingerprint><published>1526454000000</published><title>A segmentation scheme for complex neuronal arbors and application to vibration sensitive neurons in the honeybee brain [NEW RESULTS]</title><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/16/323758</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><description>The morphology of a neuron is strongly related to its physiological properties, and thus to information processing functions.

The mechanisms of these actions can only be fully understood in terms of native secondary and tertiary structures.

An &amp;quot;ambiguity index&amp;quot;, one for each pair of molecule and presumed secondary structure, measures the prevalence of false matches and hence the tendency to form metastable structures incompatible with native structures. The ambiguity index statistically separates an ensemble of RNA molecules that operate as single entities (Group I and II Introns) from an ensemble that operates as protein-RNA complexes (SRP and tmRNAs), and ensembles of secondary structures determined by comparative analysis from ones based on thermal equilibrium. We find lower average ambiguity in single-entity RNA&apos;s than protein-RNA complexes, and, among single-entity RNA&apos;s, lower ambiguity with comparative analyses than equilibrium analyses.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples). The Chilean &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. parsimony network displayed 1 main haplotype. Additional studies using isolates from many locations across Chile and different intermediate hosts will provide more data on the molecular structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. within this region. Likewise, investigations of the importance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; in human infection in Chile deserve future attention.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85437:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felipe Corrêa, Caroll Stoore, Pamina Horlacher, Mauricio Jiménez, Christian Hidalgo, Cristian A.

Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples). The Chilean &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. parsimony network displayed 1 main haplotype. Additional studies using isolates from many locations across Chile and different intermediate hosts will provide more data on the molecular structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. within this region. Likewise, investigations of the importance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; in human infection in Chile deserve future attention.</content></content></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026505?af=R</link><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5026505?af=R</originId><author><name>M.

Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636a1a35e2:4db35:d63e3ae2</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Damiano Pasetto, Flavio Finger, Anton Camacho, Francesco Grandesso, Sandra Cohuet, Joseph C.

Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ziyaad Valley-Omar, Preetha Iyengar, Claire von Mollendorf, Stefano Tempia, Alexandra Moerdyk, Orienka Hellferscee, Neil Martinson, Meredith McMorrow, Ebrahim Variava, Katlego Masonoke, Adam L.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) originating from eukaryotes or bacteria have been under intensive structural and biochemical investigation, whereas archaeal PTP proteins have not been investigated extensively; therefore, they are poorly understood. Here, we present the crystal structures of Tk-PTP derived from the hyperthermophilic archaeon &lt;i&gt;Thermococcus kodakaraensis&lt;/i&gt; KOD1, in both the active and inactive forms. Tk-PTP adopts a common dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) fold, but it undergoes an atypical temperature-dependent conformational change in its P-loop and α4−α5 loop regions, switching between the inactive and active forms. Through comprehensive analyses of Tk-PTP, including additional structural determination of the G95A mutant form, enzymatic activity assays, and structural comparison with the other archaeal PTP, it was revealed that the presence of the GG motif in the P-loop is necessary but not sufficient for the structural flexibility of Tk-PTP. It was also proven that Tk-PTP contains dual general acid/base residues unlike most of the other DUSP proteins, and that both the residues are critical in its phosphatase activity. This work provides the basis for expanding our understanding of the previously uncharacterized PTP proteins from archaea, the third domain of living organisms.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232a:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hye-Yeoung Yun, Jinhyuk Lee, Hyunmin Kim, Hyojung Ryu, Ho-Chul Shin, Byung-Ha Oh, Bonsu Ku, Seung Jun Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed1:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

The X-ray diffraction studies revealed the formation of structures where one, two, or three of the molecules involved in the retro-Claisen condensation reaction were linked to the lanthanoid centres.</content></summary><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163d6f0e536:5f76232:3dd877af</id><unread>True</unread></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006147</link><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006147</originId><recrawled>1527615723856</recrawled><author><name>Peter Helfer</name></author><updated>1527627600000</updated><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0_PVuKNJRBs/article</href></item></alternate><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006147</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>2c540046</fingerprint><published>1527627600000</published><title>Coupled feedback loops maintain synaptic long-term potentiation: A computational model of PKMzeta synthesis and AMPA receptor trafficking</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMζ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMζ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistability–stable equilibria both in the synapse’s potentiated and unpotentiated states–can arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df6:ed160cc3</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

To examine the 20-year trends in the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity among children aged 0–6 years between 1995 and 2015 in Harbin, China, we selected altogether 49,553 children aged 0–6 years old by using a multistage stratified cluster sampling methods in Harbin, one provincial capital city in northeast China in 1995, 2005 and 2015. Height and weight information of the children were collected. We used the child growth standards of World Health Organization to calculate the Z-scores for body mass index (BMI). Cut-offs recommended by World Health Organization and International Obesity Task Force were used to define overweight and obesity for each children. We found there is no difference between boys’ BMI and girls’ among newborns in each survey point (p&gt;0.05), but in older age groups, the BMI of boys was higher than that of girls (p&amp;lt;0.05). From 1995 to 2015, the average BMI was increasing continuously among boys older than 42 months and girls older than 48 months (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for linear trend across year) in Harbin. The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity increased from 2.6% in 1995 to 7.6% in 2015. For every 10-year the risk of combined overweight and obesity in children aged 0–6 years increased by 167% (95%CI: 146%, 188%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity in most age subgroups showed an increasing trend over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01 for trend test across survey year). The age when the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity dramatically increased was earlier in 2015 than that in 2005 and 1995. In conclusion, there was an increasing trend of the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity during the past 20 years in Harbin and the age when the prevalence dramatically increased became earlier.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Prescribing individualized moderate exercise intensity is a useful method to reach positive effects on health status in obese adults. This study aimed to establish a practical reference equation to estimate the heart rate (HR) at individual ventilatory threshold (IVT) (HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred sixty-one obese subjects were clinically evaluated and characterized by anthropometric and body composition. Participants performed the six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess IVT. Multiple regression analysis for HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;, including 6-MWT, anthropometric, and body composition parameters, as independent variables, was performed for both gender separately. A cross-validation study was also performed to determine the accuracy of the prediction equation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Whereas HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt; was not significantly different between males (121.5±18.3 bpm) and females (117.6±17.1 bpm), it differently correlated with physical and performance parameters. Therefore, two sex-specific equations were developed including 6-MWT&lt;sub&gt;HR&lt;/sub&gt; and HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.69 and 0.65 and root mean square errors of 8.8 and 10.1 bpm for females and males, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, in female and male obese adults, the 6-MWT might be used to predict HR at IVT. These outcomes are useful to prescribe optimal physical activity intensity when gold standard methods (e.g. gas exchange analysis) are unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7c:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gian Pietro Emerenziani, Dafne Ferrari, Maria Grazia Vaccaro, Maria Chiara Gallotta, Silvia Migliaccio, Andrea Lenzi, Carlo Baldari, Laura Guidetti&lt;/p&gt;

Participants performed the six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess IVT. Multiple regression analysis for HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;, including 6-MWT, anthropometric, and body composition parameters, as independent variables, was performed for both gender separately. A cross-validation study was also performed to determine the accuracy of the prediction equation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Whereas HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt; was not significantly different between males (121.5±18.3 bpm) and females (117.6±17.1 bpm), it differently correlated with physical and performance parameters. Therefore, two sex-specific equations were developed including 6-MWT&lt;sub&gt;HR&lt;/sub&gt; and HR&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.69 and 0.65 and root mean square errors of 8.8 and 10.1 bpm for females and males, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, in female and male obese adults, the 6-MWT might be used to predict HR at IVT. These outcomes are useful to prescribe optimal physical activity intensity when gold standard methods (e.g. gas exchange analysis) are unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5135.short?rss=1</link><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5135.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>R.

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915a:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;

It has been observed that the number of phonemes in languages in use today tends to decrease with increasing distance from Africa. A previous formal model has recently reproduced the observed cline, but under two strong assumptions. Here we tackle the question of whether an alternative explanation for the worldwide phonemic cline is possible, by using alternative assumptions. The answer is affirmative. We show this by formalizing a proposal, following Atkinson, that this pattern may be due to a repeated bottleneck effect and phonemic loss. In our simulations, low-density populations lose phonemes during the Out-of-Africa dispersal of modern humans. Our results reproduce the observed global cline for the number of phonemes. In addition, we also detect a cline of phonemic diversity and reproduce it using our simulation model. We suggest how future work could determine whether the previous model or the new one (or even a combination of them) is valid. Simulations also show that the clines can still be present even 300 kyr after the Out-of-Africa dispersal, which is contrary to some previous claims which were not supported by numerical simulations.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84549:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joaquim Pérez-Losada, Joaquim Fort&lt;/p&gt;

In the last decades, the use of zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) in biomedical research has increased. Anaesthesia is daily used in fish during experimental procedures to avoid discomfort, stress or pain. Also, fish welfare and the reliability of results can be compromised if an unsuitable anaesthetic protocol is used. Therefore, we aimed to refine anaesthetic protocols to be used in adult zebrafish by evaluating the efficacy of different anaesthetics, used alone or in combination. For that, zebrafish were randomly assigned to 8 different groups: 100 μg/mLMS-222 (MS); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate (E); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (E+L); 1.25 μg/mL propofol (P); 1.25 μg/mL propofol + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (P+L); 100 μg/mL ketamine (K); 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine (K+M); and 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine/3.125 μg/mL atipamezole (K+M/A). The animals were placed in an anaesthetic water bath, then, the following parameters were registered: time for equilibrium loss and anaesthesia induction, loss of sensitivity to soft and painful stimuli, respiratory rate, recovery time, and activity after recovery. The combined forms of E+L, P+L and K+M were the fastest to induce a surgical anaesthetic stage. Nevertheless, E+L induced respiratory depression, while K+M was shown to have the longer recovery time compared to MS-222, even when atipamezole was added. In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094071:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tânia Martins, Enoque Diniz, Luís M.

In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222.</content></content></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/764?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/764?rss=1</originId><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><author><name>Ghadimi, A.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543e:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Minashima, Thorsten Kirsch&lt;/p&gt;

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219d:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vinoth K.

In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility. Children completed the STT-CV and four established measures of executive functions that assessed working memory, inhibitory control and task switching. Results showed the expected age-based differences in completion times for both parts of the STT-CV (Trail A and Trail B). Children’s performance on the STT-CV correlated significantly with all four measures of executive functions. After controlling for the effects of chronological age, completion times for Trail B remained correlated with most other measures of executive functions. These findings provide emerging evidence for the utility of the STT-CV, and highlight the need for designing and using appropriate variants of the TMT in the behavioural assessment of cognitive flexibility in developmentally and culturally diverse populations.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94a:7cfe07d6</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amy Y.

Deviance sensitivity is the specific response to a surprising stimulus, one that violates expectations set by the past stimulation stream. In audition, deviance sensitivity is often conflated with stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA), the decrease in responses to a common stimulus that only partially generalizes to other, rare stimuli. SSA is usually measured using oddball sequences, where a common (standard) tone and a rare (deviant) tone are randomly intermixed. However, the larger responses to a tone when deviant does not necessarily represent deviance sensitivity. Deviance sensitivity is commonly tested using a control sequence in which many different tones serve as the standard, eliminating the expectations set by the standard (&apos;deviant among many standards&apos;). When the response to a tone when deviant (against a single standard) is larger than the responses to the same tone in the control sequence, it is concluded that true deviance sensitivity occurs. In primary auditory cortex of anesthetized rats, responses to deviants and to the same tones in the control condition are comparable in size. We recorded local field potentials and multiunit activity from the auditory cortex of awake, freely moving rats, implanted with 32-channel drivable microelectrode arrays and using telemetry. We observed highly significant SSA in the awake state. Moreover, the responses to a tone when deviant were significantly larger than the responses to the same tone in the control condition. These results establish the presence of true deviance sensitivity in primary auditory cortex in awake rats.</description><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f44:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Polterovich, Maciej M.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><unread>True</unread><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

By demonstrating the intrinsic diversity of skeletal muscles, these data provide a resource for studying the mechanisms of tissue specialization.</content></summary><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abdaa2b2:1ef99c7:2835af05</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</link><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</originId><author><name>Vignieri, S.</name></author><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-g?rss=1</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><keywords><item>Anatomy, Morphology, Biomechanics, Ecology</item></keywords><fingerprint>46d77a85</fingerprint><published>1525974002000</published><title>Big mamas matter for fish</title><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.7.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7dc:93d646dc</id><unread>True</unread><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04247-z</link><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04247-z</originId><author><name>Heng Wang</name></author><crawled>1525771811096</crawled><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/kimHSBv3wQI/s41467-018-04247-z</href></item></alternate><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04247-z</href></item></canonical><fingerprint>73ad1a49</fingerprint><published>1525762800000</published><title>Supramolecular Kandinsky circles with high antibacterial activity</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supramolecular Kandinsky circles with high antibacterial activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular Kandinsky circles with high antibacterial activity, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04247-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04247-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nested structures are common throughout nature and art, yet remain challenging synthetic targets in supramolecular chemistry.
