Background &lt;p&gt;Asthma is the most common chronic disease during pregnancy and it may have influence on pregnancy outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;Our goal was to assess the association between maternal asthma and the perinatal risks as well as possible effects of asthma medication.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The study was based on a nationwide Finnish register-based cohort between the years 1996 and 2012 in the Drug and Pregnancy Database. The register data comprised 962 405 singleton live and stillbirths, 898 333 (93.3%) pregnancies in mothers with neither confirmed asthma nor use of asthma medication (controls), and 26 674 (2.8%) pregnancies with confirmed maternal asthma. 71% of mothers with asthma used asthma medication. The diagnosis of asthma was based on the mothers’ right for subsidised medication which is carefully evaluated by strict criteria including pulmonary function testing. Odds ratio was used in comparison. Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia. Asthma treatment reduces the risk of preterm delivery, but it does not seem to reduce other complications such as perinatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197593</originId><fingerprint>aaafbad4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197593</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mari Kemppainen, Anna-Maria Lahesmaa-Korpinen, Paula Kauppi, Martti Virtanen, Suvi M.

Premature birth (PB), low birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), neonatal death were the main outcome measures.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Maternal asthma was associated with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for perinatal mortality 1.24 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.46), preterm birth 1.18 (1.11 to 1.25), low birth weight 1.29 (1.21 to 1.37), fetal growth restriction (SGA) 1.32, (1.24 to 1.40), and asphyxia 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17). Asthma treatment reduced the increased risk of preterm birth aOR 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.96) but mothers with treated asthma had higher risks of fetal growth restriction (SGA) aOR 1.26 (1.10 to 1.45), and asphyxia aOR 1.37 (1.17 to 1.61) than mothers with untreated asthma.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Asthma is associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality, preterm birth, low birth weight, fetal growth restriction (SGA), and asphyxia. Asthma treatment reduces the risk of preterm delivery, but it does not seem to reduce other complications such as perinatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Maternal asthma is associated with increased risk of perinatal mortality</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526677200000</updated></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1632bc91d70:15ebbb4:93d646dc</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313809v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Aguirre-Plans, J.</name></author><published>1525417200000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><engagement>1</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/313809</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525447990640</crawled><description>The traditional drug discovery paradigm has shaped around the idea of &amp;quot;one target, one disease&amp;quot;.

Background &lt;p&gt;Obstetric complications and maternal deaths can be prevented through safe delivery process. Facility based delivery significantly reduces maternal mortality by increasing women’s access to skilled personnel attendance. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, most deliveries take place without skilled attendants and outside health facilities. Utilization of facility-based delivery is affected by socio-cultural norms and several other factors including cost, long distance, accessibility and availability of quality services. This study examined country-level variations of the self-reported causes of not choosing to deliver at a health facility.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional data on 37,086 community dwelling women aged between 15–49 years were collected from DHS surveys in Ethiopia (n = 13,053) and Nigeria (n = 24,033). Outcome variables were the self-reported causes of not delivering at health facilities which were regressed against selected sociodemographic and community level determinants. In total eight items complaints were identified for non-use of facility delivery: 1) Cost too much 2) Facility not open, 3) Too far/no transport, 4) don’t trust facility/poor service, 5) No female provider, 6) Husband/family didn’t allow, 7) Not necessary, 8) Not customary. Multivariable regression methods were used for measuring the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In both countries a large proportion of the women mentioned facility delivery as not necessary, 54.9% (52.3–57.9) in Nigeria and 45.4% (42.0–47.5) in Ethiopia. Significant urban-rural variations were observed in the prevalence of the self-reported causes of non-utilisation. Women in the rural areas are more likely to report delivering at health facility as not customary/not necessary and healthy facility too far/no transport. However, urban women were more likely to complain that husband/family did not allow and that the costs were too high.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Women in the rural were more likely to regard facility delivery as unnecessary and complain about transportation and financial difficulties. In order to achieving the maternal mortality related targets, addressing regional disparities in accessing maternal healthcare services should be regarded as a priority of health promotion programs in Nigeria and Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</originId><fingerprint>84b954f9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196896</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanni Yaya, Ghose Bishwajit, Olalekan A.

Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased &lt;i&gt;TFR2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of &lt;i&gt;HAMP&lt;/i&gt; and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</originId><fingerprint>c9382993</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197863</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul A.

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</originId><fingerprint>521a0791</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01).

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employee’s perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managers’ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managers’ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>The importance of manager support for the mental health and well-being of ambulance personnel</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527109200000</updated></item><item><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1635f746fef:d8bc07:f3bf0074</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00854</link><author><name>Nir Gavish, Chun Liu, Bob Eisenberg</name></author><published>1526270400000</published><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b00854/20180514/images/medium/jp-2018-00854k_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00854&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis.

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</originId><fingerprint>87853ac7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196953</originId><fingerprint>6383ce2b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196953</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) urgently requires effective treatment. Bleomycin-induced lung injury models are characterized by initial inflammation and secondary fibrosis, consistent with the pathological features of IPF. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) exhibit good differentiation potential and paracrine activity and are thus ideal for cell-based clinical therapies. The therapeutic effects of hAECs on lung fibrosis are attributed to many factors. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with hAECs to provide suggestions for their clinical use.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original studies describing hAEC therapy in animal bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. After quality assessments, the number and species of experimental animals, bleomycin dose, hAEC source and dosage, time and route of administration of transplanted cells in animals, and time animals were euthanized in nine controlled preclinical studies were summarized. Ashcroft scores, lung collagen contents, inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantitatively and/or qualitatively analyzed in this review. Publication bias was also assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Each of the nine preclinical studies have unique characteristics regarding hAEC use. Ashcroft scores and lung collagen contents were decreased following hAEC transplantation in bleomycin-injured mice. Histopathology was also improved in most studies following treatment with hAECs. hAECs modulated macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells and the mRNA or protein levels of cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin) in lung tissues of bleomycin-injured mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;hAECs alleviate and reverse the progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice and may represent a new clinical treatment for IPF. hAECs exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by modulating macrophage, neutrophil, T cell, dendritic cell and related cytokine levels in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass. Further work is needed to grasp the virulence and fitness mechanisms adopted by &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; causing APN, and hence develop new therapeutic and prophylactic approaches.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196260</originId><fingerprint>c9c4c15a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196260</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arianna Pompilio, Valentina Crocetta, Vincenzo Savini, Dezemona Petrelli, Marta Di Nicola, Silvia Bucco, Luigi Amoroso, Mario Bonomini, Giovanni Di Bonaventura&lt;/p&gt;

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</originId><fingerprint>ce7e2562</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197458</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197954</originId><fingerprint>813c6442</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197954</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cole C.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a cornerstone in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma (MM) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Yet, prolonged GC use is hampered by deleterious GC-related side effects and the emergence of GC resistance. To tackle and overcome these GC-related problems, the applicability of selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators was studied, in search of fewer side-effects and at least equal therapeutic efficacy as classic GCs. Compound A (CpdA) is a prototypical example of such a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator and does not support GR-mediated transactivation. Here, we examined whether the combination of CpdA with the classic GC dexamethasone (Dex) may improve GC responsiveness of MM and ALL cell lines. We find that the combination of Dex and CpdA does not substantially enhance GC-mediated cell killing. In line, several apoptosis hallmarks, such as caspase 3/7 activity, PARP cleavage and the levels of cleaved-caspase 3 remain unchanged upon combining Dex with CpdA. Moreover, we monitor no additional inhibition of cell proliferation and the homologous downregulation of GR is not counteracted by the combination of Dex and CpdA. In addition, CpdA is unable to modulate Dex-liganded GR transactivation and transrepression, yet, Dex-mediated transrepression is also aberrant in these lymphoid cell lines. Together, transrepression-favoring compounds, alone or combined with GCs, do not seem a valid strategy in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</originId><fingerprint>5db29854</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197000</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dorien Clarisse, Karlien Van Wesemael, Jan Tavernier, Fritz Offner, Ilse M.

Fish, birds, insects and robots frequently swim or fly in groups. During their three dimensional collective motion, these agents do not stop, they avoid collisions by strong short-range repulsion, and achieve group cohesion by weak long-range attraction. In a minimal model that is isotropic, and continuous in both space and time, we demonstrate that (i) adjusting speed to a preferred value, combined with (ii) radial repulsion and an (iii) effective long-range attraction are sufficient for the stable ordering of autonomously moving agents in space. Our results imply that beyond these three rules ordering in space requires no further rules, for example, explicit velocity alignment, anisotropy of the interactions or the frequent reversal of the direction of motion, friction, elastic interactions, sticky surfaces, a viscous medium, or vertical separation that prefers interactions within horizontal layers. Noise and delays are inherent to the communication and decisions of all moving agents. Thus, next we investigate their effects on ordering in the model. First, we find that the amount of noise necessary for preventing the ordering of agents is not sufficient for destroying order. In other words, for realistic noise amplitudes the transition between order and disorder is rapid. Second, we demonstrate that ordering is more sensitive to displacements caused by delayed interactions than to uncorrelated noise (random errors). Third, we find that with changing interaction delays the ordered state disappears at roughly the same rate, whereas it emerges with different rates. In summary, we find that the model discussed here is simple enough to allow a fair understanding of the modeled phenomena, yet sufficiently detailed for the description and management of large flocks with noisy and delayed interactions.

Direct coupling analysis (DCA) is popular for intra-protein contact prediction, but extending it to inter-protein contact prediction is challenging since it requires too many interlogs (i.e., interacting homologs) to be effective, which cannot be easily fulfilled especially for a putative interacting protein pair in eukaryotes. We show that deep learning, even trained by only intra-protein contact maps, works much better than DCA for inter-protein contact prediction.

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</originId><fingerprint>2c6b7423</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197814</originId><fingerprint>1bb0ca17</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197814</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</originId><fingerprint>46fbfa4e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16320cb9831:433fd4:5785ab88</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05007-1</link><author><name>Francesco Fuso Nerini</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05007-1</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><engagement>2</engagement><published>1525244400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05007-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05007-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs</description><crawled>1525263603761</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>c6a06b6b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05007-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs, Published online: 02 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05007-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05007-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Shore up support for climate action using SDGs</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Shore up support for climate action using SDGs</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1632be4b404:1618cdf:93d646dc</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314716v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Lun, X.-K.</name></author><published>1525417200000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><engagement>5</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/04/314716</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525449798660</crawled><description>Kinase and phosphatase overexpression drives tumorigenesis and drug resistance in many cancer types.

The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YvqYr2rgaRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</link><crawled>1525111333970</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</originId><fingerprint>b2c4d1ff</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/YvqYr2rgaRA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Camilo Barbosa, Robert Beardmore, Hinrich Schulenburg, Gunther Jansen&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;≤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</originId><fingerprint>989bb534</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michelle L.

We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740 eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly older (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Plants trauma was the primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of pathogen type (the most common was &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; genus, followed by &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups 1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (&gt;7 days) was significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic patients, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10 years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, the diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor that affect the severity of fungal keratitis. Corneal re-epithelialization was significantly delayed after PKP in the diabetic patients, especially with the duration ≥10 years.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196741</originId><fingerprint>3947e2eb</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196741</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Dan, Qingjun Zhou, Hualei Zhai, Jun Cheng, Lei Wan, Cheng Ge, Lixin Xie&lt;/p&gt;

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</originId><fingerprint>288c5762</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197187</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

Background and purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis is one of the most common chronic metabolic diseases, but detection and treatment rates are low. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the correlation between frontal skull Hounsfield unit (HU) values from brain computed tomography (CT) scans and T-scores of the lumbar spine and femoral neck from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with &amp;lt; 1 year between brain CT and DXA scans were included in the study. The average frontal skull HU value used for analysis was defined as the average of four HU values of the frontal bone. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine the HU values of the frontal skull for predicting osteoporosis. The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between skull HU value and T-score (β = 105.06, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.343). The mean HU value in subjects with osteoporosis was 515, and the optimal cutoff value for the prediction of osteoporosis was 610 HU (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.744–0.806, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Clinical brain CT scans can assist in the detection of osteoporosis, and patients with an HU value &amp;lt; 610 as determined via brain CT may be considered for further evaluation for possible osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197336</originId><fingerprint>7f1847f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197336</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Min Kyun Na, Yu Deok Won, Choong Hyun Kim, Jae Min Kim, Jin Hwan Cheong, Je Il Ryu, Myung-Hoon Han&lt;/p&gt;

The frontal skull HU value with the highest sensitivity and specificity was considered the optimal cutoff value.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 899 patients who underwent both brain CT and DXA scans at a single institution were enrolled. Average skull HU values differed significantly among patients in different bone mineral density categories (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between skull HU value and T-score (β = 105.06, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.343). The mean HU value in subjects with osteoporosis was 515, and the optimal cutoff value for the prediction of osteoporosis was 610 HU (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.744–0.806, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Clinical brain CT scans can assist in the detection of osteoporosis, and patients with an HU value &amp;lt; 610 as determined via brain CT may be considered for further evaluation for possible osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Opportunistic osteoporosis screening via the measurement of frontal skull Hounsfield units derived from brain computed tomography images</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525986000000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7216:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</link><author><name>Sherif Ramadan</name></author><published>1526677200000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;
Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</originId><fingerprint>559650b6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

A collaboration between the University of Helsinki, LifeArc (which looks to be one of the small companies in the former Stevenage pharma campus) and Cyclofluidic reports development of inhibitors against hepsin, a serine protease enzyme that is a potential cancer target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so uncontroversial. The same group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/onc2015248&quot;&gt;had identified&lt;/a&gt; a micromolar hepsin inhibitor from some late-1990s urokinase inhibitor chemical matter, but this compound (naturally) still had activity against urokinase. The goal was to improve potency while working away from urokinase, which is just the sort of thing that med-chem teams everywhere spend their efforts on. The enzyme seems to need an amidine/guanadine functional group for potency, and a screen of commercially available derivatives gave another micromolar hit with less urokinase activity as a new starting point. 142 new compounds were prepared, optimizing along until a final compound was reached with 22 nM potency and 200x more selectivity in the counterscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is good: that’s what a team of medicinal chemists are there to do. What makes this paper interesting (and those who have heard of Cyclofluidic will have already caught on) is that the chemistry was automated in a flow reactor, and the enzyme assay results were fed back into the software which generated SAR predictions for the next round of synthesis. Importantly, the screening assay is part of the automated system as well, and the entire loop (synthesis/purification/assay) is claimed to take around 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this actually worked was that the automated system would run through a particular SAR space, generating a series of compounds, and at that point the humans involved would have a look at how things were going. Subsequent runs might include new SAR building blocks or changes to the algorithms that evaluated the results. So it’s not like they walked away for a weekend and came back 142 compounds later to a selective nanomolar inhibitor – but neither is it the case that people made all these compounds and selected the next ones to make, either. This was machine-assisted compound development, very much analogous to what Gary Kasparov has termed “centaur” chess, where humans evaluate their ideas with the aid of software to come up with even stronger moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be noted that the chemistry involved was very straightforward (amide and sulfonamide formation, for the most part) and the assays were quite robust. This was close (as have been the other things reported in this vein) to a best-case example for such closed-loop automated SAR work, but then again these are early days. I also noticed that several of the co-authors on the paper now have different addresses, which makes one wonder how long ago this project was actually done. My point is that automated synthesis (thanks to human ingenuity) is getting better all the time, as are the methods for in-line assays and especially those for evaluation of chemical space and SAR. Thanks to human ingenuity, we are very likely going to be freeing up time to apply that ingenuity to other things than banging out obvious SAR compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, though, you are a human chemist (as so many of my readers are, to steal a joke from G. K. Chesterton), and you feel that you are watching your livelihood being stolen right in front of your eyes, consider what in this case the machines are taking from you. You are being deprived of the chance to do some of the most boring chemistry in the world in the most routine fashion imaginable. My own feelings are that any machine that takes away from me the necessity to crank out 142 amide reactions by hand is welcome to it. This is the med-chem equivalent of doing the laundry, and I have a machine for that, too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Chemical News</item></keywords><title>A Closed Loop</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>This is not a paper that’s going to make everyone who reads it happy, but it needs to be read anyway.

Team SA involves a common perspective between two or more individuals regarding current environmental events, their meaning, and projected future status. Team SA has been theorized to be important for resuscitation team effectiveness. Accordingly, multidimensional frameworks of observable behaviors relevant to resuscitation teams are needed to understand more deeply the nature of team SA, its implications for team effectiveness, and whether it can be trained. A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196825</originId><fingerprint>224b7963</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196825</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas A.

A seven-dimension team resuscitation SA framework was developed following a literature review and consensus process using a modified Delphi approach with a group of content experts. We applied a pre-post design within a day-long team training program involving four video-recorded simulated resuscitation events and 42 teams across Canada. The first and fourth events represented “pre” and “post” training events, respectively. Teams were scored on SA five times within each 15-minute event. Distractions were introduced to investigate whether SA scores would be affected. The current study provides initial construct validity evidence for a new measure of SA and explicates SA&apos;s role in resuscitation teams.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A taxonomy and rating system to measure situation awareness in resuscitation teams</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526331600000</updated></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395cb:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/726?rss=1</originId><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><published>1526578752000</published><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>519</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/726.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>fe227380</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/726?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Meeting resistance</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/726?rss=1</link></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636d63a23d:48fc37d:2835af05</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26137-6</link><author><name>Yue-Qin Song</name></author><published>1526540400000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Identification and tissue distribution of chemosensory protein and odorant binding protein genes in &lt;i&gt;Tropidothorax elegans&lt;/i&gt;

Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules are critical to adaptive immune defence mechanisms in vertebrate species and are encoded by highly polymorphic genes. Polymorphic sites are located close to the ligand-binding groove and entail MHC-I alleles with distinct binding specificities. Some efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between polymorphism and protein stability. However, less is known about the relationship between polymorphism and MHC-I co-evolutionary constraints. Using Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we found that co-evolution analysis accurately pinpoints structural contacts, although the protein family is restricted to vertebrates and comprises less than five hundred species, and that the co-evolutionary signal is mainly driven by cross-species changes, and not intra-species polymorphism. Moreover, we show that polymorphic sites in human preferentially avoid co-evolving residues, as well as residues involved in protein stability. These results suggest that sites displaying high polymorphism may also have been selected during vertebrates’ evolution to avoid those under co-evolutionary constraints and thereby maximize their mutability.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5R4fGWtz6gQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006188</link><crawled>1526935170348</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006188</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006188</originId><fingerprint>445a95eb</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5R4fGWtz6gQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linda Dib, Nicolas Salamin, David Gfeller&lt;/p&gt;

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197847</originId><fingerprint>e5431d78</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197847</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eugénie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, Hervé Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

Attempts to reduce this redundancy have focused on visualizing pathway overlap or merging pathways, but the resulting pathways may be of heterogeneous sizes and cover multiple biological functions. Efforts have also been made to deal with redundancy in pathway data by consolidating enriched pathways into a number of clusters or concepts. We present an alternative approach, which generates pathway subsets capable of covering all of genes presented within either pathway databases or enrichment results, generating substantial reductions in redundancy. Results: We propose a method that uses set cover to reduce pathway redundancy, without merging pathways. The proposed approach considers three objectives: removal of pathway redundancy, controlling pathway size and coverage of the gene set. By applying set cover to the ConsensusPathDB dataset we were able to produce a reduced set of pathways, representing 100% of the genes in the original data set with 74% less redundancy, or 95% of the genes with 88% less redundancy. We also developed an algorithm to simplify enrichment data and applied it to a set of enriched osteoarthritis pathways, revealing that within the top ten pathways, five were redundant subsets of more enriched pathways. Applying set cover to the enrichment results removed these redundant pathways allowing more informative pathways to take their place. Conclusion: Our method provides an alternative approach for handling pathway redundancy, while ensuring that the pathways are of homogeneous size and gene coverage is maximised. Pathways are not altered from their original form, allowing biological knowledge regarding the data set to be directly applicable. We demonstrate the ability of the algorithms to prioritise redundancy reduction, pathway size control or gene set coverage. The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>4702538</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: The consolidation of pathway databases, such as KEGG[1], Reactome[2]and ConsensusPathDB[3], has generated widespread biological interest, however the issue of pathway redundancy impedes the use of these consolidated datasets.

The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Using set theory to reduce redundancy in pathway sets [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33bb2:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/467?rss=1</link><author><name>Glinos, K.</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/467?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>28</engagement><published>1525369184000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/467.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>b519cfe7</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/467?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Editorials</item></keywords><title>Global data meet EU rules</title><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><memes><item><id>topic/tech_en/meme/221a1600-4c7c-11e8-aa13-0a580a0c0366</id><score>0.3222834511061565</score><label>GDPR EU Facebook PS</label></item></memes></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163693c73d4:4056c3c:3dd877af</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38361</link><author><name>NA</name></author><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38361</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526428800000</published><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38361</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526478959572</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>3e581cfd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38361</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Epidemiology and Global Health</item></keywords><title>Correction: Quantifying the contribution of Plasmodium falciparum malaria to febrile illness amongst African children</title><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163695d2a76:42739a3:2835af05</id><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Ring-Opening_Hydroarylation_of_Monosubstituted_Cyclopropanes_Enabled_by_Hexafluoroisopropanol/6265499</link><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1526428800000</published><origin><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><crawled>1526481103478</crawled><description>Ring-opening hydroarylation of cyclopropanes is typically limited to substrates bearing a donor-acceptor motif.

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</originId><fingerprint>1730ca12</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Child marriage harms girls’ health and hinders progress toward development goals. Randomized studies have shown that providing financial incentives for girls’ education can effectively delay marriage, but larger-scale interventions are needed in light of slow progress toward curbing the practice. Many sub-Saharan African countries eliminated primary school tuition fees over the past two decades, resulting in massive increases in enrolment. We measured the effect of these policies on the probability of primary school completion and of marriage before 15 and 18 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used Demographic and Health Surveys to assemble a dataset of women born between 1970 and 2000 in 16 countries. These data were merged with longitudinal information on the timing of tuition fee elimination in each country. We estimated the impact of fee removal using fixed effects regression to compare changes in the prevalence of child marriage over time between women who were exposed to tuition-free primary schooling and those who were not.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The removal of tuition fees led to modest average declines in the prevalence of child marriage across all of the treated countries. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between countries. The prevalence of child marriage declined by 10–15 percentage points in Ethiopia and Rwanda following tuition elimination but we found no evidence that the removal of tuition fees had an impact on child marriage rates in Cameroon or Malawi. Reductions in child marriage were not consistently accompanied by increases in the probability of primary school completion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Eliminating tuition fees led to reductions in child marriage on a national scale in most countries despite challenges with implementation.

Adverse Reaction to Metal Debris (ARMD) is a major cause of implant failure leading to revision surgery in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasties. However, the pathogenesis and its association to implant wear are poorly understood and previous studies have yielded discrepant results. We sought to investigate the associations between histological findings, whole blood and synovial fluid metal ion concentrations and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations in patients with MoM total hip replacements and hip resurfacings revised for ARMD. 107 hips in total were included in our study. Of these, 87 were total hip replacements and 20 were hip resurfacings, respectively. We found that whole blood, synovial fluid and periprosthetic tissue metal concentrations correlated poorly with histological findings. We suggest that the lack of a clear association between histological findings and wear measures in the present study as well as in previous studies is mostly influenced by variability in patient susceptibility. However, patients presenting with perivascular lymphocytic infiltration had lower chromium concentration in their periprosthetic tissues than patients with no perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. This may reflect the role of metal hypersensitivity in implant failure in these patients. Patients with total hip replacements evinced more necrosis and lymphocytic infiltration in their tissues than patients with hip resurfacings. This suggests that trunnion wear debris is more cytotoxic and/or immunogenic than bearing wear debris leading to higher failure rates seen in patients with total hip replacements.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</originId><fingerprint>56e4495e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197614</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lari Lehtovirta, Aleksi Reito, Jyrki Parkkinen, Sirpa Peräniemi, Jouko Vepsäläinen, Antti Eskelinen&lt;/p&gt;

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006107</link><crawled>1526580501938</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006107</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006107</originId><fingerprint>f2cc0daa</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2a3YD9EnPsk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Enzyme sequestration by the substrate: An analysis in the deterministic and stochastic domains</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526590800000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761234:93d646dc</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</link><author><name>Yujin Myung</name></author><published>1526936400000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yujin Myung, Yousung Son, Tae-hyun Nam, Eunyoung Kang, Eun-Kyu Kim, In Ah Kim, Keun-Yong Eom, Chan Yeong Heo, Jae Hoon Jeong&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;The use of immediate breast reconstruction and adjuvant radiation therapy is increasing in breast cancer patients.

Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluate shape changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion of radiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in the short- and long-term aesthetic results between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When performing immediate autologous breast reconstruction, 14% volume overcorrection is recommended for patients in whom adjuvant radiation therapy is anticipated to improve aesthetic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</originId><fingerprint>8a85ba15</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yujin Myung, Yousung Son, Tae-hyun Nam, Eunyoung Kang, Eun-Kyu Kim, In Ah Kim, Keun-Yong Eom, Chan Yeong Heo, Jae Hoon Jeong&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; origins of ALL.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197408</originId><fingerprint>68c38dc2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197408</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jeremy M.

The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5%), 328 (62.1%) and 92 (17.4%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3%), 200 (51.7%) and 89 (23.0%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,N = 336) = 6.53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true “One Health” approach.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198019</originId><fingerprint>f1dd2015</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198019</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Solveig Sølverød Mo, Anne Margrete Urdahl, Knut Madslien, Marianne Sunde, Live L.

Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>116db5d0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/282269v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function.

The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of CPP-ACP and fluorides compared with fluorides monotherapy on patients with early caries lesions. The Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases up to August 2017 were scanned, with no restrictions. Studies satisfied the guideline of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the patients with early caries lesions and data considering the efficacy of fluorides and CPP-ACP versus fluorides alone were selected. There was no language restriction during the literature search process, however, only papers in English or Chinese were included during the selection process. Outcome variables include laser fluorescence, quantitative light-induced fluorescence, lesion area and visual inspection scores. Mean differences were calculated during the data extraction process. Ten studies including 559 patients were selected in the meta-analysis. Fluorides combined with CPP-ACP achieved the same efficacy for early caries lesions on smooth surfaces compared with fluorides monotherapy (mean difference: -13.90, 95% confidence interval: [-39.25, 11.46], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.28), and the combination treatment showed significantly better efficacy than fluorides monotherapy for occlusal early caries lesions (mean difference: -21.02, 95% confidence interval: [-27.94, -14.10], &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Background &lt;p&gt;Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible. Standard procedures involving immediate collection after birth and snap freezing are often cost prohibitive. We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4°C, as compared to the “gold standard” of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions. Specifically, key inflammatory cytokines were measured in 3 sections, representing three collection conditions. Sections 1 (full thickness) and 2 (excised prior to freezing) were obtained within 40 minutes of delivery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and section 3 (full thickness) was obtained after refrigerating the placenta at 4°C for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 all had comparable concentrations and variability overall in all three section types. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were too low among samples to reliably measure using immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Refrigeration of placentae prior to processing does not appear to compromise detection of these cytokines for purposes of large scale studies.

The largest differences in intraspecific head shape among the &lt;i&gt;Carnivora&lt;/i&gt; order are to be found in dogs. Based on their skull morphotypes, dog breeds are currently classified as dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic and brachycephalic. Due to the fact that some breeds have not been yet defined, this classification is incomplete; moreover, multi-breed studies on the skull morphology of puppies have never been performed. The aim of this work was to verify (i) whether differences in the skull conformation of purebred puppies are already present within the first week of age; (ii) whether radiographic and anatomic measures could be considered interchangeable, and (iii) to possibly classify puppies from non-categorized breeds thanks to their radiographic cranial measurements using neural nets. One hundred and thirty-seven dead puppies aged 0–7 days were examined considering their anatomic and radiographic measures. All linear measures and anatomic indices significantly differed among brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic puppies. Radiographic indices, with the exception of CI, identified the three skull morphotypes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, for all comparisons).

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women).

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</originId><fingerprint>619de92</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197266</originId><fingerprint>2cbc35d8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197266</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</originId><fingerprint>41cf716b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196939</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Background &lt;p&gt;Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6–8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;mRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 ± 0.42 vs. 0.81 ± 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196739</originId><fingerprint>8c9682ae</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196739</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Moritz Messner, Santhosh Kumar Ghadge, Valentina Goetsch, Andreas Wimmer, Jakob Dörler, Gerhard Pölzl, Marc-Michael Zaruba&lt;/p&gt;

Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Upregulation of the aging related LMNA splice variant progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1524862800000</updated></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33ba0:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</link><author><name>Purcell, C.</name></author><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>7</engagement><published>1525369184000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/499.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>c242929f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/499?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Physics</item></keywords><title>Deconstructing time</title><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163066b5c30:86d61e:4e164c41</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03956-9</link><author><name>Xiang Chen</name></author><published>1524812400000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CVD-grown monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in bioabsorbable electronics and biosensors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVD-grown monolayer MoS&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt; in bioabsorbable electronics and biosensors, Published online: 27 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03956-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03956-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Transient electronics entails the capability of electronic components to dissolve or reabsorb in a controlled manner when used in biomedical implants.

Background &lt;p&gt;While dyslipidemia importantly contributes to increased cardiovascular disease risk among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), data on lipid patterns among African adults on ART are limited. We describe the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and associated factors in two HIV clinics in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2014 and enrolled adult patients at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. We recorded patient characteristics, CVD risk factors and anthropometric measurements, using the WHO STEPS validated instrument. Non-fasting samples were taken for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;554 patients were enrolled, 50% at the rural HIV clinic, 72.7% were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 years (36–50); 97.3% were on ART, 84.4% on tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, 17.5% were overweight/obese and 27.8%% had elevated waist/hip ratio. 15.5% had elevated TC, 15.9% reduced HDL-c, 28.7% had elevated TG and 3.8% had elevated TC/HDL-c ratio. Lipid abnormalities were similar in rural and urban patients. Women had significantly higher burden of elevated TC and TG whereas men had higher prevalence of reduced HDL-c. Waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with elevated TC (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17–3.10, p = 0.01) and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio (aOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.38–8.85, p = 0.008). Increasing age was independently associated with elevated TC level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.51–4.59 for age 31–45; aOR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.24–10.95 for age &gt;45 years vs. ≤30 years; p-trend &amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found a moderate burden of dyslipidemia among Malawian adults on ART, which was similar in rural and urban patients but differed significantly between men and women. High waist-hip ratio predicted elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio and may be a practical tool for CVD risk indication in resource limited settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</originId><fingerprint>8aece9d2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197728</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alemayehu Amberbir, Victor Singano, Alfred Matengeni, Zahra Ismail, Gift Kawalazira, Adrienne K.

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PmCDC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PmCyclin B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline. These data suggest that PmChk1 may have important roles in the ovarian maturation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198036</originId><fingerprint>468f5</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198036</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lihua Qiu, Chao Zhao, Pengfei Wang, Sigang Fan, Lulu Yan, Bobo Xie, Shigui Jiang, Shu Wang, Heizhao Lin&lt;/p&gt;

The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries. RNA interference experiments were undertaken to examine the expression of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PmCDC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;PmCyclin B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in the ovaries and hepatopancreas by dsRNA-Chk1 was successful. The localization and level of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR. The Gonadosomatic Index of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; after dsRNA-Chk1 injection was significantly higher than that after injection of dsRNA-GFP or phosphate-buffered saline. These data suggest that PmChk1 may have important roles in the ovarian maturation of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Genomic structure, expression, and functional characterization of checkpoint kinase 1 from &amp;lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527195600000</updated></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d41:3dd877af</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321463v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Bretscher, M.

Pathogen load determines the outcome of many infections, and is a consequence of pathogen multiplication rate, duration of the infection, and inhibition or killing of pathogen by the host (resistance). If these determinants of pathogen load could be quantified then their mechanistic correlates might be determined. In humans the timing of infection is rarely known and treatment cannot usually be withheld to monitor serial changes in pathogen load and host response. Here we present an approach to overcome this and identify potential mechanisms of resistance which control parasite load in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using a mathematical model of longitudinal infection dynamics for orientation, we made individualized estimates of parasite multiplication and growth inhibition in Gambian children at presentation with acute malaria and used whole blood RNA-sequencing to identify their correlates. We identified novel roles for secreted proteases cathepsin G and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) as direct effector molecules which inhibit P. falciparum growth. Cathepsin G acts on the erythrocyte membrane, cleaving surface receptors required for parasite invasion, whilst MMP9 acts on the parasite. In contrast, the type 1 interferon response and expression of CXCL10 (IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) were detrimental to control of parasite growth. Natural variation in iron status and plasma levels of complement factor H were determinants of parasite multiplication rate. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for the dynamic interaction between host and pathogen when seeking to identify correlates of protection, and reveal novel mechanisms controlling parasite growth in humans. This approach could be extended to identify additional mechanistic correlates of natural- and vaccine-induced immunity to malaria and other infections.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321463v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>bb915cc0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321463v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Improved methods are needed to identify host mechanisms which directly protect against human infectious diseases in order to develop better vaccines and therapeutics.

The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (&lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage. Interestingly, while only a few adult bats visited the trapped bat, in every trial all or most of the eight young males in the colony would visit the trapped bat without feeding it. To test whether this behavioral difference resulted from age class differences in exploration, we compared responses of the bats to a trapped conspecific versus an inanimate novel object. Some adults and young showed interest in trapped conspecifics, but only the young males explored the novel objects. Additional novel object tests in a second captive colony showed that higher rates of novel object exploration were shown by young of both sexes. Our results corroborate past findings from other mammals and birds that age predicts exploration. If age-dependent exploration is indeed adaptive, then the role of age as a predictor of exploration tendency should depend on species-specific life history traits. Finally, because younger vampire bats also appear to have higher exposure to pathogens such as rabies virus, there may be implications for pathogen transmission if younger and more exploratory vampire bats are more likely to feed on novel hosts.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196889</originId><fingerprint>846ddd5b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196889</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gerald G.

Serum starvation is a routine protocol for synchronizing nuclear donor cells to G0/G1 phase during somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, abrupt serum deprivation can cause serious stress to the cells cultured &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, which might result in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, chromosome damage, and finally reduce the success rate of SCNT. In the present study, the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an effective ER stress-relieving drug, on the nuclear donor cells under serum deprivation condition as well as following SCNT procedures were first assessed in the bovine. The results showed that TUDCA significantly reduced ER stress and cell apoptosis in those nuclear donor cells. Moreover, it significantly decreased the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt;, and increased the level of H3K9 acetylation in nuclear donor cells compared with control group. SCNT reconstructed embryos cloned from TUDCA-treated donor cells showed significantly higher fusion, cleavage, blastocyst formation rate, total cell number in day 7 blastocysts, and lower apoptotic index than that from control group. In addition, the expression of &lt;i&gt;Hdac1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dnmt1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bax&lt;/i&gt; was significantly lower in blastocysts derived from TUDCA-treated donor cells than that from control group.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Visual perceptual training reconfigures post-task resting-state functional connectivity with a feature-representation region</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525899600000</updated></item><item><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1633b312524:2a53a3b:5785ab88</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4132</link><author><name>Zehua Bao</name></author><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4132</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><engagement>8</engagement><published>1525676400000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genome-scale engineering of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; with single-nucleotide precision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-scale engineering of &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; with single-nucleotide precision, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4132&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Efficient genome-scale precision editing in yeast is enabled using CRISPR–Cas9 and homology-directed-repair.</description><crawled>1525706466596</crawled><visual><url>https://media.nature.com/m685/nature-assets/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/images/nbt.4132-F1.jpg</url><width>624</width><height>685</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><fingerprint>87bc2087</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4132</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genome-scale engineering of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; with single-nucleotide precision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-scale engineering of &amp;lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&amp;lt;/i&gt; with single-nucleotide precision, Published online: 07 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4132&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4132&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Efficient genome-scale precision editing in yeast is enabled using CRISPR–Cas9 and homology-directed-repair.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Genome-scale engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with single-nucleotide precision</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>nWAmhAfvfdY6zhQafSMhdWASYooG1IX3uplCe3rnLYA=_1634bb55fd2:55e0c8:f3bf0074</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00402</link><author><name>Fujie Tang, Tatsuhiko Ohto, Taisuke Hasegawa, Wen Jun Xie, Limei Xu, Mischa Bonn, Yuki Nagata</name></author><published>1525924800000</published><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00402&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525816154670</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</originId><fingerprint>eed50c14</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/0-d2BFNTwPU/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001).

Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</originId><fingerprint>b1ebe2f3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</originId><fingerprint>5f110ba6</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

Massive amounts of fake news and conspiratorial content have spread over social media before and after the 2016 US Presidential Elections despite intense fact-checking efforts. How do the spread of misinformation and fact-checking compete? What are the structural and dynamic characteristics of the core of the misinformation diffusion network, and who are its main purveyors? How to reduce the overall amount of misinformation? To explore these questions we built Hoaxy, an open platform that enables large-scale, systematic studies of how misinformation and fact-checking spread and compete on Twitter. Hoaxy captures public tweets that include links to articles from low-credibility and fact-checking sources. We perform &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-core decomposition on a diffusion network obtained from two million retweets produced by several hundred thousand accounts over the six months before the election. As we move from the periphery to the core of the network, fact-checking nearly disappears, while social bots proliferate. The number of users in the main core reaches equilibrium around the time of the election, with limited churn and increasingly dense connections. We conclude by quantifying how effectively the network can be disrupted by penalizing the most central nodes. These findings provide a first look at the anatomy of a massive online misinformation diffusion network.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196087</originId><fingerprint>efe84cda</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196087</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chengcheng Shao, Pik-Mai Hui, Lei Wang, Xinwen Jiang, Alessandro Flammini, Filippo Menczer, Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia&lt;/p&gt;

We use U-statistic theory to derive the asymptotic distribution of the new correlation coefficient, developing additional large and finite sample properties along the way. To establish the admissibility of the REVA statistic, and explore the utility and limitations of our model, we compared it to the most widely used distance based correlation coefficient in a range of simulated conditions, demonstrating that REVA does not depend on an assumption of linearity, and is robust to high levels of noise, high dimensions, and the presence of outliers. We also present an application to real data, applying REVA to determine whether cancer cells with similar genetic profiles also respond similarly to a targeted therapeutic.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330498v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>5a787d50</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330498v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The neighbors principle implicit in any machine learning algorithm says that samples with similar labels should be close to one another in feature space as well.

To establish the admissibility of the REVA statistic, and explore the utility and limitations of our model, we compared it to the most widely used distance based correlation coefficient in a range of simulated conditions, demonstrating that REVA does not depend on an assumption of linearity, and is robust to high levels of noise, high dimensions, and the presence of outliers. We also present an application to real data, applying REVA to determine whether cancer cells with similar genetic profiles also respond similarly to a targeted therapeutic.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>REVA: a rank-based multi-dimensional measure of correlation [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1636a23b7f9:4205be3:3dd877af</id><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao4680?rss=1</link><author><name>Lochmann, T.

We performed high-throughput drug screening of epigenetic-targeted therapies across a large and diverse tumor cell line panel and uncovered the hypersensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to GSK-J4, a small-molecule dual inhibitor of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27) demethylases ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat, X chromosome (UTX), and histone demethylase Jumonji D3 (JMJD3). Mechanistically, GSK-J4 induced neuroblastoma differentiation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with accompanying up-regulation of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and induction of cell death. Retinoic acid (RA)–resistant neuroblastoma cells were sensitive to GSK-J4. In addition, GSK-J4 was effective at blocking the growth of chemorefractory and patient-derived xenograft models of high-risk neuroblastoma in vivo. Furthermore, GSK-J4 and RA combination increased differentiation and ER stress over GSK-J4 effects and limited the growth of neuroblastomas resistant to either drug alone. In &lt;i&gt;MYCN&lt;/i&gt;-amplified neuroblastoma, PUMA induction by GSK-J4 sensitized tumors to the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax, demonstrating that epigenetic-targeted therapies and BCL-2 homology domain 3 mimetics can be rationally combined to treat this high-risk subset of neuroblastoma. Therefore, H3K27 demethylation inhibition is a promising therapeutic target to treat high-risk neuroblastoma, and H3K27 demethylation can be part of rational combination therapies to induce robust antineuroblastoma activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao4680?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>64b33593</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/441/eaao4680?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;High-risk neuroblastoma is often distinguished by amplification of &lt;i&gt;MYCN&lt;/i&gt; and loss of differentiation potential.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In June 2012, the federal government made cuts to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) Program that reduced or eliminated health insurance for refugee claimants in Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the cuts on emergency department (ED) use among patients claiming IFH benefits.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a health records review at two tertiary care EDs in Ottawa. We reviewed all ED visits where an IFH claim was made at triage, for 18 months before and 18 months after the changes to the program on June 30, 2012 (2011–2013). Claims made before and after the cuts were compared in terms of basic demographics, chief presenting complaints, acuity, diagnosis, presence of primary care, and financial status of the claim. Bivariate or multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to yield odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were a total of 612 IFH claims made in the ED from 2011–2013. The demographic characteristics, acuity of presentation and discharge diagnoses were similar during both the before and after periods. Overall, 28.6% fewer claims were made under the IFH program after the cuts. Of the claims made, significantly more were rejected after the cuts than before (13.7% after vs. 3.9% before, adjusted OR 4.28, 95% CI: 2.18–8.40; p&amp;lt;0.05). The majority (75.0%) of rejected claims have not been paid by patients. Fewer patients after the cuts indicated that they had a family physician (20.4% after vs. 30% before, unadjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.44; p&amp;lt;0.05) yet a higher proportion of patients without a family physician were still advised to follow up with their family doctor during the after period (67.2% after vs. 41.8% before, unadjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI: 1.45–5.62; p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of both rejected and subsequently unpaid claims after the IFH cuts in June 2012, as demonstrated in the logistic regression analysis in this health records review, represents a potential barrier to emergency medical care, as well as a new financial burden to be shouldered by patients and hospitals. A reduction in IFH claims in the ED and a reduction in the number of patients with access to a family physician also suggests inadequate primary care for this population, yet this was not reflected in the follow-up advice offered by ED physicians to patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</originId><fingerprint>5f45a0f2</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197282</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Francis Bakewell, Sarah Addleman, Garth Dickinson, Venkatesh Thiruganasambandamoorthy&lt;/p&gt;

The prevalence of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. Probiotics supplementation have been shown to improve metabolic health in humans. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics supplementation on metabolic health and pregnancy complications in pregnant women. The literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and data were synthesized in accordance with standardized guidelines. Ten randomized clinical trials with eligible data were included in our meta-analysis. For pregnant women with GDM, we found negative correlations between probiotics supplementation and fasting serum insulin (OR -2.94, 95%CI [-5.69, -0.20], p = 0.04) and homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (OR -0.65, 95%CI [-1.18, -0.11], p = 0.02). There were no significant correlations between probiotics supplementation and lipid levels in women with GDM, including total cholesterol (OR -2.72, 95%CI [-17.18, 11.74], P = 0.71), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR -0.29, 95%CI [-3.60, 3.03], P = 0.87), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR -0.38, 95%CI [-18.54, 17.79], P = 0.97), or triglycerides (OR -12.83, 95%CI [-36.63, 10.97], P = 0.29). For healthy pregnant women, probiotics supplementation were negatively associated with fasting serum insulin (OR -3.76, 95%CI [-4.29, -3.23], P &amp;lt; 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (OR -0.57, 95%CI [-1.08, -0.06], p = 0.03). However, no significant correlations were observed between probiotics supplementation and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (OR -2.02, 95%CI [-5.56, 1.52], p = 0.26). Thus, our study revealed that probiotics supplementation during pregnancy have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, rather than lipid metabolism among pregnant women.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</originId><fingerprint>218d8e8d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197771</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jia Zheng, Qianyun Feng, Sheng Zheng, Xinhua Xiao&lt;/p&gt;

Isomaltodextrin (IMD) is a novel dietary fiber-like polysaccharide: a type of α-glucan produced from starch using enzymes derived from microorganisms. The results of cohort studies show that dietary fiber can prevent cardiovascular disorders caused by lifestyle-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of excess fat absorption by dietary fiber is known to be one of the mechanisms, and it is also known that the actions of dietary fiber vary depending on factors such as its structure or origin. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory actions of IMD on fat absorption, and analyzed its mechanism of action. In rats, the absorption of fat given by gavage was significantly lower at 1, 2, and 6 hours after IMD administration than after vehicle administration. In humans, IMD was associated with a lesser increase in blood triglycerides in subjects whose blood triglycerides were otherwise apt to rise. We also found by in vitro emulsion studies that IMD, which had no effect on digestive enzyme activity or emulsion formation, stabilized the micro size micelle by inducing enlarged micelle particle size and increased zeta potential. In conclusion, the mechanism of inhibition of fat absorption by IMD may be a delay in micelle particles accessing the intestinal epithelium through changes in the surface structure and the physical properties of the micelle particles.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</originId><fingerprint>c77a2e72</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196802</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ryodai Takagaki, Yuki Ishida, Tsuyoshi Sadakiyo, Yoshifumi Taniguchi, Takeo Sakurai, Hitoshi Mitsuzumi, Hikaru Watanabe, Shigeharu Fukuda, Shimpei Ushio&lt;/p&gt;

Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47&lt;sup&gt;phox&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198082</originId><fingerprint>5334af14</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198082</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Shan Hsieh, Soonho Kwon, Hui Su Lee, Geun Hee Seol&lt;/p&gt;

These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Linalyl acetate prevents hypertension-related ischemic injury</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527282000000</updated></item><item><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163833cf4f7:676583e:2835af05</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0025-7</link><author><name>Monica Vaccari</name></author><published>1526886000000</published><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>119</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIV vaccine candidate activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes is associated with a decreased risk of SIV&lt;sub&gt;mac251&lt;/sub&gt; acquisition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV vaccine candidate activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; monocytes is associated with a decreased risk of SIV&amp;lt;sub&gt;mac251&amp;lt;/sub&gt; acquisition, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0025-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0025-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Distinct monocyte subsets associate with different outcomes of SIV vaccines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xhPIrX0j5lQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1526915200247</crawled><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0025-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0025-7</originId><fingerprint>4ef07ec4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/xhPIrX0j5lQ/s41591-018-0025-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HIV vaccine candidate activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes is associated with a decreased risk of SIV&lt;sub&gt;mac251&lt;/sub&gt; acquisition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV vaccine candidate activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; monocytes is associated with a decreased risk of SIV&amp;lt;sub&gt;mac251&amp;lt;/sub&gt; acquisition, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0025-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0025-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Distinct monocyte subsets associate with different outcomes of SIV vaccines.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xhPIrX0j5lQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0025-7/MediaObjects/41591_2018_25_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>685</width><height>478</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>HIV vaccine candidate activation of hypoxia and the inflammasome in CD14+ monocytes is associated with a decreased risk of SIVmac251 acquisition</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7c9:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-g?rss=1</originId><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.7.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual><fingerprint>9710400a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-g?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Scaling up textiles that cool down</title><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-g?rss=1</link></item><item><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395c2:3dd877af</id><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-e?rss=1</link><author><name>Sugden, A.

The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling regulator, facilitates DNA repair to prevent chromosome abnormalities. Previously, we showed that ATM deficiency led to the 11q23 chromosome translocation, the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemia.

The etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM and ATR, and attenuates its interaction with INO80. The ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 reduces the excessive loading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the breakpoint cluster region.

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</originId><fingerprint>58711df8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Io Antonopoulou, Cameron Hunt, Gabriella Cerullo, Simona Varriale, Alexandra Gerogianni, Vincenza Faraco, Ulrika Rova, Paul Christakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>832b00dd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

The P8 stem-loop region of the &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron, which is known to be hypervariable in size with multiple repeat motifs and created difficulties in alignment, is always excluded in phylogenetic as well as barcode analyses. This region was investigated for species discrimination in 98 taxa of orchids belonging to the tribe Vandeae using in silico mapping of restriction site polymorphism. The length of the P8 regions varied from 200 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Aerides rosea&lt;/i&gt; to 669 nucleotides in &lt;i&gt;Dendrophylax sallei&lt;/i&gt;. Forty two taxa had unique lengths, while as many as eight shared a common length of 521 nucleotides. Of the 35 restriction endonucleases producing digestions in the P8 regions, three, viz., &lt;i&gt;Ags&lt;/i&gt;I, &lt;i&gt;Apo&lt;/i&gt;I and &lt;i&gt;Tsp&lt;/i&gt;DTI turned out to have recognition sites across all the 98 taxa being studied. When their restriction data were combined, 92 taxa could be discriminated leaving three taxon pairs. However, &lt;i&gt;Acampe papillosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aeranthes arachnites&lt;/i&gt; despite having similar restriction sites differed in their P8 lengths. This is the first report on thorough investigation of the P8 region of &lt;i&gt;trn&lt;/i&gt;L intron for search of species specific restriction sites and hence its use as a potential plant DNA barcode.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196680</originId><fingerprint>8165df3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196680</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rajkumar Kishor, G.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). Our findings demonstrate that TIMP1 delays photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into how TIMP1 works in the mouse animal model of RP.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</originId><fingerprint>27e265bd</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hwa Sun Kim, Andrew Vargas, Yun Sung Eom, Justin Li, Kyra L.

Populations with obesity are more likely to fall and exhibit balance instability. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, but there is some evidence that sensory function is impaired during obesity. We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; muscle-nerve preparation was used to record muscle spindle afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of C57/Bl6 male and female mice on a control diet (10% kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 10 weeks (final age 14–15 weeks old). Following HFD feeding, adult mice of both sexes exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to muscle movement. Muscle spindle afferent firing rates during the plateau phase of stretch were significantly lower in both male and female HFD animals as were two measures of dynamic sensitivity (dynamic peak and dynamic index). Muscle spindle afferents in male mice on a HFD were also significantly less likely to entrain to vibration. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</originId><fingerprint>fa5cb79b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196832</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lubayna S.

We compared the responses of C57/Bl6 male and female mice on a control diet (10% kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) for 10 weeks (final age 14–15 weeks old). Following HFD feeding, adult mice of both sexes exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to muscle movement. Muscle spindle afferent firing rates during the plateau phase of stretch were significantly lower in both male and female HFD animals as were two measures of dynamic sensitivity (dynamic peak and dynamic index). Muscle spindle afferents in male mice on a HFD were also significantly less likely to entrain to vibration. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Diet induced obesity alters muscle spindle afferent function in adult mice</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525294800000</updated></item><item><id>bE0mPve90xtDW7Mgx9+xm/gIKXt54qktoOvefuUy0ZI=_16374e904dd:da5d9:ae8b474d</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00688</link><author><name>Man Cao, Guodong Chen, Lina Wang, Pingping Wen, Shaoping Shi</name></author><published>1526616000000</published><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00688/20180518/images/medium/ci-2017-00688b_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00688&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</link><crawled>1526580501938</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</originId><fingerprint>4585a5bf</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NEnghs1B4I8/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP. As a novel approach employing recombinantly expressed PrP and intein-mediated protein ligation, we used N-PrP covalently coupled to beads as a bait for affinity purification. N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions. Moreover, some interactors were found only in either non-AD or AD brain, suggesting aberrant PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; interactions in the pathogenesis of AD.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197659</originId><fingerprint>32ad56e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197659</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Ulbrich, Petra Janning, Ralf Seidel, Jakob Matschke, Anika Gonsberg, Sebastian Jung, Markus Glatzel, Martin Engelhard, Konstanze F.

A group at Merck (Boston) reports a combination of very small-scale automated synthesis with a screening assay in situ (no purification). You may be wondering how that works, or how it can possibly work, especially when you hear that the nanoscale reactions are transition-metal catalyzed. After all, we usually spend a good deal of effort trying to make sure that our assay candidates are cleaned up and (most especially) free of metal contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is the type of protein assay. It’s not a functional readout, which is where the metals can give you all sorts of false positives, but rather just a binding assay, done by mass spec. That’s generally done in an is-anything-there binary mode, but in this paper, they’re actually titrating in the amount of protein to get a rough order of affinities. Still, one strike against that sort of detection has always been “But you’re only measuring binding, not real inhibition, etc.” That’s still true, but now you can always consider going the targeted protein degradation route, in which case all you need is some sort of binder. As mentioned here in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/26/dna-libraries-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;another recent post&lt;/a&gt;, the same consideration applies to DNA-encoded libraries, which also just give you a binding affinity readout – the Merck authors don’t mention this aspect, but it’s a real consideration these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, they did a test with 20 reactions each using amide formation, Suzuki couplings, and Buchwald-Hartwig C-N couplings (which certainly cover a lot of real-world medicinal chemistry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/24/boring-or-the-medicinal-chemists-toolkit&quot;&gt;for better or worse&lt;/a&gt;).  They used the small-scale reaction setup to screen conditions for the latter two, in a smaller-scale version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. In each case, they also synthesized the products on a 20mg scale and purified them by traditional means, in order to compare them with the nanoscale assay results. (These all produced compounds in known kinase inhibitor space, which I’m afraid is also pretty realistic.) And the correlation was strong: the affinity-mass-spec assay could indeed pick out the potent compounds (as it should) without giving false positives along the way (since you’re looking for the particular mass signature of the product associated with the enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this confirmation in hand, the group then took one of the intermediates and coupled it in each individual well of a 384 plate after an automated reaction conditions screen. They got 345 products and rank-ordered them by titrating in CHK1 protein, with a mass spec readout each time, and identified three new potent binders. These reactions are done on about 0.05mg of material each, so you can plow through quite a few of them without plowing through a lot of starting material, and generate a lot of SAR data rather quickly. The reaction screening is a key part of the process – taking robust but generic coupling conditions across that same 384 set only gave 158 products (and thus missed several nanomolar inhibitors). Overall, to optimize the 384 set and assay them took 3114 reactions, consuming about 120mg of the starting material. You are not going to be able to do that by hand. I don’t care how much of a machine you are in the lab, you’re not more of a machine than a machine is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the authors note, machine-learning algorithms may eventually make it easier to navigate both reaction condition space and SAR space, but for now, we really have to attack these things empirically, and this (in general) seems like the way to do it. Small scale, highly automated, optimized, high-throughput: you’re not going to be able to sort things so thoroughly any other way. And since we often have to resort to brute force, we should be letting the machines take that on whenever possible, because brute force is exactly what they do the best. That was proven on the high-throughput screening end of the business many years ago, and it’s true on the compound synthesis end of things, too. Bring ’em on.&lt;/p&gt;

That was after the Merck/Incyte failure of a combination of Keytruda and Incyte’s IDO (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/24/6795&quot;&gt;indole 2,3-dioxygenase&lt;/a&gt;) inhibitor. That mechanism was supposed to increase T-cell activity, but the trial showed it to have no effect on Keytruda’s efficacy at all. Earlier IDO trials had not gone well for other companies, but there had been hopes for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there were hopes for another inhibitor that Bristol-Myers Squibb had bought from Flexus (which is quite a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;tangled tale&lt;/a&gt; in itself). I wondered at the end of that last post if the Merck/Incyte failure meant that the BMS/Flexus effort was doomed as well – everyone who follows this area was wondering the same thing – but as some readers pointed out, the Flexus inhibitor did have a somewhat different mechanism of action, so there was at least a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scratch that. Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AndyBiotech/status/990975230322585605&quot;&gt;Andy Biotech&lt;/a&gt; noticed (and posted on Twitter) that the two Phase III trials had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2018/04/30/bristol-myers-latest-to-drop-ido-studies-in-wake-of-incyte-failure/&quot;&gt;quietly been scrapped&lt;/a&gt; on clinicaltrials.gov. So I think we can say that (at least as currently configured) the excursion into IDO inhibitors has been a costly mistake. And remember, as is almost always the case in these things, that it didn’t look like it was going to be any such thing. IDO inhibition made sense in terms of what we knew about its biochemical pathway and the workings of T-cells, which is why you saw several companies taking a whack at it (Pfizer was in the area as well, and there are others whose preclinical programs you never even heard about). All in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a great big central problem of drug discovery for you: how do we go into the clinic (but avoid spending Phase III levels of money) to find these things out? Better yet, how do we avoid developing such things in the first place, if they’re going to do this to us? Billions of dollars, literal billions, are stacked up waiting for anyone who can start to begin to do such things. Just to pick on a recent hyped-up press release, could BenevolentAI’s “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/23/benevolentai-worth-two-billion&quot;&gt;machine brain&lt;/a&gt;” have warned people off? Would anyone have believed them if they had? (I doubt that very much, for both questions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the problem is that we’re doing things that no one has tried to do before, and we’re doing them on what is clearly incomplete information. And the only way to make it more complete is to. . .go ahead and do those things,apparently, and at great cost. Could you have warned everyone, in convincing fashion, not to chase IDO inhibitors? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/11/06/cb1_obesity_drugs_farewell_to_the_whole_lot&quot;&gt;CB1 antagonists&lt;/a&gt; for obesity?

Anti-amyloid &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/05/09/there-are-failures-you-know&quot;&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;? Mixed &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/07/11/the_last_ppar_compound&quot;&gt;PPAR ligands&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/27/hold-on-mercks-cetp-inhibitor-actually-works&quot;&gt;CETP&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors? &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2005/08/25/the_painful_history_of_substance_p&quot;&gt;Substance P&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors?

And I’m just picking ones off the top of my head that had multiple large research organizations working on them – there are plenty more where that came from, especially if you just bring in the targets that were disastrous for just one or two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these looked like worthwhile ideas at one point, and uncounted sums of money were spent on them (money from sales of other drugs to other customers and directly from investors). All of it could have been put to better use, but could you have done better? Sent people into areas that were less likely to fail, or found out that these mechanisms had something wrong with them without all the time, effort, and money? &lt;em&gt;Come on down and try it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><keywords><item>Cancer</item><item>Clinical Trials</item><item>Drug Industry History</item></keywords><title>IDO Appears to Have Wiped Out</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>We have the answer to a question posed here earlier this month.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and mutants have been associated with differences in clinical and virological characteristics. Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. Viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter this process to survive in host cells. In this work, we studied the modulation of autophagy by the replication of HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4, and the naturally occurring mutants BCP and preCore. HBV subgenotypes F1b and F4 replication induced accumulation of autophagosomes in hepatoma cells. However, no autophagic protein degradation was observed, indicating a blockage of autophagic flux at later stages. This inhibition of autophagy flux might be due to an impairment of lysosomal acidification in hepatoma cells. Moreover, HBV-mediated autophagy modulation was independent of the viral subgenotypes and enhanced in viruses with BCP and preCore naturally occurring mutations. These results contribute to understand the mechanisms by which different HBV variants contribute to the pathogenesis of HBV infections. In addition, this study is the first to describe the role that two highly prevalent naturally occurring mutations exert on the modulation of HBV-induced autophagy.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</originId><fingerprint>e13f6984</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197109</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by María Mercedes Elizalde, Paula Soledad Pérez, Ina Sevic, Daniel Grasso, Alejandro Ropolo, Luciana Barbini, Rodolfo Héctor Campos, María Inés Vaccaro, Diego Martín Flichman&lt;/p&gt;

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes. The index &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of chemical trees (chemical graphs representing alkanes) is defined as the number of unordered pairs of vertices (carbon atoms) at distance 3. The inverse problems based on some well-known topological indices have already been addressed in the literature. The solution of such inverse problems may be helpful in speeding up the discovery of lead compounds having the desired properties. This paper is devoted to solving a stronger version of the inverse problem based on Wiener polarity index for chemical trees. More precisely, it is proved that for every integer &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; ∈ {&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − 3, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − 2,…,3&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − 16, 3&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − 15}, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; ≥ 6, there exists an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-vertex chemical tree &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; such that &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) = &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197142</originId><fingerprint>f78c4b5a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197142</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zhibin Du, Akbar Ali&lt;/p&gt;

Thirty-eight percent of US adult women are obese, meaning that more children are now born of overweight and obese mothers, leading to an increase in predisposition to several adult onset diseases. To explore this phenomenon, we developed a maternal obesity animal model by feeding mice a diet composed of high fat/ high sugar (HF/HS) and assessed both maternal diet and offspring diet on the development of endometrial cancer (ECa). We show that maternal diet by itself did not lead to ECa initiation in wildtype offspring of the C57Bl/6J mouse strain. While offspring fed a HF/HS post-weaning diet resulted in poor metabolic health and decreased uterine weight (regardless of maternal diet), it did not lead to ECa. We also investigated the effects of the maternal obesogenic diet on ECa development in a Diethylstilbestrol (DES) carcinogenesis mouse model. All mice injected with DES had reproductive tract lesions including decreased number of glands, condensed and hyalinized endometrial stroma, and fibrosis and increased collagen deposition that in some mice extended into the myometrium resulting in extensive disruption and loss of the inner and outer muscular layers. Fifty percent of DES mice that were exposed to maternal HF/HS diet developed several features indicative of the initial stages of carcinogenesis including focal glandular and atypical endometrial hyperplasia versus 0% of their Chow counterparts. There was an increase in phospho-Akt expression in DES mice exposed to maternal HF/HS diet, a regulator of persistent proliferation in the endometrium, and no difference in total Akt, phospho-PTEN and total PTEN expression. In summary, maternal HF/HS diet exposure induces endometrial hyperplasia and other precancerous phenotypes in mice treated with DES. This study suggests that maternal obesity alone is not sufficient for the development of ECa, but has an additive effect in the presence of a secondary insult such as DES.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0186390</originId><fingerprint>bf0a9765</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0186390</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Theresa O.

PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (&gt;200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism.

PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (&gt;200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism.

Visual stimuli evoke activity in visual cortical neuronal populations. Neuronal activity can be selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined trial averaged tuning properties. However, given any single stimulus parameter, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in neuronal populations consisting of both tuned and untuned neurons. Specifically, we summarize pairwise covariability with an asymmetric partial correlation coefficient, allowing us to analyze the resultant population correlation structure, or functional network, with graph theory. Using the graph neighbors of a neuron, we find that the local population, including both tuned and untuned neurons, are able to predict individual neuron activity on a moment to moment basis, while also recapitulating tuning properties of tuned neurons. Variance explained in total population activity scales with the number of neurons imaged, demonstrating larger sample sizes are required to fully capture local network interactions. We also find that a specific functional triplet motif in the graph results in the best predictions, suggesting a signature of informative correlations in these populations. In summary, we show that unbiased sampling of the local population can explain single trial response variability as well as trial-averaged tuning properties in V1, and the ability to predict responses is tied to the occurrence of a functional triplet motif.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ovpobr3CnkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006153</link><crawled>1525455692279</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006153</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006153</originId><fingerprint>75ddd586</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Ovpobr3CnkQ/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joseph B.

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05). Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197367</originId><fingerprint>b94cb53c</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197367</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mireia Calvo, Daniel Romero, Virginie Le Rolle, Nathalie Béhar, Pedro Gomis, Philippe Mabo, Alfredo I.

Although exercise is effective in improving obesity and hyperinsulinemia, the exact influence of exercise on the capillary density of skeletal muscles remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of low-intensity exercise training on metabolism in obesity with hyperinsulinemia, focusing specifically on the capillary density within the skeletal muscle. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rats were used as animal models of obesity with hyperinsulinemia, whereas Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats served as controls (no obesity, no hyperinsulinemia). The animals were randomly assigned to either non-exercise or exercise groups (treadmill running for 60 min/day, for 4 weeks). The exercise groups were further divided into subgroups according to training mode: single bout (60 min, daily) vs. multiple bout (three bouts of 20 min, daily). Fasting insulin levels were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats. Among OLETF rats, there were no significant differences in fasting glucose levels between the exercise and the non-exercise groups, but the fasting insulin levels were significantly lower in the exercise group. Body weight and triacylglycerol levels in the liver were significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, these levels were significantly lower in the exercise than in the non-exercise group. The capillary-to-fiber ratio of the soleus muscle was significantly higher in OLETF than in LETO rats; however, among OLETF rats, the ratio was lower in the exercise group than in the non-exercise group. No significant differences in any of the studied parameters were noted between the single-bout and multiple-bout exercise training modes among either OLETF or LETO rats. These results suggest that low-intensity exercise training improves insulin sensitivity and fatty liver. Additionally, the fact that attenuation of excessive capillarization in the skeletal muscle of OLETF rats was accompanied by improvement in increased body weight.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196895</originId><fingerprint>74767617</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196895</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naoto Fujita, Saki Aono, Kohei Karasaki, Fumi Sera, Tomoyuki Kurose, Hidemi Fujino, Susumu Urakawa&lt;/p&gt;

Based on the results of structure-modeling studies of a mixed-anion system, we predicted novel derivatives of oxyhydrides – chiral hydroxyhydrides M2H3O(OH) (M = Y, Sc, La, and Gd) that are characterized by the coexistence of three anionic species, H–, O2 –, and OH– inside the crystal lattice.

Based on the results of structure-modeling studies of a mixed-anion system, we predicted novel derivatives of oxyhydrides – chiral hydroxyhydrides M2H3O(OH) (M = Y, Sc, La, and Gd) that are characterized by the coexistence of three anionic species, H–, O2 –, and OH– inside the crystal lattice. The materials demonstrate a speciﬁc charge ordering, which is connected with the chiral organization of atoms where both the metal cations and the anions are standing in positions that form helical curves spreading along the tetragonal axis. Moreover, the twisting of the H– and H+ sites gives rise to their linking via strong dihydrogen bonds.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR.

We developed a Bayesian model, called ALPHLARD, that collects reads potentially generated from HLA genes and accurately determines a pair of HLA types for each of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPA1, -DPB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, and -DRB1 genes at 6-digit resolution.

By comparing the results of HLA genotyping from SBT and amplicon sequencing methods, ALPHLARD achieved 98.8% for WES data and 98.5% for WGS data at 4-digit resolution. We also detected three somatic point mutations and one case of loss of heterozygosity in the HLA genes from the WGS data.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt; changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore. These results provided evidence that phytochromes mediated light signal transduction may play key roles in peanut geocarpy development.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198041</originId><fingerprint>a3927e5f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198041</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ye Zhang, Jinbo Sun, Han Xia, Chuanzhi Zhao, Lei Hou, Baoshan Wang, Aiqin Li, Min Chen, Shuzhen Zhao, Xingjun Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</link><crawled>1527098195054</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</originId><fingerprint>3268a71e</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0yJKQdlBIFk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yun Tao, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari&lt;/p&gt;

As the production of non-traditional export (NTX) crops by smallholder households in developing countries expands, there is a compelling need to understand the potential effects of this type of agricultural production on household food security and nutrition. We use two household surveys with a sample of 52 households, interviews, and focus groups to examine whether smallholder farmers who produce broccoli for export in a rural Guatemalan community have different household food security than farmers in the same community who are still growing traditional maize and bean crops. We explore and compare the food security status of broccoli farmers (adopters) and traditional farmers (non-adopters) across four dimensions of food security: availability, access, utilization, and stability. Adopters earned significantly more income (40%) than non-adopters, but higher incomes did not coincide with improvements in food availability, food access, or food utilization. Results indicate that adopters and non-adopters alike struggle with access to food, while the intensity of broccoli production may be undermining the ability of local agricultural systems to naturally control pests and regulate nutrients. More systematic approaches to food security assessment, especially those that consider all four dimensions of food security, are needed to better target interventions designed to alleviate food insecurity among rural smallholders.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198113</originId><fingerprint>2933ca69</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198113</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Josée Méthot, Elena M.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197936</originId><fingerprint>d9163893</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197936</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer L.

Nevertheless, the degree of conservation in regulatory mechanism is lower than that of expression, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Conservation and divergence in modules of the transcriptional programs of the human and mouse immune systems [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16387340ddd:6c087a0:93d646dc</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029375?af=R</link><author><name>Víctor M.

Group B &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GBS) carriage by pregnant women is the primary risk factor for early-onset GBS neonatal sepsis. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can prevent this transmission route, and two main approaches are recommended to base the selection of pregnant women to be submitted to IAP: the risk-based and the culture-based strategies. In Brazil, compliance to such recommendations is poor, and not much is known about GBS carriage. In the present study, 3,647 pregnant women living in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were screened for GBS anogenital colonization, over a period of 8 years (2008–2015). GBS was detected in 956 (26.2%) of them, and presence of vaginal discharge was the only trait associated with a higher risk for GBS colonization. Serotypes Ia (257; 37.3%) and II (137; 19.9%) were the most frequent among 689 (72.1% of the total) GBS isolates evaluated, followed by NT isolates (84; 12.1%), serotype Ib (77; 11.1%), V (63; 9.1%), III (47; 6.8%) and IV (24; 3.5%). Estimated coverage of major serotype-based GBS vaccines currently under clinical trials would vary from 65.2% to 84.3%. All 689 isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, levofloxacin, and tetracycline was observed in 5% (35), 2% (14), 14% (97), 5% (35) and 86% (592) of the isolates, respectively. No significant fluctuations in colonization rates, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were observed throughout the period of time investigated. The culture-based approach for IAP recommendation showed to be the best choice for the population investigated when compared to the risk-based, since the first did not increase the number of pregnant women submitted to antibiotic therapy and covered a larger number of women who were actually colonized by GBS. The fact the not all isolates were available for additional characterization, and serotype IX antiserum was not available for testing represent limitations of this study. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest investigation on GBS carriage among pregnant women in Brazil up to date, and results are useful for improving GBS prevention and treatment strategies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</originId><fingerprint>d648280d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196925</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Caroline N.

The rise of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) techniques have sparked an increasing interest in the effects of weak extracellular electric fields on neural activity. These fields modulate ongoing neural activity through polarization of the neuronal membrane. While the somatic polarization has been investigated experimentally, the frequency-dependent polarization of the dendritic trees in the presence of alternating (AC) fields has received little attention yet. Using a biophysically detailed model with experimentally constrained active conductances, we analyze the subthreshold response of cortical pyramidal cells to weak AC fields, as induced during tCS. We observe a strong frequency resonance around 10-20 Hz in the apical dendrites sensitivity to polarize in response to electric fields but not in the basal dendrites nor the soma. To disentangle the relative roles of the cell morphology and active and passive membrane properties in this resonance, we perform a thorough analysis using simplified models, e.g. a passive pyramidal neuron model, simple passive cables and reconstructed cell model with simplified ion channels. We attribute the origin of the resonance in the apical dendrites to (i) a locally increased sensitivity due to the morphology and to (ii) the high density of h-type channels. Our systematic study provides an improved understanding of the subthreshold response of cortical cells to weak electric fields and, importantly, allows for an improved design of tCS stimuli.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J_BWXr6Snsg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</link><crawled>1525455692279</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006124</originId><fingerprint>370fdb24</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/J_BWXr6Snsg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Florian Aspart, Michiel W.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA. Moreover, bone marrow adiposity is inversely associated with bone Volume and Turnover, which seems to be accentuated by the antiresorptive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197994</originId><fingerprint>a47a0c0b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197994</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mariel J.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</link><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006057</originId><fingerprint>34d1490d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/0tROk9h9FSA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Schmallenberg virus (SBV), initially identified in Germany in 2011, spread rapidly throughout Europe causing significant economic losses in ruminant livestock. The ability to correctly detect emerging and re-emerging diseases such as SBV with reliable tests is of high importance. Firstly, we tested diagnostic performance, specificity, and sensitivity of three different assays used in SBV antibody detection using control sheep samples of determined status. After obtaining the results from the control samples, we assessed the potential of the assays to detect previously infected animals in field situations. The samples were investigated using IDEXX Schmallenberg virus Antibody Test Kit, ID Screen Schmallenberg virus Competition Multi-species ELISA and Serum Neutralisation Test (SNT). Analysis of control samples revealed that SNT was the most suitable test, which was therefore used to calculate concordance and test performance for the two other ELISA tests. To evaluate whether different assay performances had an impact under field conditions, sheep samples from two different contexts were tested: the emergence of SBV in Ireland and the re-emergence of SBV in Belgium. Comparing the results obtained from different assays to the non-reference standard assay SNT, we showed considerable differences in estimates of their sensitivity to detect SBV antibodies and to measure seroprevalence of the sheep flocks. Finally, a calculation of the number of randomly selected animals that needs to be screened from a finite flock, showed that SNT and ID.Vet are the most suitable to detect an introduction of the disease in low seroprevalence situations. The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196532</originId><fingerprint>94a96869</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196532</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Srđan Pejaković, Laëtitia Wiggers, Damien Coupeau, Nathalie Kirschvink, James Mason, Benoît Muylkens&lt;/p&gt;

After obtaining the results from the control samples, we assessed the potential of the assays to detect previously infected animals in field situations. The samples were investigated using IDEXX Schmallenberg virus Antibody Test Kit, ID Screen Schmallenberg virus Competition Multi-species ELISA and Serum Neutralisation Test (SNT). Analysis of control samples revealed that SNT was the most suitable test, which was therefore used to calculate concordance and test performance for the two other ELISA tests. To evaluate whether different assay performances had an impact under field conditions, sheep samples from two different contexts were tested: the emergence of SBV in Ireland and the re-emergence of SBV in Belgium. Comparing the results obtained from different assays to the non-reference standard assay SNT, we showed considerable differences in estimates of their sensitivity to detect SBV antibodies and to measure seroprevalence of the sheep flocks. Finally, a calculation of the number of randomly selected animals that needs to be screened from a finite flock, showed that SNT and ID.Vet are the most suitable to detect an introduction of the disease in low seroprevalence situations. The IDEXX ELISA test was only able to detect SBV antibodies in a higher seroprevalence context, which is not optimal for monitoring freedom of disease and surveillance studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Test selection for antibody detection according to the seroprevalence level of Schmallenberg virus in sheep</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1524862800000</updated></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef67:3dd877af</id><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5323.short?rss=1</link><author><name>Allison C.

Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of indigestible carbohydrates that are fermented by microbiota in the hindgut. This study was designed to investigate the effects of oral SCFAs administration on the lipid metabolism of weaned pigs. A total of 21 barrows were randomly allocated into three groups, including control group (orally infused with 200 mL physiological saline per day), low dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 20.04 mM, propionic acid 7.71 mM and butyric acid 4.89 mM per day), and high dose SCFAs group (orally infused with 200 mL SCFAs containing acetic acid 40.08 mM, propionic acid 15.42 mM and butyric acid 9.78 mM per day). The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196867</originId><fingerprint>4a7986b3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196867</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by A.

The results showed that the average daily feed intake of SCFAs groups were lower than that of control group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Oral administration of SCFAs decreased the concentrations of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and insulin (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased the leptin concentration in serum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). The total fat, as well as TC and TG levels in liver, was decreased by oral SCFAs administration (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In addition, SCFAs down-regulated the mRNA expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and enhanced the mRNA expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α) in liver (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). SCFAs also decreased FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor σ mRNA expressions in longissimus dorsi (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). And in abdominal fat, SCFAs reduced FAS and ACC mRNA expressions (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and increased CPT-1α mRNA expression (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). These results suggested that oral administration of SCFAs could attenuate fat deposition in weaned pigs via reducing lipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis of different tissues.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Oral administration of short chain fatty acids could attenuate fat deposition of pigs</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525381200000</updated></item><item><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_16364a1d1ff:13beff:d63e3ae2</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444</link><author><name>Lulu Fan, Bingchen Zhang, Aixiao Xu, Zhichun Shen, Yan Guo, Ruirui Zhao, Huilu Yao, Jing-Wei Shao</name></author><published>1526356800000</published><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444/20180515/images/medium/mp-2018-004448_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</originId><fingerprint>d9a2aea0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luisa Marenzoni, Lorenzo Santoni, Andrea Felici, Carmen Maresca, Valentina Stefanetti, Monica Sforna, Maria Pia Franciosini, Patrizia Casagrande Proietti, Francesco Carlo Origgi&lt;/p&gt;

The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression.

Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and patient-level genetic assessments can guide therapy choice and impact prognosis. However, little is known about the impact of genetic variability within a tumor, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), on disease progression or outcome. Current approaches using bulk tumor specimens can suggest the presence of ITH, but only single-cell genetic methods have the resolution to describe the underlying clonal structures themselves. Current techniques tend to be labor and resource intensive and challenging to characterize with respect to sources of biological and technical variability. We have developed a platform using a microfluidic self-digitization chip to partition cells in stationary volumes for cell imaging and allele-specific PCR. Genotyping data from only confirmed single-cell volumes is obtained and subject to a variety of relevant quality control assessments such as allele dropout, false positive, and false negative rates. We demonstrate single-cell genotyping of the &lt;i&gt;NPM1&lt;/i&gt; type A mutation, an important prognostic indicator in acute myeloid leukemia, on single cells of the cell line OCI-AML3, describing a more complex zygosity distribution than would be predicted via bulk analysis.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</originId><fingerprint>2fd88f31</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196801</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alison M.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to in silico examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of target genes. Results: We initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. A Decision Tree classifier exhibited the largest area (0.9987 and 0.9956 respectively before and after eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DNase I HyperSensitive Regions (DHSs)) under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting such coordinately regulated genes. Target gene prediction was confirmed using siRNA knockdown data of TFs, which was more accurate than CRISPR inactivation. In-silico mutation analyses of TFBSs also revealed that one or more information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters are required for accurate target gene prediction. Conclusions: Machine learning based on TFBS information density, organization, and chromatin accessibility accurately identifies gene targets with comparable tissue-wide expression patterns. Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283267v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>d8bd3590</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/283267v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: The distribution and composition of cis-regulatory modules (e.g. transcription factor binding site (TFBS) clusters) in promoters substantially determine gene expression patterns and TF targets, whose expression levels are significantly regulated by TF binding.

Multiple, information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters appear to protect promoters from the effects of deleterious binding site mutations in a single TFBS that would effectively alter the expression state of these genes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Information-dense transcription factor binding site clusters identify target genes with similar tissue-wide expression profiles and serve as a buffer against mutations [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1632514a543:b2a08a:5785ab88</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25251-9</link><author><name>Kavita Bhalla</name></author><published>1525330800000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25251-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25251-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-NXa3gCEVR0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525335500099</crawled><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25251-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25251-9</originId><fingerprint>1b21391d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/-NXa3gCEVR0/s41598-018-25251-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25251-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25251-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/-NXa3gCEVR0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Author Correction: Role of hypoxia in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma: Metabolic repression and selective translation of HK2 facilitates development of DLBCL</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163933f978b:800becf:93d646dc</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328914v1?rss=1</link><author><name>Kaur, N.</name></author><published>1527145200000</published><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>Background: Virtual crossmatch utilizes HLA typing and antibody screen assay data as a part of organ offers in deceased donor allocation systems.

While previous work has shown that the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification is a useful, though subjective, feature for predicting surgical outcomes, obtaining this classification requires a clinician to review the patient&apos;s medical records. Our goal here is to create an improved risk score using electronic medical records and demonstrate its utility in predicting in-hospital mortality without requiring clinician-derived ASA scores. Methods: Data from 49,513 surgical patients were used to train logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree classifiers for predicting in-hospital mortality. The features used are readily available before surgery from EMR databases. A gradient boosted tree regression model was trained to impute the ASA Physical Status Classification, and this new, imputed score was included as an additional feature to preoperatively predict in-hospital post-surgical mortality. The preoperative risk prediction was then used as an input feature to a deep neural network (DNN), along with intraoperative features, to predict postoperative in-hospital mortality risk. Performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: We found that the random forest classifier (AUC 0.921, 95%CI 0.908-0.934) outperforms logistic regression (AUC 0.871, 95%CI 0.841-0.900) and gradient boosted trees (AUC 0.897, 95%CI 0.881-0.912) in predicting in-hospital post-surgical mortality. Using logistic regression, the ASA Physical Status Classification score alone had an AUC of 0.865 (95%CI 0.848-0.882). Adding preoperative features to the ASA Physical Status Classification improved the random forest AUC to 0.929 (95%CI 0.915-0.943). Using only automatically obtained preoperative features with no clinician intervention, we found that the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.921 (95%CI 0.908-0.934). Integrating the preoperative risk prediction into the DNN for postoperative risk prediction results in an AUC of 0.924 (95%CI 0.905-0.941), and with both a preoperative and postoperative risk score for each patient, we were able to show that the mortality risk changes over time. Conclusions: Features easily extracted from EMR data can be used to preoperatively predict the risk of in-hospital post-surgical mortality in a fully automated fashion, with accuracy comparable to models trained on features that require clinical expertise. This preoperative risk score can then be compared to the postoperative risk score to show that the risk changes, and therefore should be monitored longitudinally over time.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>3cf7560f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329813v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Background: Predicting preoperative in-hospital mortality using readily-available electronic medical record (EMR) data can aid clinicians in accurately and rapidly determining surgical risk.

Here we present and benchmark a novel tensorial independent component analysis (tICA) algorithm against current state-of-the-art methods. Using simulated and real multi-omic data, we find that tICA outperforms established methods in identifying biological sources of data variation at a significantly reduced computational cost. Using two independent multi cell-type EWAS, we further demonstrate how tICA can identify, in the absence of genotype information, mQTLs at a higher sensitivity than competing multi-way algorithms. We validate mQTLs found with tICA in an independent set, and demonstrate that approximately 75$\%$ of mQTLs are independent of blood cell subtype. In an application to multi-omic cancer data, tICA identifies many gene modules whose expression variation across tumors is driven by copy number or DNA methylation changes, but whose deregulation relative to the normal state is independent such alterations, an important finding that we confirm by direct analysis of individual data types. In summary, tICA is a powerful novel algorithm for decomposing multi-omic data, which will be of great value to the research community.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>cc41ee39</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/300277v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>There is an increased need for integrative analyses of multi-omic data.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution. These findings add to our knowledge of the health economics and indicate future research about healthcare of cardiac arrest survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</originId><fingerprint>dbd1ac1f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196687</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yi-Ming Weng, Chip-Jin Ng, Chen-June Seak, Cheng-Yu Chien, Kuan-Fu Chen, Jr-Rung Lin, Chee-Jen Chang&lt;/p&gt;

Elevated temperature induces the heat shock (HS) response, which modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune and inflammatory responses. However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</link><crawled>1525110005493</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006130</originId><fingerprint>483a53b9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/SmfXbHv2meA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Małgorzata Kardyńska, Anna Paszek, Jarosław Śmieja, David Spiller, Wiesława Widłak, Michael R.

In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Quantitative analysis reveals crosstalk mechanisms of heat shock-induced attenuation of NF-κB signaling at the single cell level</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525122000000</updated></item><item><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1632553339e:b99a6a:5785ab88</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04179-8</link><author><name>Sang Cheul Oh</name></author><published>1525330800000</published><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clinical and genomic landscape of gastric cancer with a mesenchymal phenotype&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and genomic landscape of gastric cancer with a mesenchymal phenotype, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04179-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04179-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The prognosis and treatment of gastric cancer is complicated by heterogeneity.

Microorganisms respond to a variety of metabolic perturbations by repurposing or recruiting pathways to reroute metabolic flux and overcome the perturbation. Elimination of the 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, PanE, both reduces total coenzyme A (CoA) levels and causes a conditional HMP-P auxotrophy in &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;. CoA or acetyl-CoA has no demonstrable effect on the HMP-P synthase, ThiC, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Suppressors aimed at probing the connection between the biosynthesis of thiamine and CoA contained mutations in the gene encoding the &lt;i&gt;ilvC&lt;/i&gt; transcriptional regulator, &lt;i&gt;ilvY&lt;/i&gt;. These mutations may help inform the structure and mechanism of action for the effector-binding domain, as they represent the first sequenced substitutions in the effector-binding domain of IlvY that cause constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;ilvC&lt;/i&gt;. Since IlvC moonlights as a 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, the resultant increase in &lt;i&gt;ilvC&lt;/i&gt; transcription increased synthesis of CoA. This study failed to identify mutations overcoming the need for CoA for thiamine synthesis in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterica panE&lt;/i&gt; mutants, suggesting that a more integrated approach may be necessary to uncover the mechanism connecting CoA and ThiC activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</originId><fingerprint>715ae8d9</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dustin C.

Localized maternal mRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. the establishment of embryonic axes and the developmental cell fate specification, in various animal species. In ascidians, a group of maternal mRNAs, called &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, is localized to a subcellular structure, called the Centrosome-Attracting Body (CAB), which contains the ascidian germ plasm, and is inherited by the germline cells during embryogenesis. Posterior end mark (Pem), a &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs member, represses somatic gene expression in the germline during cleavage stages by inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity.

Localized maternal mRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis, e.g. the establishment of embryonic axes and the developmental cell fate specification, in various animal species. In ascidians, a group of maternal mRNAs, called &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, is localized to a subcellular structure, called the Centrosome-Attracting Body (CAB), which contains the ascidian germ plasm, and is inherited by the germline cells during embryogenesis. Posterior end mark (Pem), a &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs member, represses somatic gene expression in the germline during cleavage stages by inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity. However, the functions of other &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/ PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs members in germline formation are largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the functions of two &lt;i&gt;postplasmic/PEM&lt;/i&gt; RNAs, &lt;i&gt;Popk-1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zf-1&lt;/i&gt;, in transcriptional regulation in the germline cells.

Methods and Findings: We derived prognosis prediction models for EVD using data from 470 patients admitted to five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) operated by International Medical Corps (IMC) in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We fitted logistic regression models, handled missing data by multiple imputation, and conducted internal validation with bootstrap sampling. We also validated our models with independent datasets from two treatment centers in Sierra Leone comprising 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital and 158 patients at the GOAL-Mathaska ETU in Port Loko district. We corroborated earlier reports on the importance of viral load and age as mortality predictors and identified jaundice and bleeding to be features with highest predictive value at presentation. Additional clinical symptoms at presentation, although individually weakly correlated with outcome, help broaden sensitivity and refine discrimination of the models. The app provides a visual representation of the predictive outcome as well as attributing clinical protocols adjusted by demographic parameters and prioritized to target the largest contributing factor to overall risk. The app is freely available under the name of Ebola RISK on Google Play and Apple&apos;s App Store. Conclusions: We derived and validated high performance models of EVD prognosis prediction from the largest and most geographically diverse EVD patients available to date. The performance was maintained during external validations on two independent datasets representing different treatment settings and mortality rates, which suggests that the models could be generalized to new populations. These models and derived tools may better inform treatment choices in future EVD outbreaks.

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM.

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM. The corresponding DIM-PADM-based DAO problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm.The proposed algorithm was validated through application to TG119, prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) cases from the common optimization for radiation therapy dataset. Compared with the two-step FMO–LSA procedure, the proposed algorithm resulted in more precise dose conformality in all four cases.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</originId><fingerprint>239aec5f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</originId><fingerprint>d7dac92a</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197286</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

Many methods have been developed to select a subset of variant loci, which are associated with or predictive of the phenotype. Selecting connected SNPs on SNP-SNP networks have been proven successful in finding biologically interpretable and predictive SNPs. However, we argue that the connectedness constraint favors selecting redundant features that affect similar biological processes and therefore does not necessarily yield better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SPADIS that favors the selection of remotely located SNPs in order to account for their complementary effects in explaining a phenotype. This is achieved by maximizing a submodular set function with a greedy algorithm that ensures a constant factor approximation to the optimal solution. We compare SPADIS to the state-of-the-art method SConES, on a dataset of Arabidopsis Thaliana with continuous flowering time phenotypes. SPADIS has better average phenotype prediction performance in 15 out of 17 phenotypes when the same number of SNPs are selected and provides consistent improvements across multiple networks and settings on average. Moreover, it identifies more candidate genes and runs faster. We also investigate the use of Hi-C data to construct SNP-SNP network in the context of SNP selection problem for the first time, which yields improvements in regression performance across all methods.

In this paper, an adaptive fractional order sliding mode control (AFSMC) scheme is designed for the current tracking control of the Boost-type converter in a Battery/Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). In order to stabilize the current, the adaptation rules based on state-observer and Lyapunov function are being designed. A fractional order sliding surface function is defined based on the tracking current error and adaptive rules. Furthermore, through fractional order analysis, the stability of the fractional order control system is proven, and the value of the fractional order (λ) is being investigated. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMC strategy is being verified by numerical simulations. The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainty are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196501</originId><fingerprint>27b43ce4</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196501</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianlin Wang, Dan Xu, Huan Zhou, Tao Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainty are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Adaptive fractional order sliding mode control for Boost converter in the Battery/Supercapacitor HESS</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1524862800000</updated></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16325493de1:b8a36a:5785ab88</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25477-7</link><author><name>Ifeoluwa Shoyombo</name></author><published>1525330800000</published><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><engagement>21</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25477-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25477-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/eNofPNdpNTI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><crawled>1525338947041</crawled><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25477-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25477-7</originId><fingerprint>ad60e7d8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/eNofPNdpNTI/s41598-018-25477-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values, Published online: 03 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25477-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25477-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/eNofPNdpNTI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Understanding the Relationship Between the Neurologic Pupil Index and Constriction Velocity Values</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163423d8ac9:6f0f7f:2835af05</id><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35272</link><author><name>jrandall@nmsu.edu (Craig E Kallsen)</name></author><published>1525737600000</published><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35272</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525824719561</crawled><description>We would like to address a number of concerns regarding this paper (Savory et al., 2017)</description><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35272</originId><fingerprint>a2a80bb0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35272</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Plant Biology</item></keywords><title>Comment on “Evolutionary transitions between beneficial and phytopathogenic Rhodococcus challenge disease management”</title><summary><content>We would like to address a number of concerns regarding this paper (Savory et al., 2017)</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee8:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</link><author><name>Paul G.

Repositioning of the maxilla in orthognathic surgery is carried out for functional and aesthetic purposes. Pre-surgical planning tools can predict 3D facial appearance by computing the response of the soft tissue to the changes to the underlying skeleton. The clinical use of commercial prediction software remains controversial, likely due to the deterministic nature of these computational predictions. A novel probabilistic finite element model (FEM) for the prediction of postoperative facial soft tissues is proposed in this paper. A probabilistic FEM was developed and validated on a cohort of eight patients who underwent maxillary repositioning and had pre- and postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans taken. Firstly, a variables correlation assessed various modelling parameters. Secondly, a design of experiments (DOE) provided a range of potential outcomes based on uniformly distributed input parameters, followed by an optimisation. Lastly, the second DOE iteration provided optimised predictions with a probability range. A range of 3D predictions was obtained using the probabilistic FEM and validated using reconstructed soft tissue surfaces from the postoperative CBCT data. The predictions in the nose and upper lip areas accurately include the true postoperative position, whereas the prediction under-estimates the position of the cheeks and lower lip. A probabilistic FEM has been developed and validated for the prediction of the facial appearance following orthognathic surgery. This method shows how inaccuracies in the modelling and uncertainties in executing surgical planning influence the soft tissue prediction and it provides a range of predictions including a minimum and maximum, which may be helpful for patients in understanding the impact of surgery on the face.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</originId><fingerprint>bf09ec4d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197209</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Paul G.

State-of-the-art yeast genetic interaction mapping, which relies on robotic manipulation of arrays of double mutant strains, does not scale readily to multi-condition studies. Here we describe Barcode Fusion Genetics to map Genetic Interactions (BFG-GI), by which double mutant strains generated via en masse party mating can also be monitored en masse for growth and genetic interactions. By using site-specific recombination to fuse two DNA barcodes, each representing a specific gene deletion, BFG-GI enables multiplexed quantitative tracking of double mutants via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-GI to a matrix of DNA repair genes under nine different conditions, including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), bleomycin, zeocin, and three other DNA-damaging environments. BFG-GI recapitulated known genetic interactions and yielded new condition-dependent genetic interactions. We validated and further explored a subnetwork of condition-dependent genetic interactions involving MAG1, SLX4, and genes encoding the Shu complex, and inferred that loss of the Shu complex leads to a decrease in the activation or activity of the checkpoint protein kinase Rad53.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181750v2?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>6a7419c1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/181750v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Condition-dependent genetic interactions can reveal functional relationships between genes that are not evident under standard culture conditions.

By using site-specific recombination to fuse two DNA barcodes, each representing a specific gene deletion, BFG-GI enables multiplexed quantitative tracking of double mutants via next-generation sequencing. We applied BFG-GI to a matrix of DNA repair genes under nine different conditions, including methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), bleomycin, zeocin, and three other DNA-damaging environments. BFG-GI recapitulated known genetic interactions and yielded new condition-dependent genetic interactions. We validated and further explored a subnetwork of condition-dependent genetic interactions involving MAG1, SLX4, and genes encoding the Shu complex, and inferred that loss of the Shu complex leads to a decrease in the activation or activity of the checkpoint protein kinase Rad53.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Mapping DNA damage-dependent genetic interactions in yeast via party mating and barcode fusion genetics [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f1e1e3e:1467e8:3dd877af</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25243-9</link><author><name>Maizlinda I.

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197781</originId><fingerprint>3794c83f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197781</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna C.

Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Profiling neurotransmitters in a crustacean neural circuit for locomotion</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527022800000</updated></item><item><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16387340ddd:6c0879e:93d646dc</id><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023508?af=R</link><author><name>Kin Long Kelvin Lee</name></author><published>1526874178000</published><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><crawled>1526981725661</crawled><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023508?af=R</originId><fingerprint>9599adfc</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5023508?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/19&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 19&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Zero-point energy conservation in classical trajectory simulations: Application to H2CO</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 19, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f72:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197070</link><author><name>In Kyung Park</name></author><published>1526072400000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197070</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by In Kyung Park, Jeong-Sik Yu, Eun-Suk Cho, Joo Hee Kim, Jae-Joon Chung&lt;/p&gt;

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A positive association between nutritional risk and the incidence of surgical site infections: A hospital-based register study</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8c:ed160cc3</id><recrawled>1524850922255</recrawled><author><name>Jared Adolf-Bryfogle</name></author><published>1524862800000</published><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><engagement>83</engagement><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</link><crawled>1524850819362</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006112</originId><fingerprint>ead87314</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PVAny09_uEE/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

Around 70% of circulating alpha-2-antiplasmin (α2AP), the main natural plasmin inhibitor, is N-terminally cleaved between residues Pro12 and Asn13 by antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme. This converts native Met-α2AP into the more potent fibrinolysis inhibitor Asn-α2AP. The Arg6Trp (R6W) polymorphism affects the N-terminal cleavage rate of Met-α2AP in a purified system, with ~8-fold faster conversion of Met(R6)-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP. To date, assays to determine N-terminally intact Met-α2AP in plasma have been limited to an ELISA that only measures Met(R6)-α2AP. The aim of this study was to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and all α2AP forms (total-α2AP) in order to develop specific Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP ELISAs. Recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP, Met(W6)-α2AP and Asn-α2AP were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Using hybridoma technology, a panel of 25 mAbs was generated against a mixture of recombinant Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP. All mAbs were evaluated for their specific reactivity using the three recombinant α2APs in one-site non-competitive ELISAs. Three mAbs were selected to develop sandwich-type ELISAs. MA-AP37E2 and MA-AP34C4 were selected for their specific reactivity against Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, and used for coating. MA-AP15D7 was selected for its reactivity against total-α2AP and used for detection. With the novel ELISAs we determined Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP levels in plasma samples and we showed that Met(R6)-α2AP was converted faster into Asn-α2AP than Met(W6)-α2AP in a plasma milieu. In conclusion, we developed two specific ELISAs for Met(R6)-α2AP and Met(W6)-α2AP, respectively, in plasma. This will enable us to determine N-terminal heterogeneity of α2AP in plasma samples.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</originId><fingerprint>e8049f69</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196911</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shiraazkhan Abdul, Miet Peeters, Els Brouwers, Joyce J.

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</originId><fingerprint>8e92d384</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jukka M.

We study the landscape of solutions for each single-cell Hi-C dataset as a function of prior strength and demonstrate clustering of solutions using data from the same cell.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Bayesian Estimation of 3D Chromosomal Structure from Single Cell Hi-C Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>True</unread></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f83:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</link><author><name>Bárbara Alemar</name></author><published>1526072400000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bárbara Alemar, Cleandra Gregório, Josef Herzog, Camila Matzenbacher Bittar, Cristina Brinckmann Oliveira Netto, Osvaldo Artigalas, Ida Vanessa D.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007).

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group.

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</originId><fingerprint>ebe29cd1</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sruti S.

Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5)&lt;/i&gt; gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y and +/Y mice. &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context.

Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5)&lt;/i&gt; gene cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Recently we have generated &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice by targeting exon 2 on the C57BL/6N background, and demonstrated postsynaptic overaccumulation of GluN2B-containing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus. In the current study, we subjected the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; KO mice to a battery of comprehensive behavioral tests, aiming to reveal the effects of loss of CDKL5 in a whole perspective of motor, emotional, social, and cognition/memory functions, and to identify its undetermined roles. The neurological screen, rotarod, hot plate, prepulse inhibition, light/dark transition, open field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, one-chamber and three-chamber social interaction, 24-h home cage monitoring, contextual and cued fear conditioning, Barnes maze, and T-maze tests were applied on adult &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y and +/Y mice. &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a mild alteration in the gait. Analyses of emotional behaviors revealed significantly enhanced anxiety-like behaviors of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. Depressive-like behaviors and social interaction of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were uniquely altered. The contextual and cued fear conditioning of &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice were comparable to control mice; however, &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice showed a significantly increased freezing time and a significantly decreased distance traveled during the pretone period in the altered context. Both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory were significantly impaired. The morphometric analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed impaired dendritic arborization and immature spine development in &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;/i&gt; -/Y mice. These results indicate that CDKL5 plays significant roles in regulating emotional behaviors especially on anxiety- and fear-related responses, and in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory, which suggests that focus and special attention should be paid to the specific mechanisms of these deficits in the CDKL5 deficiency disorder.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Comprehensive behavioral analysis of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&amp;lt;/i&gt; knockout mice revealed significant enhancement in anxiety- and fear-related behaviors and impairment in both acquisition and long-term retention of spatial reference memory</title><unread>False</unread><updated>1524862800000</updated></item><item><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_163935c6690:6994f:d63e3ae2</id><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00271</link><author><name>Spundana Malla, Karteek Kadimisetty, Di Jiang, Dharamainder Choudhary, James F.

The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis.

The Morris water maze test (MWM) is a useful tool to evaluate rodents’ spatial learning and memory, but the outcome is susceptible to various experimental conditions. Thigmotaxis is a commonly observed behavioral pattern which is thought to be related to anxiety or fear. This behavior is associated with prolonged escape latency, but the impact of its frequency in the early stage on the final outcome is not clearly understood. We analyzed swim path trajectories in male C57BL/6 mice with or without bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) treatment. There was no significant difference in the frequencies of particular types of trajectories according to ischemic brain surgery. The mouse groups with thigmotaxis showed significantly prolonged escape latency and lower cognitive score on day 5 compared to those without thigmotaxis. As the next step, we made a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to recognize the swim path trajectories. Our model could distinguish thigmotaxis from other trajectories with 96% accuracy and specificity as high as 0.98. These results suggest that thigmotaxis in the early training stage is a predictive factor for impaired performance in MWM, and machine learning can detect such behavior easily and automatically.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Recognition of early stage thigmotaxis in Morris water maze test with convolutional neural network</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525381200000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c5:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197626</link><author><name>Satoko Kosaka</name></author><published>1526504400000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197626</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Satoko Kosaka, Kazuhiro Suda, Budhi Gunawan, Ardini Raksanagara, Chiho Watanabe, Masahiro Umezaki&lt;/p&gt;

While the pattern of cell division has specific rules for healthy development, some fluctuations for this pattern are allowable. In order to uncover this robust mechanism of development, the position of cells in each embryo must be analyzed quantitatively. In the embryonic developmental biology, various studies are attempted to acquire the quantitative criteria from time-series three-dimensional microscopic images by image analysis such as segmentation, to understand the mechanism of development. Unfortunately, due to the fact of inaccuracy of nuclei detection and segmentation, it is a hard task to evaluate an embryo quantitatively from bioimages automatically. Based on these demands of quantitative analysis, we developed QCA Net, which accurately performs nuclear segmentation of three-dimensional fluorescence microscopic images for early-stage mouse embryos. QCA Net is based on Convolutional Neural Network. We trained QCA Net using a part of one early-stage mouse embryo. As a test, QCA Net performed segmentation of different 11 mouse embryos images. We succeeded in accurately acquiring the shape of the nucleus without fusion of nuclear regions. Besides, we achieved accurate extraction of the time-series data of nuclear number, volume, surface area, and center of gravity coordinates as the quantitative criteria of mouse development, from the segmentation images acquired by QCA Net. To our surprise, these results suggested that QCA Net recognized and distinguished the nucleus and a polar body formed in meiosis process. We consider that QCA Net can drastically contribute to performing segmentation of various bioimages in the embryonic developmental biology. The various quantitative criteria obtained from segmented images can uncover various unknown mechanisms of embryonic development, such as the robust mechanism of development.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>e722e9b3</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Multicellular organisms develop from the fertilized eggs through numbers of cell divisions.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</originId><fingerprint>c17a217f</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits.

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</originId><fingerprint>d6e71953</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

‐phosphate (PLP) Schiff Bases, namely the internal and external aldimines, at the active site of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) enzyme in aqueous medium. It is important to determine the relative stability of the two tautomers (ketoenamine and enolimine) of the PLP aldimines to study the catalytic activity of the concerned enzyme. Both the internal PLP aldimine (PLP‐LYS) and the external PLP aldimine (PLP‐SER) of SHMT are found to have a higher stability for the ketoenamine tautomer over the enolimine form. The higher stability of the ketoenamine tautomer can be attributed to the more number of favorable interactions of the ketoenamine form with its surroundings at the active site of the enzyme. The ketoenamine is found to be stabilized by about 2.5 kcal/mol in the PLP‐LYS internal aldimine, while this stabilization is about 6.7 kcal/mol for the PLP‐SER external aldimine at the active site of the enzyme compared to the corresponding enolimine forms. The interactions faced by the PLP aldimines at the active site pocket determine the relative dominance of the tautomers and could possibly alter the tautomeric shift in different PLP dependent enzymes. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25338?af=R</originId><fingerprint>30719903</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25338?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Free energy landscapes of prototropic tautomerism in pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate schiff bases at the active site of an enzyme in aqueous medium</title><unread>True</unread><summary><content>We have performed hybrid quantum‐classical metadynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations to investigate the free energy landscapes of intramolecular proton transfer and associated tautomeric equilibrium in pyridoxal 5

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</link><crawled>1526493856788</crawled><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</originId><fingerprint>ee3c4299</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/jN05gwz7zUk/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

This raises the question - how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and their impact on force dynamics? Here we employed finite element modelling of cardiac bioenergetics, using computational meshes derived from electron microscope images, to address this question. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine (Cr) and creatine phosphate (PCr). However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase (CK) system, coupled with rapid diffusion of Cr and PCr, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross sections. This homogenous distribution of ATP and ADP should also evenly distribute force production and twitch duration with contraction. These results suggest that the PCr shuttle, and associated enzymatic reactions, act to maintain uniform force dynamics in the cell despite the heterogeneous mitochondrial organization. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia - activity of mitochondrial CK enzyme and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation.</description><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327254v1?rss=1</originId><fingerprint>c4f25684</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327254v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>Recent electron microscopy data have revealed that cardiac mitochondria are not arranged in crystalline columns, but are organised with several mitochondria aggregated into columns of varying sizes often spanning the cell cross-section.

Pesticides are one of the most widely used pest and disease control measures in plant crops and their indiscriminate use poses a direct risk to the health of populations and environment around the world. As a result, there is a great need for the development of new, less toxic molecules to be employed against plant pathogens. In this work, we employed an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;), tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) and corn (&lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets. By combining sequence and structural data, we obtained an initial set of 568 cases of analogy, of which 97 were validated and further refined, revealing a subset of 29 essential enzymatic activities with a total of 119 different structural forms, most belonging to central metabolic routes, including the carbohydrate metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids, among others. Further, another subset of 26 enzymatic activities possess a tertiary structure specific for the pathogen, not present in plants, men and &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, which may be of importance for the development of specific enzymatic inhibitors against plant diseases that are less harmful to humans and the environment.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197511</originId><fingerprint>5de8718d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197511</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangeline Azevedo da Silva, Leandro de Mattos Pereira, Melise Chaves Silveira, Rodrigo Jardim, Antonio Basilio de Miranda&lt;/p&gt;

In this work, we employed an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;), tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) and corn (&lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets. By combining sequence and structural data, we obtained an initial set of 568 cases of analogy, of which 97 were validated and further refined, revealing a subset of 29 essential enzymatic activities with a total of 119 different structural forms, most belonging to central metabolic routes, including the carbohydrate metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids, among others. Further, another subset of 26 enzymatic activities possess a tertiary structure specific for the pathogen, not present in plants, men and &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, which may be of importance for the development of specific enzymatic inhibitors against plant diseases that are less harmful to humans and the environment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Mining of potential drug targets through the identification of essential and analogous enzymes in the genomes of pathogens of &amp;lt;i&gt;Glycine max&amp;lt;/i&gt;, &amp;lt;i&gt;Zea mays&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1527282000000</updated></item><item><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47dba:93d646dc</id><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaao4650?rss=1</link><author><name>Seltmann, K., Meyer, M., Sulcova, J., Kockmann, T., Wehkamp, U., Weidinger, S., auf dem Keller, U., Werner, S.</name></author><published>1525888246000</published><origin><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/440/eaao4650.full</canonicalUrl><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;Low environmental humidity aggravates symptoms of the inflammatory skin disease atopic dermatitis (AD).

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield.

Background &lt;p&gt;Insect wax is a famous biological resource for the role in economic production in China. Insect wax is a good source of policosanol, which may is a candidate supplement in foodstuff and pharmaceuticals that has important physiological activities. Therefore, this work aims to investigate a high-yield and rapid method for policosanol fabrication from insect wax.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The conditions for policosanol fabrication were optimized as follows: an oil bath temperature of 112.7°C and reductant dosage of 0.97 g (used for the reduction of 10.00 g of insect wax). The yield of policosanol reached 83.20%, which was 4 times greater than that of existing methods, such as saponification. The total content of policosanol obtained under the optimal conditions reached 87%. In other words, a high yield of policosanol was obtained from insect wax (723.84 mg/g), that was 55 times higher than that generated from beeswax-brown via saponification. The concentrations of metal residues in policosanol were within the limits of the European Union regulations and EFSA stipulation. The LD50 values for oral doses of insect wax and policosanol were both &gt; 5 g/kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Policosanol was fabricated via solvent-free reduction from insect wax using LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at a high yield. The fabrication conditions were optimized. Policosanol and insect wax showed high security, which made them potential candidates as supplements in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. The rapid and high-yield method has great potential for commercial manufacturing of policosanol.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Policosanol fabrication from insect wax and optimization by response surface methodology</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526418000000</updated></item><item><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16341385bca:5412ed:93d646dc</id><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/5016.short?rss=1</link><author><name>Olga S.

Despite the rapid worldwide expansion of parks with outdoor fitness equipment (OFE), no objective data regarding the intensity of activity associated with using OFE are available. Hence, this study quantified the energy expenditure and intensity of physical activity by examining four outdoor fitness devices widely used by older adults and provides objective evidence-based intensity references for the Compendium of Physical Activities. Sixteen older adults (mean age: 70.7 ± 5.6 yr) equipped with a portable metabolic system for measuring energy expenditure and activity intensity completed tasks while walking or using four types of OFE. Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were employed. The energy expenditure and activity intensity for using an air walker at tempos of 80, 100, and 120 bpm were 50.78 ± 14.76 (2.81 ± 0.85), 59.62 ± 14.23 (3.26 ± 0.82), and 65.62 ± 18.27 (3.55 ± 1.02) cal/kg/min (METs), respectively. The induced energy and intensity output values for a ski machine were 54.00 ± 14.31 (3.02 ± 0.87), 68.87 ± 22.74 (3.82 ± 1.35), and 74.55 ± 23.39 (4.05 ± 1.35) cal/kg/min (METs), at 80, 100, and 120 bpm, respectively. The energy output for a waist twister at 60 bpm was 38.43 ± 20.16 cal/kg/min (2.05 ± 1.15 METs), and that for a double arm stretch at 80 bpm was 31.05 ± 12.58 cal/kg/min (1.63 ± 0.70 METs). These findings indicate that activity on the ski machine and air walker could be considered to have moderate intensity, whereas the intensity of activity on the waist twister and double arm stretch was significantly lower than that for walking at either 3.2 km/h or 4 km/h and could be considered only light intensity. The MET values for the OFE were lower than those for similar indoor fitness equipment. The results of this study provide crucial implications for public health practices concerning the development of active living environments.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</originId><fingerprint>c586d22d</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196507</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsueh-wen Chow, Chia-Hua Ho&lt;/p&gt;

Descriptive statistics and repeated-measures ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were employed. The energy expenditure and activity intensity for using an air walker at tempos of 80, 100, and 120 bpm were 50.78 ± 14.76 (2.81 ± 0.85), 59.62 ± 14.23 (3.26 ± 0.82), and 65.62 ± 18.27 (3.55 ± 1.02) cal/kg/min (METs), respectively. The induced energy and intensity output values for a ski machine were 54.00 ± 14.31 (3.02 ± 0.87), 68.87 ± 22.74 (3.82 ± 1.35), and 74.55 ± 23.39 (4.05 ± 1.35) cal/kg/min (METs), at 80, 100, and 120 bpm, respectively. The energy output for a waist twister at 60 bpm was 38.43 ± 20.16 cal/kg/min (2.05 ± 1.15 METs), and that for a double arm stretch at 80 bpm was 31.05 ± 12.58 cal/kg/min (1.63 ± 0.70 METs). These findings indicate that activity on the ski machine and air walker could be considered to have moderate intensity, whereas the intensity of activity on the waist twister and double arm stretch was significantly lower than that for walking at either 3.2 km/h or 4 km/h and could be considered only light intensity. The MET values for the OFE were lower than those for similar indoor fitness equipment. The results of this study provide crucial implications for public health practices concerning the development of active living environments.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Does the use of outdoor fitness equipment by older adults qualify as moderate to vigorous physical activity?</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525122000000</updated></item><item><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36444:93d646dc</id><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25854-2</link><author><name>Jennifer A.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Systems (UAV or UAS) have become increasingly popular in recent years for agricultural research applications. UAS are capable of acquiring images with high spatial and temporal resolutions that are ideal for applications in agriculture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a UAS-based remote sensing system for quantification of crop growth parameters of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and yield. The study was conducted at the Texas A&amp;amp;M Research Farm near College Station, Texas, United States. A fixed-wing UAS equipped with a multispectral sensor was used to collect image data during the 2016 growing season (April–October). Flight missions were successfully carried out at 50 days after planting (DAP; 25 May), 66 DAP (10 June) and 74 DAP (18 June). These flight missions provided image data covering the middle growth period of sorghum with a spatial resolution of approximately 6.5 cm. Field measurements of LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were also collected. Four vegetation indices were calculated using the UAS images. Among those indices, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed the highest correlation with LAI, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and yield with R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; values of 0.91, 0.89 and 0.58 respectively. Empirical relationships between NDVI and LAI and between NDVI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; were validated and proved to be accurate for estimating LAI and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; from UAS-derived NDVI values. NDVI determined from UAS imagery acquired during the flowering stage (74 DAP) was found to be the most highly correlated with final grain yield. The observed high correlations between UAS-derived NDVI and the crop growth parameters (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, LAI and grain yield) suggests the applicability of UAS for within-season data collection of agricultural crops such as sorghum.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</originId><fingerprint>fc7497e8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196605</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sanaz Shafian, Nithya Rajan, Ronnie Schnell, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan, John Valasek, Yeyin Shi, Jeff Olsenholler&lt;/p&gt;

In practice, the positions of the Drude particles experiencing the solvent reaction field arising from the fixed charges and induced polarization of the solute must be optimized in a self‐consistent manner. Here, we parameterized the model to reproduce experimental solvation free energies of a set of small molecules. The model reproduces well‐experimental solvation free energies of 70 molecules, yielding a root mean square difference of 0.8 kcal/mol versus 2.5 kcal/mol for the CHARMM36 additive force field. The polarization work associated with the solute transfer from the gas‐phase to the polar solvent, a term neglected in the framework of additive force fields, was found to make a large contribution to the total solvation free energy, comparable to the polar solute–solvent solvation contribution. The Drude PB/SASA also reproduces well the electronic polarization from the explicit solvent simulations of a small protein, BPTI. Model validation was based on comparisons with the experimental relative binding free energies of 371 single alanine mutations. With the Drude PB/SASA model the root mean square deviation between the predicted and experimental relative binding free energies is 3.35 kcal/mol, lower than 5.11 kcal/mol computed with the CHARMM36 additive force field.

The proposed methods are better alternatives to the &apos;clustering algorithm - internal cluster validity index&apos; pipelines for estimating the number of natural clusters.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>A Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm Based on Silhouette Index for Cancer Subtype Discovery from Omics Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><unread>False</unread></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544c:93d646dc</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197800</link><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><published>1526590800000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197800</canonicalUrl><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197800</originId><fingerprint>54c228b0</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197800</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Correction: Preliminary Validation of a High Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and α-Linolenic Acid (ALA) Dietary Oil Blend: Tissue Fatty Acid Composition and Liver Proteome Response in Atlantic Salmon (&amp;lt;i&gt;Salmo salar&amp;lt;/i&gt;) Smolts</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1526590800000</updated></item><item><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1637546b790:538c02d:3dd877af</id><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/111252v2?rss=1</link><author><name>Simpkins, S.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Appropriate demand for, and supply of, high quality essential neonatal care is key to improving newborn survival but evaluating such provision has received limited attention in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; July 2014 and 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (&amp;lt;50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</originId><fingerprint>3250f42b</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Georgina A.

The Tasmanian devil (&lt;i&gt;Sarcophilus harrisii)&lt;/i&gt;, the largest extant carnivorous marsupial and endemic to Tasmania, is at the verge of extinction due to the emergence of a transmissible cancer known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD has spread over the distribution range of the species and has been responsible for a severe decline in the global devil population. To protect the Tasmanian devil from extinction in the wild, our group has focused on the development of a prophylactic vaccine. Although this work has shown that vaccine preparations using whole DFTD tumour cells supplemented with adjuvants can induce anti-DFTD immune responses, alternative strategies that induce stronger and more specific immune responses are required. In humans, heat shock proteins (HSPs) derived from tumour cells have been used instead of whole-tumour cell preparations as a source of antigens for cancer immunotherapy. As HSPs have not been studied in the Tasmanian devil, this study presents the first characterisation of HSPs in this marsupial and evaluates the suitability of these proteins as antigenic components for the enhancement of a DFTD vaccine. We show that tissues and cancer cells from the Tasmanian devil express constitutive and inducible HSP. Additionally, this study suggests that HSP derived from DFTD cancer cells are immunogenic supporting the future development of a HSP-based vaccine against DFTD.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</originId><fingerprint>7b279864</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196469</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cesar Tovar, Amanda L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Objective was to examine the temporal variation of HIV sero-discordancy in select representative countries (Kenya, Lesotho, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) in sub-Saharan Africa at different HIV epidemic scales. A sero-discordant couple is defined as a stable couple (SC) in which one partner is HIV-positive while the other is HIV-negative.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A deterministic compartmental mathematical model was constructed to describe HIV transmission dynamics. The model was pair-based, that is explicitly modeling formation of SCs and infection dynamics in both SCs and in single individuals. The model accommodated for different forms of infection statuses in SCs. Using population-based nationally-representative epidemiologic and demographic input data, historical (1980–2014) and future (2015–2030) trends of sero-discordancy and other demographic and epidemiologic indicators were projected throughout HIV epidemic phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As the epidemics emerged, about 90% of SCs affected by HIV were sero-discordant. This proportion declined to 45%-88% at epidemic peak and stabilized as the epidemics started their natural decline. The largest reductions in sero-discordancy were in high HIV-prevalence countries. As the epidemics further declined with antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up, the proportion of sero-discordant couples among HIV-affected couples was projected to increase to 70%-92% by 2030. The proportion of sero-discordant couples among all SCs increased as the epidemics emerged and evolved, then peaked at 2%-20% as the epidemics peaked, and then declined as the epidemics declined to reach 0.3%-16% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Sero-discordancy patterns varied with the evolution of the epidemics, and were affected by both epidemic phase and scale. The largest variations were found in high HIV-prevalence countries. The fraction of stable couples that are sero-discordant, as opposed to being sero-concordant positive, was projected to increase with ART scale-up and further HIV incidence decline over the coming two decades. These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196613</originId><fingerprint>f79e9a8</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196613</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne F.

These findings inform strategic planning and resource allocation for interventions among sero-discordant couples.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><title>Temporal evolution of HIV sero-discordancy patterns among stable couples in sub-Saharan Africa</title><unread>True</unread><updated>1525122000000</updated></item><item><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e35:2835af05</id><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198037</link><author><name>Elena Vallino Costassa</name></author><published>1527195600000</published><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198037</canonicalUrl><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Vallino Costassa, Antonio D’Angelo, Maria Mazza, Daniela Meloni, Elisa Baioni, Cristiana Maurella, Silvia Colussi, Nicola Martinelli, Monica Lo Faro, Elena Berrone, Alessandra Favole, Paola Crociara, Silvia Grifoni, Marina Gallo, Guerino Lombardi, Barbara Iulini, Cristina Casalone, Cristiano Corona&lt;/p&gt;
Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198037</originId><fingerprint>c79ff754</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198037</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Vallino Costassa, Antonio D’Angelo, Maria Mazza, Daniela Meloni, Elisa Baioni, Cristiana Maurella, Silvia Colussi, Nicola Martinelli, Monica Lo Faro, Elena Berrone, Alessandra Favole, Paola Crociara, Silvia Grifoni, Marina Gallo, Guerino Lombardi, Barbara Iulini, Cristina Casalone, Cristiano Corona&lt;/p&gt;

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min. These characteristics suggest that Aga-BC7050 could be used in feed and food industries and sugar processing.</description><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197067</originId><fingerprint>5a4167a5</fingerprint><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197067</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruili Zhao, Rui Zhao, Yishuai Tu, Xiaoming Zhang, Liping Deng, Xiangdong Chen&lt;/p&gt;
