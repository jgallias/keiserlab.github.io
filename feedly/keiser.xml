To study sodium homeostasis, we performed a genome-wide screen for deletion strains that show resistance to NaCl. We identified 34 NaCl-resistant strains. Among them, the largest group that consists of 10 genes related to membrane trafficking and 7 out of 10 genes are ESCRT proteins which are involved in cargo transportation into luminal vesicles within the multivesicular body. All of the ESCRT related mutants which showed sodium resistance also showed defects in vacuole fusion. To further understand the role of the ESCRT pathway in various ion homeostasis, we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various cation salts other than NaCl, including KCl, LiCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. While these ESCRT mutants showed resistance to LiCl, CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, they showed sensitivity to KCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various drugs which are known to inhibit the growth of fission yeast cells. While these ESCRT mutants were more or equally sensitive to most of the drugs tested as compared to the wild-type cells, they showed resistance to some drugs such as tamoxifen, fluorouracil and amiodarone. These results suggest that the ESCRT pathway plays important roles in drug/ion resistance of fission yeast.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>d159ddf5</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198516</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8455a:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Yikun Yang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yikun Yang, Qiannan Liu, Guanglie Jiang, Si Chen, Lina Zhou, Norihiro Sakamoto, Takayoshi Kuno, Yue Fang, Fan Yao&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with ParkinsonÂ´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>d7b9c24a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197264</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7d:2835af05</id><author><name>Anna Maria Turcato</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Maria Turcato, Marco Godi, Marica Giardini, Ilaria Arcolin, Antonio Nardone, Andrea Giordano, Marco Schieppati&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has improved organ preservation or overall survival (OS) of locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer (LAHNSCC), but in clinical trials of conventional CRT, increasing CRT intensity has not been shown to improve OS. In the Adjuvant ChemoTherapy with S-1 after curative treatment in patients with Head and Neck Cancer (ACTS-HNC) phase III study, OS of curative locoregional treatments improved more with adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium) than with tegafur/uracil (UFT). ACTS HNC study showed the significant efficacy of S-1 after curative radiotherapy in sub-analysis. We explored the efficacy of S-1 after curative CRT in a subset of patients from the ACTS-HNC study.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Patients with stage III, IVA, or IVB LAHNSCC were enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 compared with UFT as adjuvant chemotherapy after curative CRT in the ACTS-HNC study. Patients received S-1 at 80â120 mg/day in two divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest, or UFT 300 or 400 mg/day in two or three divided doses daily, for 1 year. The endpoints were OS, disease-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and post-locoregional relapse survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred eighty patients (S-1, n = 87; UFT, n = 93) were included in this study. Clinical characteristics of the S-1 and UFT arms were similar. S-1 after CRT significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22â0.93) and DMFS (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26â0.97) compared with UFT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;As adjuvant chemotherapy, S-1 demonstrated better efficacy for OS and DMFS than UFT in patients with LAHNSCC after curative CRT and may be considered a treatment option following curative CRT. For this study was not preplanned in the ACTS-HNC study, the results is hypothesis generating but not definitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>97df024c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198391</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0aa:2835af05</id><author><name>Akira Kubota</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akira Kubota, Eiji Nakatani, Kiyoaki Tsukahara, Yasuhisa Hasegawa, Hideki Takemura, Tomonori Terada, Takahide Taguchi, Kunihiko Nagahara, Hiroaki Nakatani, Kunitoshi Yoshino, Yuichiro Higaki, Shigemichi Iwae, Takeshi Beppu, Yutaka Hanamure, Kichinobu Tomita, Naoyuki Kohno, Kazuyoshi Kawabata, Satoshi Teramukai, Masato Fujii, ACTS-HNC Study Group &lt;/p&gt;

Patients received S-1 at 80â120 mg/day in two divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest, or UFT 300 or 400 mg/day in two or three divided doses daily, for 1 year. The endpoints were OS, disease-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and post-locoregional relapse survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred eighty patients (S-1, n = 87; UFT, n = 93) were included in this study. Clinical characteristics of the S-1 and UFT arms were similar. S-1 after CRT significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22â0.93) and DMFS (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26â0.97) compared with UFT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;As adjuvant chemotherapy, S-1 demonstrated better efficacy for OS and DMFS than UFT in patients with LAHNSCC after curative CRT and may be considered a treatment option following curative CRT. For this study was not preplanned in the ACTS-HNC study, the results is hypothesis generating but not definitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/XYacdIHe5VM/acs.jpcb.8b01778</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Tetronic Star Block Copolymer Micelles: Photophysical Characterization of Microenvironments and Applicability for Tuning Electron Transfer Reactions</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01778/20180523/images/medium/jp-2018-01778d_0014.gif</url><height>392</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01778</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01778</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01778/20180523/images/medium/jp-2018-01778d_0014.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01778&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. produce a broad spectrum of lipopeptide biosurfactants, among which surfactin, iturin and fengycin are widely studied families. The goals of this study were to characterize the biosurfactant activity of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. and to investigate their motility and biofilm formation capabilities. In addition, we extracted lipopeptides from these bacteria to assess their antifungal activities and analyzed these products by mass spectrometry (MS). &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;amyloliquefaciens&lt;/i&gt; FZB42, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. NH 217 and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; NH-100 exhibited excellent biosurfactant and surface spreading activities, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;atrophaeus&lt;/i&gt; 176s and &lt;i&gt;Paenibacillus polymyxa&lt;/i&gt; C1225 showed moderate activity, and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; 168 showed no activity. Strains FZB42, NH-100, NH-217, 176s and CC125 exhibited excellent biofilm formation capabilities. Lipopeptide extracts displayed good antifungal activity against various phytopathogens and their associated diseases, such as &lt;i&gt;Fusarium moniliforme&lt;/i&gt; (rice bakanae disease), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; (root rot), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; (root rot) and &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma atroviride&lt;/i&gt; (ear rot and root rot). Lipopeptide extracts of these strains also showed hemolytic activity, demonstrating their strong potential to produce surfactants. LCMS-ESI analyses identified the presence of surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the extracts of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; strains. Thus, the strains assayed in this study show potential as biocontrol agents against various &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>5ccb80d4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198107</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b781:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ambrin Sarwar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ambrin Sarwar, GÃ¼nter Brader, Erika Corretto, Gajendar Aleti, Muhammad Abaidullah, Angela Sessitsch, Fauzia Yusuf Hafeez&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Metabolic disturbances induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in pancreatic beta cells. This study aims to investigate whether a common pathway exists in the ERS induced by various chemicals, including high levels of glucose and palmitate in INS-1-3 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;ERS in INS-1-3 cells was induced by exposure cells to thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM) or palmitic acid (PA) +high glucose (HG). Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling technique was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The profile of gene expression was detected by gene oncology (GO) function and pathway enrichment analysis. Nkx6.1 over-expression was established in INS-1-3 cell lines by lentivirus infection to revert the inhibition of Nkx6.1 expression found in the situation of ERS. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression changes of key genes. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. INS-1-3 cell function was measured by glucose stimulated insulin secretion test(GSIS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As compared to control, DGE demonstrated that there were 135, 57 and 74 differentially expressed genes in TM, TG and HG+PA groups, respectively. Those differentially expressed genes were enriched to ERS, antigen processing and presentation, protein export pathways, and interestingly, the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathway. Nkx6.1 is one of common down-regulated gene in MODY signaling pathway among TM, TG and HG+PA groups.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Metabolic disturbances induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in pancreatic beta cells. This study aims to investigate whether a common pathway exists in the ERS induced by various chemicals, including high levels of glucose and palmitate in INS-1-3 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;ERS in INS-1-3 cells was induced by exposure cells to thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM) or palmitic acid (PA) +high glucose (HG). Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling technique was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The profile of gene expression was detected by gene oncology (GO) function and pathway enrichment analysis. Nkx6.1 over-expression was established in INS-1-3 cell lines by lentivirus infection to revert the inhibition of Nkx6.1 expression found in the situation of ERS. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression changes of key genes. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. INS-1-3 cell function was measured by glucose stimulated insulin secretion test(GSIS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As compared to control, DGE demonstrated that there were 135, 57 and 74 differentially expressed genes in TM, TG and HG+PA groups, respectively. Those differentially expressed genes were enriched to ERS, antigen processing and presentation, protein export pathways, and interestingly, the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathway. Nkx6.1 is one of common down-regulated gene in MODY signaling pathway among TM, TG and HG+PA groups. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 ameliorated glucolipotoxicity induced apoptosis rate by 45.4%, and increased proliferation by 40.9%. At the same time, GSIS increased by 1.82 folds.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MODY pathway genes expression was changed in the state of ERS. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 protected the INS-1-3 cells from glucolipotoxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: Effects of a Possible Pollinator Crisis on Food Crop Production in Brazil</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197396</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Genetic variants of inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) that confer reduced ITPase activity are associated with protection against ribavirin(RBV)-induced hemolytic anemia in peginterferon(IFN)/RBV-based treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients with reduced ITPase activity showed improved treatment efficacy when treated with IFN/RBV. In addition, a genetic polymorphism near the IL28B gene is associated with an improved response to IFN/RBV treatment. RBV has been an important component of IFN-containing regimens, and is currently recommended in combination with several IFN-free regimens for treatment of harder to cure HCV infections.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether genetic variations that reduce ITPase activity impact RBV-induced anemia in IFN-free/RBV regimens&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this study, genetic analyses were conducted in the PEARL-IV trial to investigate the effect of activity-reducing ITPA variants as well as IL28B polymorphism on anemia, platelet (PLT) counts, and virologic response in HCV genotype1a-infected patients treated with the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvirÂ±RBV.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Reduction in ITPase activity and homozygosity for the IL28Brs12979860 CC genotype protected against RBV-induced anemia. In patients receiving RBV, reduced ITPase activity was associated with reduced plasma RBV concentration and higher PLT counts. ITPase activity had no impact on response to DAA treatment, viral kinetics, or baseline IP-10 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates that genetics of ITPA and IL28B may help identify patients protected from RBV-induced anemia when treated with IFN-free regimens. Our work demonstrates for the first time that IL28B genetics may also have an impact on RBV-induced anemia. This may be of particular significance in patients with difficult-to-cure HCV infections, such as patients with decompensated cirrhosis where RBV-containing regimens likely will continue to be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>2d669e7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198296</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94e:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Aparna Vasanthakumar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aparna Vasanthakumar, Justin W.

Accumulating data from animal and observational human studies suggest that striatal dopamine signaling plays a role in glucose regulation, but direct evidence in humans is currently lacking.

First, we present the case of a diabetes patient who displayed strongly reduced insulin requirements after treatment with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the anterior limb of the internal capsule.

Accumulating data from animal and observational human studies suggest that striatal dopamine signaling plays a role in glucose regulation, but direct evidence in humans is currently lacking. We present a series of experiments supporting the regulation of peripheral glucose metabolism by striatal dopamine signaling.

&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; PfRH5 protein binds Ripr, CyRPA and Pf113 to form a complex that is essential for merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The inter-genomic conservation of the PfRH5 complex proteins makes them attractive blood stage vaccine candidates. However, little is known about how antibodies to PfRH5, CyRPA and Pf113 are acquired and maintained in naturally exposed populations, and the role of PfRH5 complex proteins in naturally acquired immunity. To provide such data, we studied 206 Ghanaian children between the ages of 1â12 years, who were symptomatic, asymptomatic or aparasitemic and healthy. Plasma levels of antigen-specific IgG and IgG subclasses were measured by ELISA at several time points during acute disease and convalescence. On the day of admission with acute &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; malaria, the prevalence of antibodies to PfRH5-complex proteins was low compared to other merozoite antigens (EBA175, GLURP-R0 and GLURP-R2). At convalescence, the levels of RH5-complex-specific IgG were reduced, with the decay of PfRH5-specific IgG being slower than the decay of IgG specific for CyRPA and Pf113. No correlation between IgG levels and protection against &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; malaria was observed for any of the PfRH5 complex proteins. From this we conclude that specific IgG was induced against proteins from the PfRH5-complex during acute &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; malaria, but the prevalence was low and the IgG levels decayed rapidly after treatment.

&lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; is a microorganism of great concern for the food industry and the cause of human foodborne disease. Therefore, novel methods of control are needed, and systems biology is one such approach to identify them. Using a combination of computational techniques and laboratory methods, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) can be created, validated, and used to simulate growth environments and discern metabolic capabilities of microbes of interest, including &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The objective of the work presented here was to generate GEMs for six different strains of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, and to both qualitatively and quantitatively validate these GEMs with experimental data to examine the diversity of metabolic capabilities of numerous strains from the three different serovar groups most associated with foodborne outbreaks and human disease. Following qualitative validation, 57 of the 95 carbon sources tested experimentally were present in the GEMs, and; therefore, these were the compounds from which comparisons could be drawn. Of these 57 compounds, agreement between &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results for carbon source utilization ranged from 80.7% to 91.2% between strains. Nutrient utilization agreement between &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results were also conducted for numerous nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur sources. Additionally, quantitative validation showed that the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; GEMs were able to generate &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions for growth rate and growth yield that were strongly and significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.0013 and p &amp;lt; 0.0015, respectively) correlated with experimental results. These findings are significant because they show that these GEMs for &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; are comparable to published GEMs of other organisms for agreement between &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; predictions and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results.

Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in the rat is a widely used animal model of vascular dementia and a valuable tool for preclinical pharmacological drug testing, although the varying degrees of acute focal ischemic lesions it induces could interfere with its translational value. Recently, a modification to the BCCAo model, the stepwise occlusion of the two carotid arteries, has been introduced. To acquire objective translatable measures, we used longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of semi-chronic (8 days) donepezil treatment in this model, with half of the Wistar rats receiving the treatment one week after the stepwise BCCAo. With an ultrahigh field MRI, we measured high-resolution anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging, cerebral blood flow measurements and functional MRI in response to whisker stimulation, to evaluate both the structural and functional effects of the donepezil treatment and stepwise BCCAo up to 5 weeks post-occlusion. While no large ischemic lesions were detected, atrophy in the striatum and in the neocortex, along with widespread white matter microstructural changes, were found. Donepezil ameliorated the transient drop in the somatosensory BOLD response in distant cortical areas, as detected 2 weeks after the occlusion but the drug had no effect on the long term structural changes.

Bandaging of limb wounds in horses leads to formation of exuberant granulation tissue (EGT) that retards healing due to protracted inflammation, aberrant vascularisation and delayed epithelialisation. EGT is not observed if wounds are left undressed or when wounds are on the body. A previous study showed that short-term administration of proteins derived from orf virus dampened inflammation and promoted epithelialisation of open wounds in horses. Here, we investigated the impact of orf virus interleukin-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor-E on the development and resolution of EGT. Excisional wounds were created on the forelimb of four horses, and bandages were maintained until full healing to induce EGT formation. Matching body wounds were created to ensure EGT was limited to the limb, and to differentiate the effects of the viral proteins on normal healing and on EGT formation. Viral proteins or the hydrogel vehicle control were administered topically to site-matched wounds at day 1, with repeat administration at day 8. Wound healing and EGT formation were monitored macroscopically. Wound margin samples were harvested at 2, 7 and 14 days, and at full healing, with histology used to observe epithelialisation, immunofluorescence used to detect inflammatory cells, angiogenesis and cell death, and qPCR to measure expression of genes regulating inflammation and angiogenesis. Limb wounds developed EGT, and exhibited slower healing than body wounds. Viral protein treatment did not accelerate healing at either location nor limit EGT formation in limb wounds. Treatment of limb wounds did however increase epithelialisation and angiogenesis, without dampening inflammatory cell infiltration or gene expression. The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>fc68e468</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197223</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b78:93d646dc</id><author><name>Lyn M.

The healed wounds also had less occlusion and death of blood vessels and fewer epidermal rete ridges following viral protein treatment. These findings indicate that the viral protein treatment does not suppress wound inflammation or EGT formation, but does promote vascular and epidermal repair and EGT resolution.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122614v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Quantitative agent-based modeling reveals mechanical stress response of growing tumor spheroids is predictable over various growth conditions and cell lines [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/05/122614</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/122614v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine whether vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is independently predictive of intra-amniotic infection and imminent spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD, delivery within 48 hours) in women with preterm labor with intact membranes (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. CVF samples for VDBP assays were obtained along with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels immediately after amniocentesis in consecutive women with PTL (n = 148) or PPROM (n = 103) between 23.0 and 34.0 weeks of gestation. VDBP levels in CVF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The primary outcome measures were intra-amniotic infection [defined as positive amniotic fluid (AF) culture] and SPTD within 48 hours after sampling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the multivariable analysis, elevated VDBP levels in CVF samples of PTL women were significantly associated with intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery, even after adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., gestational age at sampling, parity, and serum CRP). However, these relationships were not found in women with PPROM. In women with PTL, the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of CVF VDBP level for predicting intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery were 0.66 and 0.71, with cut-off values of 1.76 Î¼g/mL (sensitivity of 64.3% and specificity of 78.4%) and 1.37 Î¼g/mL (sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 72.6%), respectively.

The link between athlete physique and performance in sports is well established. However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean Â± standard deviation age 26.0 Â± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 Â± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 Â± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p &amp;lt; 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p &amp;lt; 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.388, p &amp;lt; 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>cd6e61a3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197761</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094068:2835af05</id><author><name>Helen Ryan-Stewart</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Helen Ryan-Stewart, James Faulkner, Simon Jobson&lt;/p&gt;

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. These tumors can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast the manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>3fdbca10</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</link><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163934cbc78:66797:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Seth Haney</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS â LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1Â° Â± 2.0Â°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;Î²&lt;/i&gt; = â0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;Î²&lt;/i&gt; = â0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee.

Background &lt;p&gt;Achieving proper rotational alignment of the femoral component in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for valgus knee is challenging because of lateral condylar hypoplasia and lateral cartilage erosion. Gap-based navigation-assisted TKA enables surgeons to determine the angle of femoral component rotation (FCR) based on the posterior condylar axis. This study evaluated the possible factors that affect the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2016, 28 knees were enrolled. The dependent variable for this study was FCR based on the posterior condylar axis, which was obtained from the navigation system archives. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify factors that might predict FCR, including body mass index (BMI), Kellgren-Lawrence grade (K-L grade), lateral distal femoral angles obtained from the navigation system and radiographs (NaviLDFA, XrayLDFA), hip-knee-ankle (HKA) axis, lateral gap under varus stress (LGVS), medial gap under valgus stress (MGVS), and side-to-side difference (STSD, MGVS â LGVS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean FCR was 6.1Â° Â± 2.0Â°. Of all the potentially predictive factors evaluated in this study, only NaviLDFA (&lt;i&gt;Î²&lt;/i&gt; = â0.668) and XrayLDFA (&lt;i&gt;Î²&lt;/i&gt; = â0.714) predicted significantly FCR.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The LDFAs, as determined using radiographs and the navigation system, were both predictive of the rotational alignment of the femoral component based on the posterior condylar axis in gap-based TKA for valgus knee. A 1Â° increment with NaviLDFA led to a 0.668Â° decrement in FCR, and a 1Â° increment with XrayLDFA led to a 0.714Â° decrement. This suggests that symmetrical lateral condylar hypoplasia of the posterior and distal side occurs in lateral compartment end-stage osteoarthritis with valgus deformity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/nLyxTJUiLk4/acs.biochem.8b00127</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] The Helicobacter pylori HypAÂ·UreE2 Complex Contains a Novel High-Affinity Ni(II)-Binding Site</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00127/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00127x_0008.gif</url><height>245</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00127/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00127x_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse geneâediting technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>68</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>284d5a5d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</link><crawled>1527616392783</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163ad084e4f:123fd5:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are important DNA lesions induced by endogenous crosslinking agents such as formaldehyde or acetaldehyde, as well as ionizing radiation, cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, and abortive action of some enzymes. Due to their very bulky nature, they are expected to interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair. DPCs are highly genotoxic and the ability of cells to deal with them is relevant for many chemotherapeutic interventions. However, interactions of DNA polymerases with DPCs have been poorly studied due to the lack of a convenient experimental model. We have used NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced trapping of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase with DNA to construct model DNA polymerase substrates containing a DPC in single-stranded template, or in the template strand of double-stranded DNA, or in the non-template (displaced) strand of double-stranded DNA. Nine DNA polymerases belonging to families A, B, X, and Y were studied with respect to their behavior upon encountering a DPC: Klenow fragment of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase I, &lt;i&gt;Pyrococcus furiosus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase, &lt;i&gt;Sulfolobus solfataricus&lt;/i&gt; DNA polymerase IV, human DNA polymerases Î², Îº and Î», and DNA polymerases from bacteriophages T4 and RB69. Although none were able to fully bypass DPCs in any context, Family B DNA polymerases (T4, RB69) and Family Y DNA polymerase IV were able to elongate the primer up to the site of the cross-link if a DPC was located in single-stranded template or in the displaced strand. In other cases, DNA synthesis stopped 4â5 nucleotides before the site of the cross-link in single-stranded template or in double-stranded DNA if the polymerases could displace the downstream strand. We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>df3ece2d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198480</link><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf7:3dd877af</id><author><name>Anna V.

We suggest that termination of DNA polymerases on a DPC is mostly due to the unrelieved conformational strain experienced by the enzyme when pressing against the cross-linked protein molecule.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/3o1NOrhardA/s41598-018-26399-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Spatially organizing biochemistry: choosing a strategy to translate synthetic biology to the factory</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26399-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26399_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>514</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26399-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26399-0</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spatially organizing biochemistry: choosing a strategy to translate synthetic biology to the factory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spatially organizing biochemistry: choosing a strategy to translate synthetic biology to the factory, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26399-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26399-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spatially organizing biochemistry: choosing a strategy to translate synthetic biology to the factory&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/3o1NOrhardA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527577200000</published><fingerprint>5c00bbab</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26399-0</link><crawled>1527585698214</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163ab33f1a6:1d6388c:3dd877af</id><author><name>Christopher M.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (AÎ²). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of AÎ² in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric AÎ², and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and AÎ², we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce AÎ² secretion and AÎ²-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>dfde1d51</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475056:2835af05</id><author><name>Sayuri Higaki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In Germany, a 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) is recommended for elderly (60+) and patients 16+ with chronic diseases not associated with immune suppression. For all other patients at risk, sequential immunization with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) first, followed by PPSV23 is recommended. Repeated vaccination with PPSV23 is recommended every 6 years after individual assessment by the physician. This was adopted into the vaccination directive with binding reimbursement and funding. However, additional voluntary services allow statutory health insurances to differentiate from each other. Aim of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voluntary service scenarios compared to the strategy in place to support informed decision making.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A microsimulation framework with Markov-type process of a population susceptible to pneumococcal disease over a lifetime horizon was developed to compare effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different vaccination strategies. We simulated 1,000 iterations for seven scenarios. Assumptions were derived from published literature and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was run to show the robustness of the model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that all voluntary service strategies could prevent further clinical cases compared to the existing policy. Depending on the scenario, 48â142 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), 24,000â45,000 hospitalized all-cause nonbacteremic pneumonia (NBP), 15,000â45,000 outpatient NBP cases, and 4,000â8,000 deaths could be avoided on average. This refers to potential savings of â¬115 Mio. - â¬187 Mio. for medical and non-medical costs. Additional costs per patient for the payer are â¬2.48 to â¬7.13 and for the society â¬2.20 to â¬6.85. The ICER per LYG ranged from â¬3,662 to â¬23,061 (payer) and â¬3,258 to â¬29,617 (societal). All but one scenario was cost-effective in â¥60% of the generated 1,000 simulations.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Compared to the vaccination strategy in place, the different hypothetical scenarios can be considered cost-effective and suitable as additional voluntary services.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>4c7bb03</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197905</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e21:2835af05</id><author><name>Ulrike Kuchenbecker</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ulrike Kuchenbecker, Daniela Chase, Anika Reichert, Julia Schiffner-Rohe, Mark Atwood&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed for the first time whether urinary free light chains (FLC) are independently associated with risk of ESRD in patients with CKD, and whether they offer incremental value in risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;We measured urinary FLCs in 556 patients with CKD from a prospective cohort study. The association between urinary kappa/creatinine (KCR) and lambda/creatinine (LCR) ratios and development of ESRD was assessed by competing-risks regression (to account for the competing risk of death). The change in C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement were used to assess the incremental value of adding KCR or LCR to the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;136 participants developed ESRD during a median follow-up time of 51 months. Significant associations between KCR and LCR and risk of ESRD became non-significant after adjustment for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), although having a KCR or LCR &gt;75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centile remained independently associated with risk of ESRD. Neither KCR nor LCR as continuous or categorical variables provided incremental value when added to the KFRE for estimating risk of ESRD at two years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Urinary FLCs have an association with progression to ESRD in patients with CKD which appears to be explained to a degree by their correlation with eGFR and ACR.

Prevalence and molecular epidemiology studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus are scarce in Warao Amerindians from Venezuela, where an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has recently been documented. To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer â¥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>c4313e9e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197662</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd71:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ruth Y.

Prevalence and molecular epidemiology studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus are scarce in Warao Amerindians from Venezuela, where an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has recently been documented. To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer â¥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0076-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Restoring vision</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0076-4/MediaObjects/41586_2018_76_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>278</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0076-4</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restoring vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring vision, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0076-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0076-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Restoring vision</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>9</engagement><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>17cb8e2d</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0076-4</link><crawled>1526490145304</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16369e72218:41980a6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Botond Roska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Restoring vision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restoring vision, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0076-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0076-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Restoring vision</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258855v4?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Causal interactions from proteomic profiles: molecular data meets pathway knowledge [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/21/258855</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258855v4?rss=1</originId><content><content>Measurement of changes in protein levels and in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can be highly informative about the phenotypic consequences of genetic differences or about the dynamics of cellular processes.

Cases were patients with a first episode of HO-HCFA CDI. Controls were patients with any other diagnosis; they were randomly selected from the hospital discharge database and matched in a 1:2 manner according to the date of diagnosis of case Â± 10 days. Variables with p&amp;lt;0.1 were considered for multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and fifty-five cases and 310 controls were included. Variables independently associated with HO-HCFA CDI were: exposure to both ciprofloxacin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within the last 3 months (OR = 8.07, 95% CI = 1.70â38.16), febrile neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI = 1.37â15.46), intraabdominal infection (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.95â4.46), referral from other hospitals (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 0.98â4.05) and an increasing number of antibiotics previously used (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13â1.46).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multiple factors were found to be associated with the first episode of HO-HCFA CDI in the setting of an outbreak; of the modifiable risk factors, prior exposure to both ciprofloxacin and PPI was the most important.

Variables independently associated with HO-HCFA CDI were: exposure to both ciprofloxacin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within the last 3 months (OR = 8.07, 95% CI = 1.70â38.16), febrile neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI = 1.37â15.46), intraabdominal infection (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.95â4.46), referral from other hospitals (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 0.98â4.05) and an increasing number of antibiotics previously used (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13â1.46).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multiple factors were found to be associated with the first episode of HO-HCFA CDI in the setting of an outbreak; of the modifiable risk factors, prior exposure to both ciprofloxacin and PPI was the most important. Referral from other hospitals was an environmental risk factor that deserves further study.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/vkyAcwCU4hU/s41598-018-25748-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>571</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25748-3/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25748_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25748-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vkyAcwCU4hU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>d80ff2eb</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3</link><crawled>1526289450172</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635df0c4bc:2e36446:93d646dc</id><author><name>Yukako Sakaguchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25748-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25748-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Roles of Enhancer RNAs in RANKL-induced Osteoclast Differentiation Identified by Genome-wide Cap-analysis of Gene Expression using CRISPR/Cas9&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/vkyAcwCU4hU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198217</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Architecture of marine food webs: To be or not be a âsmall-worldâ</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198217</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198217</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by TomÃ¡s Ignacio Marina, Leonardo A.

The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>9537158</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198217</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2c:3dd877af</id><author><name>TomÃ¡s Ignacio Marina</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by TomÃ¡s Ignacio Marina, Leonardo A.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched. These parameters were further extended to amino acids according to bead type. The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results. Importantly, the efficiency of this method is guaranteed to accelerate the assembly of vesicles composed of several thousand lipids by up to 50-fold, rendering the experimental liposome dynamics as well as membrane-peptide interactions feasible at accessible computational expense.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>d307ca52</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198049</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e37:2835af05</id><author><name>Mingwei Wan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mingwei Wan, Lianghui Gao, Weihai Fang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Globally the number of people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has risen significantly over the last few decades. Aligned to this is a growing use of community health workers (CHWs) to deliver T2DM self-management support with good clinical outcomes especially in High Income Countries (HIC). Evidence and lessons from these interventions can be useful for Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa that are experiencing a marked increase in T2DM prevalence.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to examine how CHW have been utilized to support T2DM self-management globally, their preparation for and supervision to perform their functions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The review was guided by a stepwise approach outlined in the framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and OâMalley. Peer reviewed scientific and grey literature was searched using a string of keywords, selecting English full-text articles published between 2000 and 2015. Articles were selected using inclusion criteria, charted and content analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1008 studies were identified of which 54 full text articles were selected. Most (53) of the selected studies were in HIC and targeted mostly minority populations in low resource settings. CHWs were mostly deployed to provide education, support, and advocacy. Structured curriculum based education was the most frequently reported service provided by CHWs to support T2DM self-management. Support services included informational, emotional, appraisal and instrumental support. Models of CHW care included facility linked nurse-led CHW coordination, facility-linked CHW led coordination and standalone CHW interventions without facility interaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CHWs play several roles in T2DM self-management, including structured education, ongoing support and health system advocacy.

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisitesâ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>716a322d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197960</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2c:2835af05</id><author><name>Sisi Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

Every chemical reaction is a tightrope walk. In fact, if you picture them traversing an energy surface itâs a literal tightrope walk, and you can see the narrow path that leads to the product, along with the various pits, slopes, and gulches that things can slide off into instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to figure this sort of thing out is to run a lot of careful attempts under well-controlled conditions: &lt;em&gt;scientia est experentia&lt;/em&gt;. In the drug industry, process research chemists do this because the stakes are high. People in academia who are trying to get crucial total synthesis steps to work are often in the same position, and (needless to say) so are the folks who are trying to invent new synthetic methods entirely. Most of the rest of us, though, will try a few variations while our thoughts turn to whether there are any different reagents or reactions that might be less complicated and just produce some product already. The reaction landscape is large and complex, and mapping it out in useful detail is actually rather painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/23/science.aar6236&quot;&gt;Hereâs a new paper&lt;/a&gt; that is trying another automated attack on all this. A group at Merck (with collaborators at Bruker) reports another miniaturized approach to reaction screening, this time using MALDI-TOF mass spec as the analytic end of the process. It would appear to be later work from the same initiative that produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/11/25/try_some_reactions_actually_try_them_all&quot;&gt;this earlier work&lt;/a&gt; on reaction optimization, and for more industrial chemists trying this, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/02/01/brute-force-bring-on-the-machines&quot;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; for some recent work from Pfizer. That paper investigated Suzuki-type couplings, and this new one is going after Buchwald-Hartwig ones (the carbon-nitrogen palladium-catalyzed reaction, famously &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2015/11/16/palladium-does-what-it-wants&quot;&gt;persnickety&lt;/a&gt; about catalysts and conditions). For a pain-in-the-rear reaction, though, it sure does &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/04/22/real_reactions_from_real_lab_notebooks&quot;&gt;get run a lot&lt;/a&gt;. Itâs a very worthy place to set the machines loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Merck group looked back through the companyâs electronic lab notebooks, and found plenty of such coupling reactions. But they were run under so many different conditions, and with such irregular coverage of chemical space, that it was hard to extract anything useful out of the data set. So they made their own. But they did it differently than the Pfizer group (who used flow chemistry, which requires homogeneous reactions and thus often higher dilution conditions):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;. . .Rather than accepting such constraints, we systematically engineered and validated new plate-based nanomole synthesis tools with a general ability to carry out a wide variety of typical synthetic reactions. We identified effective chemically compatible glass microplate reactors, fast 384-tip dosing of reagent solutions in volatile solvents, and designed aluminum sealing blocks that can retain volatile solvents on heating. In addition, we used LabRam resonant acoustic mixing to both agitate reactions and to create milky slurries of solid inorganic bases that can be added to reactions by parallel liquid handling. Finally, we created a nanomole scale photochemistry tool to enable reaction evaluation in the rapidly growing field of photoredox catalysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was not the work of a few idle afternoons. (A lot of information on how this was done is available in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/05/23/science.aar6236.DC1/aar6236_Lin_SM.pdf&quot;&gt;supplementary information file&lt;/a&gt; of the paper, by the way). The decision to use MALDI/TOF mass spec was motivated by the time it takes to do LC/MS work â the syringe has to come over, pull up some sample, inject it, get washed and move to the next sample while the first one is making its way down the column, etc. Itâs true that you get more information from the LC trace, but the speedup in the solid-phase MALDI technique (where a laser beam blasts the sample off the surface and into the mass spec) is hard to ignore. The group did some optimization there, looking for conditions that would give reliable readouts across a range of substrates, and worked out a procedure where aliquots of each reaction were spotted into the wells of a MALDI analysis plate (with internal standard added â without that, youâre at sea) and the appropriate matrix compound (alpha-cyano 4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added afterwards in solution, followed by evaporation. A 1536-well MALDI plate could be analyzed in about ten minutes, with automated data collection and analysis on the back end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first run of the system looked at four different coupling conditions (iridium/nickel and ruthenium/nickel photoredox, along copper-catalyzed and palladium-catalyzed conditions) to search for functional groups that could poison the reaction conditions (as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.7b00201&quot;&gt;work of the Glorius group&lt;/a&gt; on reaction &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2014/06/06/the_robustness_test_why_dont_we_just_require_it&quot;&gt;robustness&lt;/a&gt;). These four reactions were run with well-performing reactions partners in the presence of 383 other polar molecules with a wide range of functional groups. As always with the automated chemistry work, oneâs lip starts to quiver at the thought of doing this sort of thing the traditional way. That is just a &lt;em&gt;lot of work&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they found was that each of the reactions is subject to poisoning by specific functional groups. For example, the copper-catalyzed reactions are hammered by anything with a thiol group, which makes perfect sense, while the iridium reactions were not only intolerant to SH, but to acids, phenols, oximes, and nitro groups as well. Which is annoying. And when such functional groups appeared in larger, more complex additives, they were almost always just as bad. To add to the fun, there were other large molecules that contained several by-themselves-innocuous functional groups that together managed to poison the reaction as a team. Yep, this is metal-catalyzed coupling chemistry all right. (Itâs worth noting that the copper reaction actually had the most permissive profile, thiols aside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then turned to variations in the coupling partners, with a list of 192 aryl halides and 192 secondary amines. If you did all of those, youâd be looking at 36,864 possible products, and across the four reaction types that gives you a cool 147,456 experiments to set up, which was enough even to give these guys pause. They tried a sampling of that space by setting up each bromide with the most simple amine in the set, and each amine with the most simple bromide â that takes you back down to 1536 reactions, a 1% scattering fairly evenly across the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much harder row to hoe. Adding an internal standard is necessary, but a lot trickier to work out across so many reactions and structural types. The group had run that previous experiment in traditional LC/MS and found a good correlation in the results (once you normalized to the internal standard) but these 1536 experiments had a lot more scatter in them. Backing down to a pass/fail on the MALDI data (with an arbitrary cutoff) gave a much better correlation with the more comprehensive LC/MS data, so you can at least search reaction space in a âwhatâs bad?â mode, with analysis of the properties of each compound for steric hindrance, number of nitrogens, cLogP, hydrogen bond donors, etc. Rather particular structural features turn out to be reproducibly important for success and failure in the Cu-catalyzed versus the Pd-catalyzed reactions, and several of these cannot predicted by our current understanding of the reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper refers to the âdark matterâ of chemical reactivity, and thereâs some of it for you: things that you wouldnât have known would affect the reaction, and do so for reasons that arenât yet clear. These coupling reactions are particularly tricky to work out, but there are plenty of other examples in all fields of synthetic chemistry. (Going back to my grad school work, I can give examples of small changes across carbohydrate structures that totally change their reactivity, in ways that I often discovered in the most painful ways possible!) Every class of compounds and every class of reactions has things like this, results that just make you throw up your hands. If thereâs a way to start mapping out the vast âJust One of Those Thingsâ spaces, weâll learn a lot more about the chemistry weâre supposed to already understand by doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1528292688000</published><fingerprint>a064a7cd</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13587</link><crawled>1528292909751</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163d55b22b7:5de2448:2835af05</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>Why do our reactions fail?

Background &lt;p&gt;Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is minimal invasive techniques to reconstruct the vertebral height and prevent further collapse of the fractured vertebrae by injecting polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral body. However, recompression of polymethylmethacrylate augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggressive local kyphotic was observed frequently after VP or KP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film.

Background &lt;p&gt;Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is minimal invasive techniques to reconstruct the vertebral height and prevent further collapse of the fractured vertebrae by injecting polymethylmethacrylate into vertebral body. However, recompression of polymethylmethacrylate augmented vertebrae with significant vertebral height loss and aggressive local kyphotic was observed frequently after VP or KP. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of polymethylmethacrylate distribution on recompression of the vertebral body after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty surgery for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 281 patients who were diagnosed with vertebral compression fracture (T5-L5) from June 2014 to June 2016 and underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty by polymethylmethacrylate were retrospectively analyzed. The X-ray films at 1 day and 12 months after surgery were compared to evaluate the recompression of operated vertebral body. Patients were divided into those without recompression (non-recompression group) and those with recompression (recompression group). Polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern, including location and relationship to endplates, was compared between the two groups by lateral X-ray film. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the potential risk factors associated with polymethylmethacrylate distribution for recompression.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and six (37.7%) patients experienced recompression after surgery during the follow-up period. The polymethylmethacrylate distributed in the middle of vertebral body showed significant differences between two groups. In non-recompression group, the polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body were closer to endplates than that in the recompression group (upper: t = 31.41, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001; lower: t = 12.19, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The higher percentage of the height of polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body indicates the lower risk of recompression (odds ratio [OR]&amp;lt;0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The recompression group and non-recompression group showed significant difference in âcontactedâ polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern (polymethylmethacrylate contacted to the both upper/lower endplates) (&lt;i&gt;Ï&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 66.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). The vertebra with a âcontactedâ polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern has lower risk of recompression (OR = 0.09, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Either more polymethylmethacrylate in the middle portion of vertebral body or âcontactedâ polymethylmethacrylate distribution pattern had a significantly less incidence of recompression.

Ligand binding sites in proteins are often localized to deeply buried cavities, inaccessible to bulk solvent. Yet, in many cases binding of cognate ligands occurs rapidly. An intriguing system is presented by the L99A cavity mutant of T4 Lysozyme (T4L L99A) that rapidly binds benzene (~10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Although the protein has long served as a model system for protein thermodynamics and crystal structures of both free and benzene-bound T4L L99A are available, the kinetic pathways by which benzene reaches its solvent-inaccessible binding cavity remain elusive. The current work, using extensive molecular dynamics simulation, achieves this by capturing the complete process of spontaneous recognition of benzene by T4L L99A at atomistic resolution. A series of multi-microsecond unbiased molecular dynamics simulation trajectories unequivocally reveal how benzene, starting in bulk solvent, diffuses to the protein and spontaneously reaches the solvent inaccessible cavity of T4L L99A. The simulated and high-resolution X-ray derived bound structures are in excellent agreement. A robust four-state Markov model, developed using cumulative 60 Î¼s trajectories, identifies and quantifies &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding pathways with low activation barriers. Interestingly, none of these identified binding pathways required large conformational changes for ligand access to the buried cavity. Rather, these involve transient but crucial opening of a channel to the cavity via subtle displacements in the positions of key helices (helix4/helix6, helix7/helix9) leading to rapid binding. Free energy simulations further elucidate that these channel-opening events would have been unfavorable in wild type T4L. Taken together and via integrating with results from experiments, these simulations provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into the complete ligand recognition process in a buried cavity. By illustrating the power of subtle helix movements in opening up &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; pathways for ligand access, this work offers an alternate view of ligand recognition in a solvent-inaccessible cavity, contrary to the common perception of a &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; dominant pathway for ligand binding.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v22HP1dNVjw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>43541b1d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006180</link><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:1321:910a81bb</id><author><name>Jagannath Mondal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagannath Mondal, Navjeet Ahalawat, Subhendu Pandit, Lewis E.

Success rates for catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation patients are currently low; however, there is a subset of patients for whom electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins alone is a successful treatment strategy. It is difficult to identify these patients because there are a multitude of factors affecting arrhythmia susceptibility and maintenance, and the individual contributions of these factors are difficult to determine clinically. We hypothesised that the combination of pulmonary vein (PV) electrophysiology and atrial body fibrosis determine driver location and effectiveness of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We used bilayer biatrial computer models based on patient geometries to investigate the effects of PV properties and atrial fibrosis on arrhythmia inducibility, maintenance mechanisms, and the outcome of PVI. Short PV action potential duration (APD) increased arrhythmia susceptibility, while longer PV APD was found to be protective. Arrhythmia inducibility increased with slower conduction velocity (CV) at the LA/PV junction, but not for cases with homogeneous CV changes or slower CV at the distal PV. Phase singularity (PS) density in the PV region for cases with PV fibrosis was increased. Arrhythmia dynamics depend on both PV properties and fibrosis distribution, varying from meandering rotors to PV reentry (in cases with baseline or long APD), to stable rotors at regions of high fibrosis density. Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>ceb5f065</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006166</link><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163934cbc78:66798:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Caroline H.

Measurement of fibrosis and PV properties may indicate patient specific susceptibility to AF initiation and maintenance. PV PS density before PVI was higher for cases in which AF terminated or converted to a macroreentry; thus, high PV PS density may indicate likelihood of PVI success.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rn0Tfj7bu6A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/yr1bmpkAwro/s41467-018-04515-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04515-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04515-y</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04515-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04515-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/yr1bmpkAwro&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526972400000</published><fingerprint>10d7cec</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04515-y</link><crawled>1526981344788</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163872e3e14:6d409f7:2835af05</id><author><name>Salvatore Corallino</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04515-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04515-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: A RAB35-p85/PI3K axis controls oscillatory apical protrusions required for efficient chemotactic migration&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/yr1bmpkAwro&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/Nh8XOC-_UnI/s41467-018-04480-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Total synthesis of cyrneines AâB and glaucopine C</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>477</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04480-6/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4480_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total synthesis of cyrneines AâB and glaucopine C&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total synthesis of cyrneines AâB and glaucopine C, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04480-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04480-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cyrneine diterpenoids represent a biologically important subfamily of cyathane-type diterpenoids.

Although numerous studies have investigated the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately each other, it is unclear whether an association between neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity is present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional changes in hippocampus before and after treatment with escitalopram and to associate these changes with peptides related to neuronal growth in patients with chronic PTSD and trauma survivors without PTSD. Fifteen earthquake survivors with chronic PTSD and thirteen drug naÃ¯ve trauma exposed individuals without PTSD underwent fMRI scans in a block design. Serum levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were measured before and after 12 weeks treatment with escitalopram. Baseline median serum level of NGF was significantly lower in patients with chronic PTSD than trauma survivors; however, 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly increased it. Higher activation was found both in left and right hippocampus for chronic PTSD group than trauma survivors. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with suppression of the hyperactivation in left hippocampus in patients with chronic PTSD. Bilateral hyperactivation in hippocampus and lowered NGF may associate with neurobiological disarrangements in chronic PTSD. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with both improvement in the severity of PTSD symptoms and biological alterations. Patients diagnosed with PTSD may have further and complicated deteriorations in hippocampal networks and neurotransmitter systems than individuals who had not been diagnosed with PTSD following the same traumatic experience.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>1f09d48</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197889</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd7c:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ãmit Tural</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ãmit Tural, Ahmet Tamer Aker, Emin Ãnder, Hatice Turan Sodan, Hatice Ãnver, GÃ¼r Akansel&lt;/p&gt;

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region.

Two-pore domain K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels (K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for background K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents and regulate the resting membrane potential and cellular excitability. Their activity is controlled by a large variety of physicochemical factors and intracellular signaling pathways. The majority of these effects converge on the intracellular C-terminus of the channels, resulting in the modification of the gating at the selectivity filter. Another gating mechanism, the activation gate at the helix bundle crossing is also well documented in other K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel families, however, it remains uncertain whether this type of gating is functional in K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. The regulation of TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (TRESK) is different from the other K&lt;sub&gt;2P&lt;/sub&gt; channels. Regulatory factors acting via the C-terminus are not known, instead channel activity is modified by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unusually long intracellular loop between the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane segments. These unique structural elements of the regulation lead us to examine channel gating at the bundle crossing region. Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was applied to the intracellular side of excised membrane patches and the characteristics of the channel block were determined. We compared the kinetics of the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block when the channels were phosphorylated (inhibited) or dephosphorylated (activated) and also in different mutants mimicking the two functional states. Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5030665?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Clustering mechanism of oxocarboxylic acids involving hydration reaction: Implications for the atmospheric models</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5030665?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528178609000</published><fingerprint>c7ffe410</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5030665?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c511f:2835af05</id><author><name>Ling Liu</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05353-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Fur seals can go weeks without REM sleep</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05353-0/d41586-018-05353-0_15823842.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05353-0</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fur seals can go weeks without REM sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fur seals can go weeks without REM sleep, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05353-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05353-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Animals switch off need for restorative sleep phase while at sea without experiencing any apparent ill effects.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>122</engagement><published>1528354800000</published><fingerprint>14013f7c</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05353-0</link><crawled>1528384246532</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163daccd304:666e304:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Alex Fox</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fur seals can go weeks without REM sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fur seals can go weeks without REM sleep, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05353-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05353-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Animals switch off need for restorative sleep phase while at sea without experiencing any apparent ill effects.</description><engagementRate>2.26</engagementRate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/530/eaao6847?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><title>A DGK{zeta}-FoxO-ubiquitin proteolytic axis controls fiber size during skeletal muscle remodeling</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/530/eaao6847.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/530/eaao6847?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Skeletal muscle rapidly remodels in response to various stresses, and the resulting changes in muscle mass profoundly influence our health and quality of life.

New biotic stresses have emerged around the globe over the last decades threatening food safety and security. In 2016, scientists confirmed the presence of the devastating wheat-blast disease in Bangladesh, South Asiaâits first occurrence outside South America. Severely blast-affected wheat fields had their grain yield wiped out. This poses a severe threat to food security in a densely-populated region with millions of poor inhabitants where wheat is a major staple crop and per capita wheat consumption has been increasing. As an &lt;i&gt;ex ante&lt;/i&gt; impact assessment, this study examined potential wheat-blast scenarios in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Based on the agro-climatic conditions in the epicenter, where the disease was first identified in Bangladesh in 2016, this study identified the correspondingly vulnerable areas in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh amounting to 7 million ha. Assuming a conservative scenario of 5â10% for blast-induced wheat production loss, this study estimated the annual potential wheat loss across the sampled countries to be 0.89â1.77 million tons, equivalent to USD 132â264 million. Such losses further threaten an already-precarious national food security, putting pressure on wheat imports and wheat prices. The study is a call for action to tackle the real wheat-blast threat in South Asia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>dfd5ae39</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197555</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761230:93d646dc</id><author><name>Khondoker Abdul Mottaleb</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Khondoker Abdul Mottaleb, Pawan Kumar Singh, Kai Sonder, Gideon Kruseman, Thakur Prasad Tiwari, Naresh C.

The study is a call for action to tackle the real wheat-blast threat in South Asia.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dIhfnsh7r1k/s41598-018-27007-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Laminarinase from Flavobacterium sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27007-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27007-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&amp;lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27007-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-27007-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dIhfnsh7r1k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528268400000</published><fingerprint>fe731883</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27007-x</link><crawled>1528237067844</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163d2070e44:58d7154:2835af05</id><author><name>Hui-Min Qin</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &amp;lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&amp;lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27007-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-27007-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Laminarinase from &lt;i&gt;Flavobacterium&lt;/i&gt; sp. reveals the structural basis of thermostability and substrate specificity&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dIhfnsh7r1k&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/ztaSiptGfsI/nrd.2018.77</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Cryo-EM in drug discovery: achievements, limitations and prospects</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.77</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.77</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cryo-EM in drug discovery: achievements, limitations and prospects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryo-EM in drug discovery: achievements, limitations and prospects, Published online: 08 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.77&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.77&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Recent technological advances with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) â a biophysical technique that can be used to determine the structure of biological macromolecules and assemblies â have raised hopes that it might soon become an important tool for drug discovery, particularly for &apos;intractable&apos; targets that are still not accessible to analysis by X-ray crystallography.

In mouse and human kidney disease, these transitions were shifted toward a principal cell fate and were associated with metabolic acidosis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/758?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/NcmWudnZgjY/s41598-018-25615-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25615-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/NcmWudnZgjY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526972400000</published><fingerprint>d85a1ff8</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1</link><crawled>1526941276364</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16384cad8cc:66955f6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Marie Brossard-Racine</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25615-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25615-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Altered Cerebellar Biochemical Profiles in Infants Born Prematurely&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/NcmWudnZgjY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Rapid acquisition and model-based analysis of cell-free transcription-translation reactions from nonmodel bacteria [Applied Biological Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/E4340/F1.medium.gif</url><height>290</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Native cell-free transcriptionâtranslation systems offer a rapid route to characterize the regulatory elements (promoters, transcription factors) for gene expression from nonmodel microbial hosts, which can be difficult to assess through traditional in vivo approaches.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2Ã10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination.

The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>69232b1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197869</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094073:2835af05</id><author><name>Desiree R.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>fb4f7ece</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7222:2835af05</id><author><name>Atiq Hassan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model.

Newcastle disease (ND) causes severe economic loss to poultry industry worldwide. Frequent outbreaks of ND in commercial chickens vaccinated with live vaccines suggest a need to develop improved vaccines that are genetically matched against circulating Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains. In this study, the fusion protein cleavage site (FPCS) sequence of NDV strain Banjarmasin/010 (Banj), a genotype VII NDV, was individually modified using primer mutagenesis to those of avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes 2, 7 and 8 and compared with the recombinant Banjarmasin (rBanj) with avirulent NDV LaSota cleavage site (rBanj-LaSota). These FPCS mutations changed the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell-to-cell fusion activity and made rBanj FPCS mutant viruses highly attenuated in chickens. When chickens immunized with the rBanj FPCS mutant viruses and challenged with the virulent Banj, there was reduced challenge virus shedding observed compared to chickens immunized with the heterologous vaccine strain LaSota. Among the genotype VII NDV Banj vaccine candidates, rBanj-LaSota and rBanj containing FPCS of APMV-8 induced highest neutralizing antibody titers and protected chickens with reduced challenge virus shedding. These results show the effect of the F protein cleavage site sequence in generating genotype VII matched NDV vaccines.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>721947cc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197253</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219d:93d646dc</id><author><name>Vinoth K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Primary ventral hernia (PVH) and incisional hernia (IH) repair using a mesh appears to reduce hernia recurrence. However, are the benefits of mesh offset in part by mesh-related complications? The aim of this study was to compare placement of a mesh versus simple suture for recurrence and postoperative complications in the repair of PVH or IH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Five databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The study population was patients with a PVH or IH undergoing hernia repair. Intervention was placement of a nonabsorbable synthetic mesh, regardless of mesh location, surgical technique, hernia characteristics or surgical setting compared to primary suture. Primary outcome was the incidence of hernia recurrence. Secondary outcomes were wound infection, hematoma, seroma, postsurgical pain, duration of operation, and quality of life. A random-effects meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;10 RCTs with a total of 1270 patients were included.

Pesticides are one of the most widely used pest and disease control measures in plant crops and their indiscriminate use poses a direct risk to the health of populations and environment around the world. As a result, there is a great need for the development of new, less toxic molecules to be employed against plant pathogens. In this work, we employed an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;), tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) and corn (&lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets. By combining sequence and structural data, we obtained an initial set of 568 cases of analogy, of which 97 were validated and further refined, revealing a subset of 29 essential enzymatic activities with a total of 119 different structural forms, most belonging to central metabolic routes, including the carbohydrate metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids, among others. Further, another subset of 26 enzymatic activities possess a tertiary structure specific for the pathogen, not present in plants, men and &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, which may be of importance for the development of specific enzymatic inhibitors against plant diseases that are less harmful to humans and the environment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>14</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>5de8718d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197511</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6d:3dd877af</id><author><name>Rangeline Azevedo da Silva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangeline Azevedo da Silva, Leandro de Mattos Pereira, Melise Chaves Silveira, Rodrigo Jardim, Antonio Basilio de Miranda&lt;/p&gt;
Pesticides are one of the most widely used pest and disease control measures in plant crops and their indiscriminate use poses a direct risk to the health of populations and environment around the world. As a result, there is a great need for the development of new, less toxic molecules to be employed against plant pathogens. In this work, we employed an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;), tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) and corn (&lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets.

Our work demonstrates an urgent need of cell lines that more closely resemble Basal-like metastatic breast cancer samples, and could guide cell line selection in other metastasis-related translational research.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~3/E2kGxDchoTI/nrd.2018.79</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nrd/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.79</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.79</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.79&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/E2kGxDchoTI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>55bad29f</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.79</link><crawled>1527657172334</crawled><id>YLwIhSxZAzQIEnJq1FGGcXUQMCbQUlr9cyNMExMVeyY=_163af768d6e:24f0000:2835af05</id><author><name>Sarah Crunkhorn</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2018.79&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Autoimmune disease: Targeting glucose transport in psoriasis&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nrd/rss/current/~4/E2kGxDchoTI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><keywords><item>Letters</item></keywords><title>Shortcomings of the immunological model of carcinogenesis [Biological Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4318</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4318.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>With great enthusiasm, I read the PNAS article by Palmer et al. entitled âThymic involution and rising disease incidence with ageâ (1).

Pagetâs disease of bone (PDB) is a chronic bone disorder and although genetic factors appear to play an important role in its pathogenesis, to date PDB causing mutations were identified only in the &lt;i&gt;Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)&lt;/i&gt; gene at the &lt;i&gt;PDB3&lt;/i&gt; locus. &lt;i&gt;PDB6&lt;/i&gt; locus, also previously linked to PDB, contains several candidate genes for metabolic bone diseases. We focused our analysis in the most significantly associated variant with PDB, within the &lt;i&gt;Optineurin&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;OPTN)&lt;/i&gt; gene, i.e. the common variant rs1561570. Although it was previously shown to be strongly associated with PDB in several populations, its contribution to PDB pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we have shown that rs1561570 may contribute to PDB since its &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele results in the loss of a methylation site in patientsâ DNA, leading to higher levels of &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; gene expression and a corresponding increase in protein levels in patientsâ osteoclasts. This increase in &lt;i&gt;OPTN&lt;/i&gt; expression leads to higher levels of NF-ÎºB translocation into the nucleus and increasing expression of its target genes, which may contribute to the overactivity of osteoclasts observed in PDB. We also reported a tendency for a more severe clinical phenotype in the presence of a haplotype containing the rs1561570 &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; allele, which appear to be re-enforced with the presence of the &lt;i&gt;SQSTM1/P392L&lt;/i&gt; mutation.

We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions among 1,541 TFs, and evaluated how the different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity changes. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies with a confidence score, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4863.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Trends in continental temperature and humidity directly linked to ocean warming [Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4863</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4863.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>In recent decades, the land surface has warmed substantially more than the ocean surface, and relative humidity has fallen over land.

We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHughâNagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-Î¼m thick) obtained from a 20â28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate âsynaptic plasticityâ by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>d6ccead6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198396</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8454e:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Mikhail A.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex.

The dopamine (DA) hypothesis of cognitive deficits suggests that too low or too high extracellular DA concentration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) can severely impair the working memory (WM) maintenance during delay period. Thus, there exists only an optimal range of DA where the sustained-firing activity, the neural correlate of WM maintenance, in the cortex possesses optimal firing frequency as well as robustness against noisy distractions. Empirical evidences demonstrate changes even in the D1 receptor (D1R)-sensitivity to extracellular DA, collectively manifested through D1R density and DA-binding affinity, in the PFC under neuropsychiatric conditions such as ageing and schizophrenia. However, the impact of alterations in the cortical D1R-sensitivity on WM maintenance has yet remained poorly addressed. Using a quantitative neural mass model of the prefronto-mesoprefrontal system, the present study reveals that higher D1R-sensitivity may not only effectuate shrunk optimal DA range but also shift of the range to lower concentrations. Moreover, higher sensitivity may significantly reduce the WM-robustness even within the optimal DA range and exacerbates the decline at abnormal DA levels. These findings project important clinical implications, such as dosage precision and variability of DA-correcting drugs across patients, and failure in acquiring healthy WM maintenance even under drug-controlled normal cortical DA levels.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>7645fa2b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198136</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c23:3dd877af</id><author><name>Melissa Reneaux</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa Reneaux, Rahul Gupta&lt;/p&gt;

Names 2013 (the âBlue Bookâ) were analyzed by an international team of cheminformatics software
developers. Algorithms for machine implementation were designed, tested, and cross-validated.
Deficiencies in Sequence Rules 1b and 2 were found, and proposed language for their modification
is presented. A concise definition of an additional rule (âRule 6,â below) is proposed, which
succinctly covers several cases only tangentially mentioned in the 2013 recommendations. Each
rule is discussed from the perspective of machine implementation. The four resultant
implementations are supported by validation suites in 2D and 3D SDF format as well as SMILES.
The validation suites include all significant examples in Chapter 9 of the Blue Book, as well as
several additional structures that highlight more complex aspects of the rules not addressed or not
clearly analyzed in that work. These additional structures support a case for the need for

Names 2013 (the âBlue Bookâ) were analyzed by an international team of cheminformatics software
developers. Algorithms for machine implementation were designed, tested, and cross-validated.
Deficiencies in Sequence Rules 1b and 2 were found, and proposed language for their modification
is presented. A concise definition of an additional rule (âRule 6,â below) is proposed, which
succinctly covers several cases only tangentially mentioned in the 2013 recommendations. Each
rule is discussed from the perspective of machine implementation. The four resultant
implementations are supported by validation suites in 2D and 3D SDF format as well as SMILES.
The validation suites include all significant examples in Chapter 9 of the Blue Book, as well as
several additional structures that highlight more complex aspects of the rules not addressed or not
clearly analyzed in that work. These additional structures support a case for the need for
modifications of the Sequence Rules.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/749-e?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Watching magnetic atoms thermalize</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/749.5.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/749-e?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526578752000</published><fingerprint>b0ecf09e</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/749-e?rss=1</link><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395b2:3dd877af</id><author><name>Stajic, J.</name></author></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024975?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Force-induced rupture of double-stranded DNA in the absence and presence of covalently bonded anti-tumor drugs: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024975?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528179193000</published><fingerprint>cd324535</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024975?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c5124:2835af05</id><author><name>Anurag Upadhyaya</name></author><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198188</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Immunomodulation and effects on microbiota after &amp;lt;i&gt;in ovo&amp;lt;/i&gt; administration of chicken cathelicidin-2</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198188</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198188</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tryntsje Cuperus, Marina D.

Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) such as cathelicidins are multifunctional effectors of the innate immune system with both antimicrobial and pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions. Chicken cathelicidin-2 (CATH-2) has multiple immunomodulatory effects &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and the D-amino acid analog of this peptide has been shown to partially protect young chicks from a bacterial infection. However, the mechanisms responsible for CATH-2 mediated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protection have not been investigated so far. In this study, D-CATH-2 was administered &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; and the immune status and microbiota of the chicks were investigated at 7 days posthatch to elucidate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; mechanisms of the peptide. In three consecutive studies, no effects on numbers and functions of immune cells were found and only small changes were seen in gene expression of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). In two studies, intestinal microbiota composition was determined which was highly variable, suggesting that it was strongly influenced by environmental factors. In both studies, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; D-CATH-2 treatment caused significant reduction of Ruminococcaceae and &lt;i&gt;Butyricicoccus&lt;/i&gt; in the cecum and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia/Shigella&lt;/i&gt; in both ileum and cecum. In conclusion, this study shows that, in the absence of an infectious stimulus, &lt;i&gt;in ovo&lt;/i&gt; administration of a CATH-2 analog alters the microbiota composition but does not affect the chicksâ immune system posthatch.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>83da25cf</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198188</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc3:3dd877af</id><author><name>Tryntsje Cuperus</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tryntsje Cuperus, Marina D.

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and âcleanâ adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>8f44eb7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197731</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85440:93d646dc</id><author><name>Akram El Kateb</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres RÃ¼ggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 Â± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 Â± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (Î·&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (Î·&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (Î·&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (Î·&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>52</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>c1760e1d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198319</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b94f:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Henrique Pereira Neiva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, LuÃ­s BrandÃ£o FaÃ­l, Mikel Izquierdo, MÃ¡rio C.

These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5926.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Acoustic evolution of old Italian violins from Amati to Stradivari [Psychological and Cognitive Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5926</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>440</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/23/5926/F1.medium.gif</url><height>318</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5926.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The shape and design of the modern violin are largely influenced by two makers from Cremona, Italy: The instrument was invented by Andrea Amati and then improved by Antonio Stradivari.

Background &lt;p&gt;Placental dysfunction is related to many pregnancy complications, but collecting placental specimens for investigation in large scale epidemiologic studies is often infeasible. Standard procedures involving immediate collection after birth and snap freezing are often cost prohibitive. We aimed to collect pilot data regarding the feasibility and precision of a simpler approach, the collection of tissue samples following 24 hours of refrigeration of whole placentae at 4Â°C, as compared to the âgold standardâ of snap freezing excised tissue within 40 minutes of delivery for the assessment of inflammatory cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Placentae were collected from 12 women after delivering live-born singleton babies via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. Two placentae were utilized to establish laboratory tissue processing and assay protocols. The other 10 placentae were utilized in a comparison of three tissue collection conditions. Specifically, key inflammatory cytokines were measured in 3 sections, representing three collection conditions. Sections 1 (full thickness) and 2 (excised prior to freezing) were obtained within 40 minutes of delivery and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and section 3 (full thickness) was obtained after refrigerating the placenta at 4Â°C for 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8 all had comparable concentrations and variability overall in all three section types. Levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) were too low among samples to reliably measure using immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Refrigeration of placentae prior to processing does not appear to compromise detection of these cytokines for purposes of large scale studies.

Background &lt;p&gt;The nature of the relationship between fatigue and its risk factors is poorly understood. In the present study the genetic and environmental association between anxiety-depression, musculoskeletal (MS) pain and fatigue was examined, and the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between these phenotypes was investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal twin design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The sample consisted of 746 monozygotic (MZ) and 770 dizygotic (DZ) twins in the age group of 50â65 (mean = 57.11 years, SD = 4.5). Continuous measures of fatigue symptoms and the other phenotypes were employed. Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on the phenotypes, and the associations among them, were determined. Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13â19 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40â0.53 range were demonstrated.

Background &lt;p&gt;The nature of the relationship between fatigue and its risk factors is poorly understood. In the present study the genetic and environmental association between anxiety-depression, musculoskeletal (MS) pain and fatigue was examined, and the role of neuroticism as a shared risk factor that may possibly explain the co-occurrence between these phenotypes was investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal twin design.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The sample consisted of 746 monozygotic (MZ) and 770 dizygotic (DZ) twins in the age group of 50â65 (mean = 57.11 years, SD = 4.5). Continuous measures of fatigue symptoms and the other phenotypes were employed. Using Cholesky modeling, genetic and environmental influences on the phenotypes, and the associations among them, were determined. Analyses were performed using measures of neuroticism obtained concurrently and 13â19 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Results from multiple regression analyses showed that neuroticism, anxiety-depression symptoms, and MS pain were all significantly associated with fatigue, controlling for sex, education, and general health indices. The best-fitting biometric models included additive genetic and individual-specific environmental effects. Heritabilities in the 0.40â0.53 range were demonstrated. Furthermore, while there was a considerable overlap in genetic risk factors between the four phenotypes, a substantial proportion of the genetic risk shared between anxiety-depression and fatigue, and between MS pain and fatigue, was independent of neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Evidence for a common underlying susceptibility to report fatigue symptoms, genetically linked to neuroticism, anxiety-depression, and MS pain, was found.

Microorganisms respond to a variety of metabolic perturbations by repurposing or recruiting pathways to reroute metabolic flux and overcome the perturbation. Elimination of the 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, PanE, both reduces total coenzyme A (CoA) levels and causes a conditional HMP-P auxotrophy in &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;. CoA or acetyl-CoA has no demonstrable effect on the HMP-P synthase, ThiC, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Suppressors aimed at probing the connection between the biosynthesis of thiamine and CoA contained mutations in the gene encoding the &lt;i&gt;ilvC&lt;/i&gt; transcriptional regulator, &lt;i&gt;ilvY&lt;/i&gt;. These mutations may help inform the structure and mechanism of action for the effector-binding domain, as they represent the first sequenced substitutions in the effector-binding domain of IlvY that cause constitutive expression of &lt;i&gt;ilvC&lt;/i&gt;.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>27565fc4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559161:93d646dc</id><author><name>Nathan K.

In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5570.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Ca2+-activated Cl current predominates in threshold response of mouse olfactory receptor neurons [Neuroscience]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5570</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/21.cover-source.jpg?itok=3_ebjn-v</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5570.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>In mammalian olfactory transduction, odorants activate a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway that leads to the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG), nonselective cation channels and depolarization.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions.

Together, the outputs of aRchaic provide a concise visual summary of DNA damage patterns, as well as other processes generating mismatches in the data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25351?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Tyrosine absorption spectroscopy: Backbone protonation effects on the side chain electronic properties</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The UVâvis spectrum of Tyrosine and its response to different backbone protonation states have been studied by applying the Perturbed Matrix Method (PMM) in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Health status (asthma, depression, BMI, and general health), health behaviors (influenza vaccination, health insurance, smoking, and physical activity), and demographic characteristics of the two MTurk populations (workers and masters) were compared to each other and, using Poisson regression, to a nationally-representative BRFSS and NHANES samples.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Workers and master demographics were similar. MTurk users were more likely to be aged under 50 years compared to the national sample (86% vs. 55%) and more likely to complete a college degree than the national sample (50% vs. 26%). Adjusting for covariates, MTurk users were less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, to smoke, to have asthma, to self-report being in excellent or very good health, to exercise, and have health insurance but over twice as likely to screen positive for depression relative to a national sample. Results were fairly consistent among different age groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MTurk workers are not a generalizable population with regards to health status and behaviors; deviations did not follow a trend.

Background &lt;p&gt;Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can produce false positive (FP) results in patients with human African trypanosomiasis and rheumatoid factor (RF), but specificity against other infectious agents and immunological factors is largely unknown. Low diagnostic specificity caused by cross-reactivity may lead to over-estimates of the number of malaria cases and over-use of antimalarial drugs, at the cost of not diagnosing and treating the true underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the WHO Malaria RDT Product Testing Programme was analysed to assess FP rates of 221 RDTs against four infectious agents (Chagas, dengue, Leishmaniasis and Schistosomiasis) and four immunological factors (anti-nuclear antibody, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA), RF and rapid plasma regain). Only RDTs with a FP rate against clean negative samples less than 10% were included. Paired t-tests were used to compare product-specific FP rates on clean negative samples and samples containing non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Forty (18%) RDTs showed no FP results against any tested infectious agent or immunological factor. In the remaining RDTs significant and clinically relevant increases in FP rates were observed for samples containing HAMA and RF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were significant correlations between product-matched FP rates for RF and HAMA on all RDT test bands (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), and FP rates for each infectious agent and immunological factor were also correlated between test bands of combination RDTs (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;â¤0.002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;False positive results against non-&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; infectious agents and immunological factors does not appear to be a universal property of malaria RDTs. However, since many malaria RDTs have elevated FP rates against HAMA and RF positive samples practitioners may need to consider the possibility of false positive results for malaria in patients with conditions that stimulate HAMA or RF.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>989bb534</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197395</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd9:2835af05</id><author><name>Michelle L.

Results are provided both in a graphical interface and as downloadable files.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Compositional_Inhomogeneity_and_Tuneable_Thermal_Expansion_in_Mixed-Metal_ZIF-8_Analogues/6355802</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><title>Compositional Inhomogeneity and Tuneable Thermal Expansion in Mixed-Metal ZIF-8 Analogues</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Compositional_Inhomogeneity_and_Tuneable_Thermal_Expansion_in_Mixed-Metal_ZIF-8_Analogues/6355802</originId><summary><content>We study the structural and thermomechanical effectsof cation substitution in the compositional family ofmetalâorganic frameworks Zn1ôxCdx(mIm)2 (HmIm = 2-methylimidazole).

Optimization of DNA vaccine delivery improves the potency of the immune response and is crucial to clinical success. Here, we inquired how such optimization impacts the magnitude of the response, its specificity and type. BALB/c mice were DNA-immunized with two model immunogens, HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase by intramuscular or intradermal injections with electroporation. DNA immunogens were co-delivered with DNA encoding luciferase. Delivery and expression were monitored by in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). The endpoint immune responses were assessed by IFN-Î³/IL-2 FluoroSpot, multiparametric flow cytometry and antibody ELISA. Expression and immunogenicity were compared in relation to the delivery route. Regardless of the route, protease generated mainly IFN-Î³, and reverse transcriptase, IL-2 and antibody response. BLI of mice immunized with protease- or reverse transcriptase/reporter plasmid mixtures, demonstrated significant loss of luminescence over time. The rate of decline of luminescence strongly correlated with the magnitude of immunogen-specific response, and depended on the immunogenicity profile and the immunization route. In vitro and in vivo BLI-based assays demonstrated that intradermal delivery strongly improved the immunogenicity of protease, and to a lesser extent, of reverse transcriptase. Immune response polarization and epitope hierarchy were not affected. Thus, by changing delivery/immunogen expression sites, it is possible to modulate the magnitude, but not the type or fine specificity of the induced immune response.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>ba31eecb</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197902</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b779:3dd877af</id><author><name>Stefan Petkov</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Petkov, Elizaveta Starodubova, Anastasia Latanova, Athina KilpelÃ¤inen, Oleg Latyshev, Simons Svirskis, Britta Wahren, Francesca Chiodi, Ilya Gordeychuk, Maria Isaguliants&lt;/p&gt;

A case study of neural degeneration data highlights the ability of the web server to identify differences between cell type distributions in healthy and diseased mice.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/0fHAShl1kDQ/acschembio.8b00080</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] A Symmetric Molecule Produced by Mycobacteria Generates Cell-Length Asymmetry during Cell-Division and Thereby Cell-Length Heterogeneity</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00080/20180518/images/medium/cb-2018-00080q_0005.gif</url><height>433</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00080</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00080</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00080/20180518/images/medium/cb-2018-00080q_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00080&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal propagule bank could facilitate the regeneration and plantation of seedlings in disturbed area. In this study, Masson pine (&lt;i&gt;Pinus massoniana&lt;/i&gt;) seedlings were used to bait the ECM fungal propagule bank buried in the soils collected from a manganese (Mn) mine wasteland and a non-polluted area in China. After 6-month growth, we found the seedlings grown in the Mn mine soil (Mn:3200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) did not display any toxicity symptoms. Based on morphotyping and ITS-PCR sequencing, we identified a total of 16 ECM fungal OTUs (operative taxonomic units) at 97% similarity threshold, among which 11 OTUs were recovered in the Mn mine soils and 14 in the non-polluted soil. Two soil types shared 9 OTUs and both of them were dominated by a &lt;i&gt;Tylospora&lt;/i&gt; sp. Based on those soil propagule banks in Masson pine forests reported in previous, we speculated that some Atheliaceae species may be preferred in the soil propagule bank of some pine species, such as Masson pine. In addition, NMDS ordination displayed geographical position effects on soil propagule banks in five Masson pine forest from three sites at regional scale. In conclusion, Masson pine ECM seedlings could grow well in the Mn wasteland as a suitable tree species used for reforestation application in Mn mineland, in addition, Mn pollution did not alter the dominant ECM fungal species in the soil propagule banks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>ecdf36ec</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198628</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd4:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jian Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jian Huang, Qisheng Han, Junjian Li&lt;/p&gt;

The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is located on presynaptic neurons, where it plays an essential role in limiting dopaminergic signaling by temporarily curtailing high neurotransmitter concentration through rapid re-uptake. Transport by hDAT is energized by transmembrane ionic gradients. Dysfunction of this transporter leads to disease states, such as Parkinsonâs disease, bipolar disorder or depression. It has been shown that hDAT and other members of the monoamine transporter family exist in oligomeric forms at the plasma membrane. Several residues are known to be involved in oligomerization, but interaction interfaces, oligomer orientation and the quarternary arrangement in the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. Here we examine oligomeric forms of hDAT using a direct approach, by following dimerization of two randomly-oriented hDAT transporters in 512 independent simulations, each being 2 Î¼s in length. We employed the DAFT (docking assay for transmembrane components) approach, which is an unbiased molecular dynamics simulation method to identify oligomers, their conformations and populations. The overall ensemble of a total of &gt;1 ms simulation time revealed a limited number of symmetric and asymmetric dimers. The identified dimer interfaces include all residues known to be involved in dimerization. Importantly, we find that the surface of the bundle domain is largely excluded from engaging in dimeric interfaces. Such an interaction would typically lead to inhibition by stabilization of one conformation, while substrate transport relies on a large scale rotation between the inward-facing and the outward-facing state.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkmGr5vNPfk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>75cadd82</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006229</link><crawled>1528307826116</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d63ebdc4:1bc492e:a96d255</id><author><name>Kumaresan Jayaraman</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kumaresan Jayaraman, Alex N.

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, âselfâ protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of âselfâ antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>87853ac7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197472</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ba:2835af05</id><author><name>Daniela Frasca</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects. The unbinned likelihood methods used by Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; (2015) did not suffer from this problem.While a binned analysis might be favorable for simplicity and clarity of presentation, unbinned likelihood methods are preferable when effects might be somewhat subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>1c8d32d3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196863</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed4:2835af05</id><author><name>Sherry Towers</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherry Towers, Anuj Mubayi, Carlos Castillo-Chavez&lt;/p&gt;

We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects. The unbinned likelihood methods used by Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; (2015) did not suffer from this problem.While a binned analysis might be favorable for simplicity and clarity of presentation, unbinned likelihood methods are preferable when effects might be somewhat subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Ecology</item></keywords><title>Comment on &quot;Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale&quot;</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/eaar4685.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/eaar4685?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;LaManna &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;.

The theoretical spectra are in nearly quantitative agreement with the available experimental data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/brCdFezzLBI/s41598-018-25542-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in C. elegans male ray neurons</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>656</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25542-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25542_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25542-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/brCdFezzLBI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525762800000</published><fingerprint>99aa693f</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1</link><crawled>1525770957557</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1633f0932f5:133cbe:2835af05</id><author><name>Hu Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &amp;lt;i&gt;C&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;elegans&amp;lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25542-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25542-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;OSM-9 and an amiloride-sensitive channel, but not PKD-2, are involved in mechanosensation in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; male ray neurons&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/brCdFezzLBI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Development of Convolutional Neural Network Based Instance Segmentation Algorithm to Acquire Quantitative Criteria of Mouse Development [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/324186</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Multicellular organisms develop from the fertilized eggs through numbers of cell divisions.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples).

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples). The Chilean &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. parsimony network displayed 1 main haplotype. Additional studies using isolates from many locations across Chile and different intermediate hosts will provide more data on the molecular structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;. within this region. Likewise, investigations of the importance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; in human infection in Chile deserve future attention.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05346-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Mirror</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05346-z/d41586-018-05346-z_15819448.jpg</url><height>512</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05346-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mirror&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirror, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05346-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05346-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reflected glory.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>8</engagement><published>1528268400000</published><fingerprint>5d03616f</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05346-z</link><crawled>1528286905253</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163d4ff83a5:5cd149b:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Taik Hobson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mirror&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirror, Published online: 06 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05346-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05346-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Reflected glory.</description><engagementRate>0.11</engagementRate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319889v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>On the Biological Signalling, Information and Estimation Limits of Birth Processes [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/13/319889</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319889v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Cellular signalling involves networks of small, interacting molecular populations and requires precise event timing, despite the presence of noise.

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode. We found that the plant parasitic nematode &lt;i&gt;Bursaphelenchus xylophilus&lt;/i&gt; can survive more than 14 days under anoxic conditions.

Low temperature at the seedling stage is a major damaging factor for rice production in southern China. To better understand the cold response of cultivated and wild rice, cold-sensitive cultivar 93â11 (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. ssp. &lt;i&gt;Indica&lt;/i&gt;) and cold-resistant hybrid wild rice DC907 with a 93â11 genetic background were used for a quantitative proteomic analysis with tandem mass tags (TMT) in parallel. Rice seedlings grown for four weeks at a normal temperature (25Â°C) were treated at 8â10Â°C for 24, 72 and 120 h. The number of differentially expressed proteins increased gradually over time in the cold-exposed rice in comparison with the untreated rice. A total of 366 unique proteins involved in ATP synthesis, photosystem, reactive oxygen species, stress response, cell growth and integrity were identified as responding to cold stress in DC907. While both DC907 and 93â11 underwent similar alterations in proteomic profiles in response to cold stress, DC907 responded in a prompter manner in terms of expressing cold-responding proteins, maintained a higher level of photosynthesis to power the cells, and possessed a stable and higher level of DIR proteins to prevent the plant from obtaining irreversible cell structure damage. The observations made in this study may lay a new foundation for further investigation of cold sensitivity or tolerance mechanisms in rice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>2d2eaa99</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198675</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683357:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jinzi Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinzi Wang, Jun Wang, Xin Wang, Rongbai Li, Baoshan Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Some recent functionals however are found to be prone to catastrophic failure (possibly as a consequence of overparameterization), indicating a need for caution in applying these.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Pollen analysis of Australian honey</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Pollen analysis is widely used to verify the geographic origin of honeys, but has never been employed in Australia. In this study, we analysed the pollen content of 173 unblended honey samples sourced from most of the commercial honey producing regions in southern Australia. Southern Australian vegetation is dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; (Myrtaceae) forests and, as expected, most Australian honeys are palynologically dominated by &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt;, while other important components include Myrtaceae taxa such as &lt;i&gt;Corymbia&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Angophora&lt;/i&gt; and the tribe Leptospermeae; plus Brassicaceae, &lt;i&gt;Echium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Macadamia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia&lt;/i&gt;. An important feature of the honeys is the number of Myrtaceae pollen morphotypes per sample, which is generally high (mean = 4.6) compared to honeys produced outside of Australia, including &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys produced in the Mediterranean region, and honeys produced in South America, which has its own rich indigenous Myrtaceae flora. In the latter regions, the number of Myrtaceae morphotypes is apparently generally â¤2. A high number of Myrtaceae morphotypes may be a feasible criterion for authenticating the origin of Australian honeys, since most Australian honey is produced by honey bees mainly working indigenous floral resources. Myrtaceae morphotype diversity is a convenient melissopalynological measure that could be applied even where detailed knowledge of the pollen morphology of the many component genera and species is absent. Palynological criteria developed in Europe for authenticating &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/i&gt; honeys should not be relied upon for Australian honeys, since those criteria are not based on samples of Australian honey.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>2af529db</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197545</link><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c59:3dd877af</id><author><name>J.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering âyesâ to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>17541322</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197344</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b82:93d646dc</id><author><name>Eli Skeie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42Â±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2Â±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95Â±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90Â±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92Â±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy. This score can be used to target early intensification of nutritional and dietetic follow-up to the predicted high-risk population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>b4797223</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197248</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219c:93d646dc</id><author><name>Cosmin Sebastian Voican</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cosmin Sebastian Voican, Amandine Lebrun, Sophie Maitre, Panagiotis Lainas, Karima Lamouri, Micheline Njike-Nakseu, Martin Gaillard, Hadrien Tranchart, Axel Balian, Ibrahim Dagher, Gabriel Perlemuter, Sylvie Naveau&lt;/p&gt;

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>9</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>dd03e042</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</link><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3a:abeb7260</id><author><name>Jonathan E.

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>e5431d78</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197847</link><crawled>1526580013334</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f426916:4a23bbb:3dd877af</id><author><name>EugÃ©nie Cateau</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by EugÃ©nie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, HervÃ© Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

Human alveolar macrophages (HAM) are primary bacterial niche and immune response cells during &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb)&lt;/i&gt; infection, and human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are a model for investigating &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;-macrophage interactions. Here, we use a targeted RNA-Seq method to measure transcriptome-wide changes in RNA expression patterns of freshly obtained HAM (used within 6 h) and 6 day cultured MDM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection over time (2, 24 and 72 h), in both uninfected and infected cells from three donors each. The Ion AmpliSeqâ¢ Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit (AmpliSeq) uses primers targeting 18,574 mRNAs and 2,228 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for a total of 20,802 transcripts. AmpliSeq&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; yields highly precise and reproducible gene expression profiles (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;0.99). Taking advantage of AmpliSeqâs reproducibility, we establish well-defined quantitative RNA expression patterns of HAM &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; MDM, including significant &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb-&lt;/i&gt;inducible genes, in networks and pathways that differ in part between MDM and HAM. A similar number of expressed genes are detected at all time-points between uninfected MDM and HAM, in common pathways including inflammatory and immune functions, but canonical pathway differences also exist. In particular, at 2 h, multiple genes relevant to the immune response are preferentially expressed in either uninfected HAM or MDM, while the HAM RNA profiles approximate MDM profiles over time in culture, highlighting the unique RNA expression profile of freshly obtained HAM. MDM demonstrate a greater transcriptional response than HAM upon &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; infection, with 2 to &gt;10 times more genes up- or down-regulated. The results identify key genes involved in cellular responses to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt; in two different human macrophage types. Follow-up bioinformatics analysis indicates that approximately 30% of response genes have expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs in GTEx), common DNA variants that can influence host gene expression susceptibility or resistance to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;tb&lt;/i&gt;, illustrated with the &lt;i&gt;TREM1&lt;/i&gt; gene cluster and &lt;i&gt;IL-10&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>3bc35416</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198221</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb925:3dd877af</id><author><name>Audrey C.

General practice has an important role within the Australian healthcare system to provide access to care and effective management of chronic health conditions. However, people with serious mental illness experience challenges associated with service access.

General practice has an important role within the Australian healthcare system to provide access to care and effective management of chronic health conditions. However, people with serious mental illness experience challenges associated with service access. The current paper seeks to examine drivers of access to general practice for people with common and serious mental disorders, compared with people who access care for type II diabetes, a common physical health problem managed in general practice. The Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) programme provides the most comprehensive and objective measurement of general practitioner activity in Australia. Using BEACH data, this study compared general practice encounters for depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and type II diabetes during a 10-year period between 2006 and 2016. Analysis revealed more frequent encounters for depression compared to anxiety, and a higher representation of women in encounters for bipolar disorder compared to men. The relationship between number of encounters and patient age was strongly associated with the life course and mortality characteristics associated with each disorder. The findings highlight specific challenges associated with access to primary care for people with serious mental illness, and suggest areas of focus to improve the ability of these patients to access and navigate the health system.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198836</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Overproduction of the cyanobacterial hydrogenase and selection of a mutant thriving on urea, as a possible step towards the future production of hydrogen coupled with water treatment</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198836</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198836</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by ThÃ©o Veaudor, Marcia Ortega-Ramos, Thichakorn Jittawuttipoka, HervÃ© Bottin, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat, Franck Chauvat&lt;/p&gt;
Using a combination of various types of genetic manipulations (promoter replacement and gene cloning in replicating plasmid expression vector), we have overproduced the complex hydrogenase enzyme in the model cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; PCC6803. This new strain overproduces all twelve following proteins: HoxEFUYH (hydrogen production), HoxW (maturation of the HoxH subunit of hydrogenase) and HypABCDEF (assembly of the [NiFe] redox center of HoxHY hydrogenase). This strain when grown in the presence of a suitable quantities of nickel and iron used here exhibits a strong (25-fold) increase in hydrogenase activity, as compared to the WT strain growing in the standard medium. Hence, this strain can be very useful for future analyses of the cyanobacterial [NiFe] hydrogenase to determine its structure and, in turn, improve its tolerance to oxygen with the future goal of increasing hydrogen production. We also report the counterintuitive notion that lowering the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; urease can increase the photoproduction of biomass from urea-polluted waters, without decreasing hydrogenase activity. Such cyanobacterial factories with high hydrogenase activity and a healthy growth on urea constitute an important step towards the future development of an economical industrial processes coupling H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from solar energy and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with wastewater treatment (urea depollution).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>c3ab4786</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198836</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b31c:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>ThÃ©o Veaudor</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by ThÃ©o Veaudor, Marcia Ortega-Ramos, Thichakorn Jittawuttipoka, HervÃ© Bottin, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat, Franck Chauvat&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial blight (BB) in rice caused by &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas oryzae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;oryzae&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt;) is a major global production constraint, particularly in irrigated and rain-fed lowland areas. Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM) is an elite, high-yielding, fine-grain type, BB-resistant rice variety possessing three BB-resistant genes (&lt;i&gt;Xa21&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;xa13&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;xa5&lt;/i&gt;) and is highly popular in the southern parts of India. As the BB pathogen is highly dynamic and the evolution of pathogen virulence against the deployed resistance genes is common, we added a novel BB-resistant gene, &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, into ISM through marker-assisted backcross breeding (MABB) to increase the spectrum and durability of BB resistance. The breeding line PR 114 (Xa38) was used as the donor for &lt;i&gt;Xa38&lt;/i&gt;, whereas ISM was used as the recurrent parent. Foreground selection was conducted using PCR-based gene-specific markers for the target genes, whereas background selection was conducted using a set of polymorphic SSR markers between the parents and backcrossing that continued until the third generation. Eighteen homozygous BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plants possessing all four BB-resistant genes in the homozygous state and with a recurrent parent genome (RPG) recovery of more than 92% were identified and advanced to the BC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; generation. These 18 backcross-derived lines (BDLs) exhibited very high level of resistance against multiple &lt;i&gt;Xoo&lt;/i&gt; strains and displayed agro-morphological traits, grain qualities and yield levels similar to or better than those of the recurrent parent ISM.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>5a870694</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198260</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Arra Yugander</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arra Yugander, Raman M.

&lt;i&gt;Trichinella spiralis&lt;/i&gt; mainly dwells in the muscle tissue of its host and is the main causative agent of trichinellosis in humans.

Of the 1,476 proteins detected in the ML, 121 proteins showed differential expression, including 50 significantly upregulated and 71 downregulated proteins. The functions of the 108 annotated proteins were primarily related to signal transduction, transcription/translation, material metabolism, protein synthesis/assembly/degradation, and stress/defense/antioxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay verified that FRMD5 and CUT-1 gene expression levels were significantly increased, while COX2 gene expression level was significantly decreased. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the majority of differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in the molecular function of the catalytic activity, biological process of the immune system process, metabolic process, cellular component organization, biological adhesion, and cellular component of the macromolecular complex.

Glial cells perform numerous functions to support neuron development and function, including axon wrapping, formation of the blood brain barrier, and enhancement of synaptic transmission. We have identified a novel gene, &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt;, which functions in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Reducing Raw levels in glia results in morphological defects in the brain and ventral nerve cord, as well as defects in neuron function, as revealed by decreased locomotion in crawling assays. Examination of the number of glia along peripheral nerves reveals a reduction in glial number upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. The reduced number of glia along peripheral nerves occurs as a result of decreased glial proliferation. As Raw has been shown to negatively regulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in other developmental contexts, we examined the expression of a JNK reporter and the downstream JNK target, &lt;i&gt;matrix metalloproteinase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mmp1&lt;/i&gt;), and found that &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown results in increased reporter activity and Mmp1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies showing increased Mmp levels lead to nerve cord defects similar to those observed upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. In addition, knockdown of &lt;i&gt;puckered&lt;/i&gt;, a negative feedback regulator of JNK signaling, also causes a decrease in glial number. Thus, our studies have resulted in the identification of a new regulator of gliogenesis, and demonstrate that increased JNK signaling negatively impacts glial development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>60</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>8f758c8c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198161</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c25:3dd877af</id><author><name>Diana Luong</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Luong, Luselena Perez, Jennifer C.

As data for microbial community structures found in various environments has increased, studies have examined the relationship between environmental labels given to retrieved microbial samples and their community structures. However, because environments continuously change over time and space, mixed states of some environments and its effects on community formation should be considered, instead of evaluating effects of discrete environmental categories. Here we applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to paired datasets containing more than 30,000 samples of microbial community structures and sample description documents. From the training results, we extracted latent environmental topics that associate co-occurring microbes with co-occurring word sets among samples. Topics are the core elements of environmental mixtures and the visualization of topic-based samples clarifies the connections of various environments. Based on the model training results, we developed a web application, LEA (Latent Environment Allocation), which provides the way to evaluate typicality and heterogeneity of microbial communities in newly obtained samples without confining environmental categories to be compared. Because topics link words and microbes, LEA also enables to search samples semantically related to the query out of 30,000 microbiome samples.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o92_2kUTykI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>4f920099</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006143</link><crawled>1528307826116</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163d63ebdc4:1bc492c:a96d255</id><author><name>Koichi Higashi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Koichi Higashi, Shinya Suzuki, Shin Kurosawa, Hiroshi Mori, Ken Kurokawa&lt;/p&gt;

Because topics link words and microbes, LEA also enables to search samples semantically related to the query out of 30,000 microbiome samples.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o92_2kUTykI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Phenotypic characterization of aberrant stem and progenitor cell populations in myelodysplastic syndromes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin N.

Recent reports have revealed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to arise from cancer stem cells phenotypically similar to physiological hematopoietic stem cells. Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis maintains a hierarchical organization, but the proportion of several hematopoietic compartments is skewed and multiple surface markers are aberrantly expressed. These aberrant antigen expression patterns hold diagnostic and therapeutic promise. However, eradication of MDS requires targeting of early myelodysplasia propagating stem cells. This warrants an exact assessment of the differentiation stage at which aberrant expression occurs in transformed hematopoiesis. Here, we report results on the prospective and extensive dissection of the hematopoietic hierarchy in 20 patients with either low-risk MDS or MDS with excess blasts and compare it to hematopoiesis in patients with non-malignancy-associated cytopenia or B cell lymphoma without bone marrow infiltration. We found patients with MDS with excess blasts to exhibit characteristic expansions of specific immature progenitor compartments. We also identified the aberrant expression of several markers including ALDH, CLL-1, CD44, and CD47 to be specific features of hematopoiesis in MDS with excess blasts. We show that amongst these, aberrant CLL-1 expression manifested at the early uncommitted hematopoietic stem cell level, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic target.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>a5bc00f0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197823</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd77:3dd877af</id><author><name>Benjamin N.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) has become the tool of choice for genome editing. Despite the fact that it has evolved as a highly efficient means to edit/replace coding sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency for âcleanâ editing of non-coding DNA remains low. We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>3</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>584e3b44</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b795:3dd877af</id><author><name>George Stratigopoulos</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory. Implications for industry and education are considered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>c47ec2bf</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197810</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406e:2835af05</id><author><name>Victor Swift</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Swift, Jordan B.

TF knockdown experiments have revealed correlations between TF binding profiles and gene expression levels. We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features. Methods: Genes with correlated expression patterns across 53 tissues were identified according to their Bray-Curtis similarity. DNase I-accessible promoter intervals of direct TF target genes were scanned with previously derived information theory-based position weight matrices (iPWMs) of 82 TFs. Features from information density-based TFBS clusters were used to predict target genes with machine learning classifiers. The accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of the classifiers were determined for different feature sets. Mutations in TFBSs were also introduced to in silico examine their impact on cluster densities and the regulatory states of target genes. Results: We initially chose the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1), whose regulation has been extensively studied, to test this approach. SLC25A32 and TANK were found to exhibit the most similar expression patterns to this gene across 53 tissues. A Decision Tree classifier exhibited the largest area (0.9987 and 0.9956 respectively before and after eliminating inaccessible promoter intervals based on DNase I HyperSensitive Regions (DHSs)) under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in detecting such coordinately regulated genes. Target gene prediction was confirmed using siRNA knockdown data of TFs, which was more accurate than CRISPR inactivation. In-silico mutation analyses of TFBSs also revealed that one or more information-dense TFBS clusters in promoters are required for accurate target gene prediction. Conclusions: Machine learning based on TFBS information density, organization, and chromatin accessibility accurately identifies gene targets with comparable tissue-wide expression patterns.

In nonadherent conditions, GSCs display...</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/7qsuWFP49Fc/acschembio.8b00154</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/acbcct</streamId><title>ACS Chemical Biology: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Selective Inhibition of the Myeloid Src-Family Kinase Fgr Potently Suppresses AML Cell Growth in Vitro and in Vivo</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00154/20180530/images/medium/cb-2018-00154h_0006.gif</url><height>263</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00154</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.8b00154</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/acbcct/0/acbcct.ahead-of-print/acschembio.8b00154/20180530/images/medium/cb-2018-00154h_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;ACS Chemical Biology&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00154&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several studies have shown that long-term survival after acute kidney injury (AKI) is reduced even if there is clinical recovery. However, we recently reported that in septic shock patients those that recover from AKI have survival similar to patients without AKI. Here, we studied a cohort with less severe sepsis to examine the effects of AKI on longer-term survival as a function of recovery by discharge.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed patients with community-acquired pneumonia from the Genetic and Inflammatory Markers of Sepsis (GenIMS) cohort. We included patients who developed AKI (KDIGO stages 2â3) and defined renal recovery as alive at hospital discharge with return of SCr to within 150% of baseline without dialysis. Our primary outcome was survival up to 3 years analyzed using Grayâs model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1742 patients who survived to hospital discharge, stage 2â3 AKI occurred in 262 (15%), of which 111 (42.4%) recovered. Compared to recovered patients, patients without recovery were older (75 Â±14 vs 69 Â±15 years, p&amp;lt;0.001) and were more likely to have at least stage 1 AKI on day 1 (83% vs 52%, p&amp;lt;0.001). Overall, 445 patients (25.5%) died during follow-up, 23.4% (347/1480) for no AKI, 28% (31/111) for AKI with recovery and 44.3% (67/151) for AKI without recovery. Patients who did not recover had worse survival compared to no AKI (HR range 1.05â2.46, p = 0.01), while recovering patients had similar survival compared to no AKI (HR 1.01, 95%CI 0.69â1.47, p = 0.96). Absence of AKI on day 1, no in-hospital renal replacement therapy (RRT), higher Apache III score and higher baseline SCr were associated with recovery after AKI.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In patients with sepsis, recovery by hospital discharge is associated with long-term survival similar to patients without AKI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>96bb3d7f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198269</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc8:3dd877af</id><author><name>Marco Fiorentino</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marco Fiorentino, Fadi A.

Altogether, our studies suggest that the multi-chambered atrium in amniotes arose from a molecular blueprint present before the evolutionary emergence of cardiac septation and provide insights into the establishment of atrial asymmetry.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32833</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/5016.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Lifetime of muscarinic receptor-G-protein complexes determines coupling efficiency and G-protein subtype selectivity [Pharmacology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/5016</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/5016.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>G-proteinâcoupled receptors (GPCRs) are essential for the detection of extracellular stimuli by cells and transfer the encoded information via the activation of functionally distinct subsets of heterotrimeric G proteins into intracellular signals.

Diminishing the cost of broiler chicken diet is a critical issue in the poultry industry. Numerous studies were performed to achieve this pivotal objective by diet supplementation with alternative feed additives. In the current study, low-energy broiler rations were supplemented with different commercial multienzyme formulations to minimize the cost, and increase the digestibility and absorption of the digested macronutrients. Cobb Avian 48 broiler chicks (mixed sex, 1-d-old, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3120) were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was subdivided into four replicates (130 birds per replicate). The birds were randomly allocated into a control group fed basal diet (CB); control group fed low-energy diet (CL); and birds fed low-energy diets supplemented with different enzyme formulations. The enzyme formulations used were Xylam 500&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLX group), Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLH group), Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLA group), and Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLM group,) following the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The growth performance of CLA and CLH group birds was significantly improved when compared with CL. In comparison with CB, Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) increased the intestinal &lt;i&gt;PEPT1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; expression; PEPT1 facilitates the absorption of micronutrients. In conclusion, exogenous multienzyme complexes may be included in the low-energy diet to enhance the performance of broiler chickens (Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; Ë Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt; Ë Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;Â®&lt;/sup&gt;), and reduce the diet cost by up-regulating the expression of intestinal nutrient transporter genes, and improving the immunity and serum biochemical parameters of broiler chickens.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>2e3c15e3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198085</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb91e:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ahmed A.

Ischemic stroke remains an important cause of disability and mortality. Hypertension is a critical risk factor for the development of ischemic stroke. Control of risk factors, including hypertension, is therefore important for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Linalyl acetate (LA) has been reported to have therapeutic effects in ischemic stroke by modulating intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and having anti-oxidative properties. The preventive efficacy of LA has not yet been determined. This study therefore investigated the preventive efficacy of LA in rat aortas exposed to hypertension related-ischemic injury, and the mechanism of action of LA.Hypertension was induced &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; following ischemic injury to the aorta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Effects of LA were assayed by western blotting, by determining concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and by vascular contractility assays. LA significantly reduced systolic blood pressure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, LA suppressed ischemic injury-induced expression of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit p47&lt;sup&gt;phox&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as ROS production, LDH release, and ROS-induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase suppression. These findings indicate that LA has anti-hypertensive properties that can prevent hypertension-related ischemic injury and can prevent NADPH oxidase-induced production of ROS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>5334af14</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198082</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd84:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yu Shan Hsieh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Shan Hsieh, Soonho Kwon, Hui Su Lee, Geun Hee Seol&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Young breast cancer survivors in Mexico face distinct psychosocial challenges that have not been characterized. This study aims to describe the psychosocial needs of young breast cancer survivors in Mexico at 5 or more years of survivorship, identifying areas of focus for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer patients diagnosed at age 40 or prior with 5 or more years since diagnosis were invited to participate in one-on-one 30â60 minute semi-structured audio-recorded interviews at the Instituto Nacional de CancerologÃ­a in Mexico City. Transcripts were coded using thematic analysis with NVivo software.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;25 women participated. Five major phenomena emerged from analysis: (1) minimization of fertility concerns; (2) persistence of body image disturbance over time; (3) barriers to employment during survivorship; (4) impact on family relationships and social networks; &amp;amp; (5) unmet psychological care and informational needs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Early interventions with a focus on fertility loss education, access to reconstructive surgery and body image support, guidance during return-to-work, assistance with childcare, integration of psychological care and the fulfillment of informational needs could ameliorate long-term psychological and social distress for young breast cancer survivors in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>39680e66</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197931</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:7094076:2835af05</id><author><name>Harper G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behaviors adversely affect the health of youth and young adults exposing them to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS and unwanted pregnancy to females that in turn lead to deleterious health, social and economic consequences. Youth centers inform their clients on sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, high risk abortion, and other reproductive health problems. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the prevalence of risky sexual behaviors among youth center reproductive health clinic users and non-users in Addis Ababa.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A comparative cross-sectional study design was carried out among 524 youth in Addis Ababa from March to April, 2016. The data was entered in EPI-INFO 7 software; and cleaned and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. The prevalence was computed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression was done to determine the strength, direction and significance of association between youth center reproductive health clinic utilization and risky sexual behavior and to control confounder variables respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 524 youth with the response rate of 92% participated in the study. The overall prevalence of risky sexual behavior was 226 (43.1%) (With statistically significant difference in prevalence among users 101 (38.5%) and non-users 125 (47.7%) of youth center clinics, (p-value = 0.04). The odds of reporting risky sexual behavior was 60% higher among volunteers who did not use the reproductive health clinic, relative to those who did (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI = 1.08, 2.37). Teenagers aged 15â19 years were (AOR = 0.08; 95%CI = 0.05, 0.15) 92% less likely to practice risky sexual behavior compared to those aged 25â29 years old.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Risky sexual behavior was statistically significantly higher among non-users of the youth center reproductive health clinic compared with the users. In addition, a substantial proportion of the youth engaged in different risky sexual behaviors that are evidenced by the existence of multiple sexual partners, sexual practice without condom and early sexual debut that might predispose youth to STIs including HIV infection and unwanted pregnancy.

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;triticina&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers &lt;i&gt;usw215&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usw218&lt;/i&gt; were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while &lt;i&gt;usw260&lt;/i&gt; was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>e04f2727</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197317</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0eb:2835af05</id><author><name>Dhouha Kthiri</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dhouha Kthiri, Alexander Loladze, P.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion. Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>504f9ef5</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197077</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506a:2835af05</id><author><name>Robert van Woesik</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Robert van Woesik, Christopher William Cacciapaglia&lt;/p&gt;

Such rates of vertical accretion are higher than projected averages of sea-level rise for the representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate-change scenarios 2.6, 4.5, and 6, but lower than for the RCP scenario 8.5.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334771v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Semi-supervised Encoding for Outlier Detection in Clinical Observation Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/334771</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334771v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Background and Objective: To evaluate the utility of encoding for outlier detection in clinical observation data from Electronic Health Records (EHR).

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050â1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045â1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>de986340</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197402</link><crawled>1526057643441</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ef:2835af05</id><author><name>De Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

The role of the subthalamic nucleus in human locomotion is unclear although relevant, given the troublesome management of gait disturbances with subthalamic deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinsonâs disease. We investigated the subthalamic activity and inter-hemispheric connectivity during walking in eight freely-moving subjects with Parkinsonâs disease and bilateral deep brain stimulation. In particular, we compared the subthalamic power spectral densities and coherence, amplitude cross-correlation and phase locking value between resting state, upright standing, and steady forward walking. We observed a phase locking value drop in the &lt;i&gt;Î²-&lt;/i&gt;frequency band (â13-35Hz) during walking with respect to resting and standing. This modulation was not accompanied by specific changes in subthalamic power spectral densities, which was not related to gait phases or to striatal dopamine loss measured with [&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]N-Ï-fluoropropyl-2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane and single-photon computed tomography. We speculate that the subthalamic inter-hemispheric desynchronization in the &lt;i&gt;Î²-&lt;/i&gt;frequency band reflects the information processing of each body side separately, which may support linear walking. This study also suggests that in some cases (i.e. gait) the brain signal, which could allow feedback-controlled stimulation, might derive from network activity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>12d70d20</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198691</link><crawled>1528384685390</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163dad3854e:658f439:3dd877af</id><author><name>Gabriele Arnulfo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriele Arnulfo, NicolÃ² Gabriele Pozzi, Chiara Palmisano, Alice Leporini, Andrea Canessa, Joachim Brumberg, Gianni Pezzoli, Cordula Matthies, Jens Volkmann, Ioannis Ugo Isaias&lt;/p&gt;

Leopard seals are an important Antarctic apex predator that can affect marine ecosystems through local predation. Here we report on the successful use of micro geolocation logging sensor tags to track the movements, and activity, of four leopard seals for trips of between 142â446 days including one individual in two separate years. Whilst the sample size is small the results represent an advance in our limited knowledge of leopard seals. We show the longest periods of tracking of leopard sealsâ migratory behaviour between the pack ice, close to the Antarctic continent, and the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. It appears that these tracked animals migrate in a directed manner towards Bird Island and, during their residency, use this as a central place for foraging trips as well as exploiting the local penguin and seal populations. Movements to the South Orkney Islands were also recorded, similar to those observed in other predators in the region including the krill fishery. Analysis of habitat associations, taking into account location errors, indicated the tracked seals had an affinity for shallow shelf water and regions of sea ice. Wet and dry sensors revealed that seals hauled out for between 22 and 31% of the time with maximum of 74 hours and a median of between 9 and 11 hours. The longest period a seal remained in the water was between 13 and 25 days. Fitting GAMMs showed that haul out rates changed throughout the year with the highest values occurring during the summer which has implications for visual surveys. Peak haul out occurred around midday for the months between October and April but was more evenly spread across the day between May and September. The sealsâ movements between, and behaviour within, areas important to breeding populations of birds and other seals, coupled with the dynamics of the regionâs fisheries, shows an understanding of leopard seal ecology is vital in the management of the Southern Ocean resources.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>43224b4d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197767</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bbc:3dd877af</id><author><name>Iain J.

Stressor-exposure has been shown to exacerbate inflammation and change the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota; however stressor-induced effects on microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors are unknown. Thus, bacterial-produced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as microbial community composition, were assessed in the colons of mice exposed to stress during infection with &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter rodentium&lt;/i&gt;. Mice were exposed to overnight restraint on 7 consecutive nights, or left undisturbed as a control. After the first exposure of restraint, mice were orally challenged with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt; or with vehicle. Microbial community composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and SCFA levels measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Pathogen levels and colonic inflammation were also assessed 6 days post-infection. Results demonstrated that the microbial community structure and SCFA production were significantly affected by both stressor exposure and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;rodentium&lt;/i&gt;-infection. Exposure to prolonged restraint in the absence of infection significantly reduced SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid). Multiple bacterial taxa were affected by stressor exposure, with the relative abundance of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; being significantly reduced and directly correlated with propionic acid. &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; abundances were inversely correlated with colonic inflammation, supporting the contention that &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; helps to regulate mucosal inflammatory responses.

Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) constitutes one of the most important food fish in Japan; accordingly, genome sequencing and linkage mapping have been conducted for the purpose of artificial cultivation. In the next stage, integration of genomic sequences within linkage groups (LG) is required to construct higher-resolution genetic markers for quantitative trait loci mapping and selective breeding of beneficial traits in farming. In order to identify LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly (323,776 scaffolds) reported previously, we attempted to isolate chromosomes corresponding to LG1 by flow sorting and subsequent analyses. Initially, single chromosomes were randomly collected by chromosome sorting and subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA). A total of 60 WGA samples were screened by PCR with primers for a known LG1-linked scaffold, and five positive WGA samples were sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Following reference mapping analysis of the NGS reads, four of the five WGA samples were found to be enriched by LG1-linked sequences. These samples were cytogenetically assigned to chromosome 5 by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization. Using blastn searches with 82,081 contigs constructed from the NGS reads of the four WGA samples as queries, 2323 scaffolds were identified as putative LG1-linked scaffolds from the draft genome assembly. The total length of the putative LG1-linked scaffolds was 99.0 Mb, comparable to the estimated DNA amounts of chromosome 5 (91.1 Mb). These results suggest that the methodology developed herein is applicable to isolate specific chromosome DNAs and integrate unanchored scaffold sequences onto a particular LG and chromosome even in teleost fishes, in which isolation of specific chromosomes by flow sorting is generally difficult owing to similar morphologies, sizes, and GC-contents among chromosomes in the genome. The putative LG1-linked scaffolds of Japanese eel contain a total of 6833 short tandem repeats which will be available for higher-resolution linkage mapping.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>cb53fc71</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197040</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475065:2835af05</id><author><name>Kazumi Matsubara</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazumi Matsubara, Yuki Iwasaki, Issei Nishiki, Kazuharu Nomura, Atushi Fujiwara&lt;/p&gt;

In long-term potentiation (LTP), one of the most studied types of neural plasticity, synaptic strength is persistently increased in response to stimulation. Although a number of different proteins have been implicated in the sub-cellular molecular processes underlying induction and maintenance of LTP, the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A particular challenge is to demonstrate that a proposed molecular mechanism can provide the level of stability needed to maintain memories for months or longer, in spite of the fact that many of the participating molecules have much shorter life spans. Here we present a computational model that combines simulations of several biochemical reactions that have been suggested in the LTP literature and show that the resulting system does exhibit the required stability. At the core of the model are two interlinked feedback loops of molecular reactions, one involving the atypical protein kinase PKMÎ¶ and its messenger RNA, the other involving PKMÎ¶ and GluA2-containing AMPA receptors. We demonstrate that robust bistabilityâstable equilibria both in the synapseâs potentiated and unpotentiated statesâcan arise from a set of simple molecular reactions. The model is able to account for a wide range of empirical results, including induction and maintenance of late-phase LTP, cellular memory reconsolidation and the effects of different pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_PVuKNJRBs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>2c540046</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006147</link><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df6:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Peter Helfer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Helfer, Thomas R.

However, relative scarcity and regional heterogeneity of brain gene expression and neuropathology datasets obscure the ability to robustly identify expression markers. We propose MD-AD (Multi-task Deep learning for AD) to effectively combine heterogeneous AD datasets by simultaneously modeling multiple phenotypes with shared layers. MD-AD leads to an 8% and 5% reduction in mean squared error over MLP for predicting counts of two AD hallmarks: plaques and tangles. It also leads to a 40% and 30% reduction in classification error over MLP for two common staging systems for AD: CERAD score and Braak stage. Additionally, MD-AD&apos;s network representation tends to better capture known metabolic pathways, including some known AD-related pathways.

We propose MD-AD (Multi-task Deep learning for AD) to effectively combine heterogeneous AD datasets by simultaneously modeling multiple phenotypes with shared layers. MD-AD leads to an 8% and 5% reduction in mean squared error over MLP for predicting counts of two AD hallmarks: plaques and tangles. It also leads to a 40% and 30% reduction in classification error over MLP for two common staging systems for AD: CERAD score and Braak stage. Additionally, MD-AD&apos;s network representation tends to better capture known metabolic pathways, including some known AD-related pathways. Together, these results indicate that MD-AD is particularly useful for learning expressive network representations from heterogeneous and sparsely labeled AD data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317941v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Network Enhancement: a general method to denoise weighted biological networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/09/317941</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/317941v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Networks are ubiquitous in biology where they encode connectivity patterns at all scales of organization, from molecular to the biome.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>47e98465</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><author><name>Viktorija Ilieva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05174-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Piecing together the puzzle of Huntingtonâs disease</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05174-1/d41586-018-05174-1_15778452.jpg</url><height>577</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05174-1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Piecing together the puzzle of Huntingtonâs disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piecing together the puzzle of Huntingtonâs disease, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05174-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05174-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Even as new treatments loom, researchers are still trying to understand what goes wrong inside the cells of people with the genetic disorder.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>18</engagement><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>7b98c426</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05174-1</link><crawled>1527677194324</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163b0a81054:2684368:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Sarah DeWeerdt</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Piecing together the puzzle of Huntingtonâs disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piecing together the puzzle of Huntingtonâs disease, Published online: 30 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05174-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05174-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Even as new treatments loom, researchers are still trying to understand what goes wrong inside the cells of people with the genetic disorder.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315903v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Prioritizing network communities [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/28/315903</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315903v2?rss=1</originId><content><content>Uncovering modular structure in networks is fundamental for systems in biology, physics, and engineering.

This study assessed agreement between radiation oncologist- and cancer patient-reported perceptions about cancer diagnosis, time since diagnosis, treatment purpose, and whether life expectancy had been discussed; and described preferences for prognosis discussions. Adult cancer patients receiving radiotherapy at a Japanese hospital were invited to complete a touchscreen tablet survey. Patient survey responses were linked and comparisons made with a survey completed by their radiation oncologist. Among 146 cancer patient-oncologist dyads, there was almost perfect agreement on cancer diagnosis (Ä¸ = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82â0.94), substantial agreement on time since diagnosis (Ä¸ = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.57â0.83) and moderate agreement on whether treatment goal was curative or palliative (Ä¸ = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28â0.57; all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;âs &amp;lt; 0.0001). Agreement about whether a life expectancy discussion had occurred was less than expected by chance (Îº = -0.06, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.9). Radiation oncologists reported that they had spoken to over two thirds of patients about this, whilst less than one third of patients stated that this discussion had occurred with their radiation oncologist. Over half of the patients who had not discussed life expectancy wanted to. Patients had variable preferences for whether they (80%), their radiation oncologist (78%) or their partner/family (52%) should decide whether they discuss their life expectancy. Although patient self-reported information about diagnosis and time since diagnosis appears to be reasonably accurate (compared with clinician-reported information), limitations of self-reported data about prognostic discussions were highlighted by poor agreement between patient- and clinician-reported information about whether prognostic discussions have occurred. Additional support is needed to improve prognosis communication and understanding in radiation oncology settings.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>a6b56a84</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198437</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0ac:2835af05</id><author><name>Lisa Jane Mackenzie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lisa Jane Mackenzie, Mariko Leanne Carey, Eiji Suzuki, Robert William Sanson-Fisher, Hiromi Asada, Masakazu Ogura, Catherine DâEste, Michio Yoshimura, Masakazu Toi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Sepsis is now operationally defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by an infection, identified by an acute change in SOFA-Score of at least two points, including clinical chemistry such as creatinine or bilirubin concentrations. However, little knowledge exists about organ-specific microRNAs as potentially new biomarkers. Accordingly, we tested the hypotheses that micro-RNA-122, the foremost liver-related micro-RNA (miR), 1) discriminates between sepsis and infection, 2) is an early predictor for mortality, and 3) improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-score.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed 108 patients with sepsis (infection + increase SOFA-Score â¥2) within the first 24h of ICU admission and as controls 20 patients with infections without sepsis (infection + SOFA-Score â¤1). Total circulating miR was isolated from serum and relative miR-122 expression was measured (using spiked-in cel-miR-54) and associated with 30-day survival.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;30-day survival of the sepsis patients was 63%. miR-122 expression was 40-fold higher in non-survivors (p = 0.001) and increased almost 6-fold in survivors (p = 0.013) compared to controls. miR-122 serum-expression discriminated both between sepsis vs. infection (AUC 0.760, sensitivity 58.3%, specificity 95%) and survivors vs. non-survivors (AUC 0.728, sensitivity 42.5%, specificity 94%). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed miR-122 (HR 4.3; 95%-CI 2.0â8.9, p&amp;lt;0.001) as independent prognostic factor for 30-day mortality. Furthermore, the predictive value for 30-day mortality of the SOFA-Score (AUC 0.668) was improved by adding miR-122 (AUC 0.743; net reclassification improvement 0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001; integrated discrimination improvement 0.07, p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Increased miR-122 serum concentration supports the discrimination between infection and sepsis, is an early and independent risk factor for 30-day mortality, and improves the prognostic value of the SOFA-Score, suggesting a potential role for miR-122 in sepsis-related prediction models.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>a80077c4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197637</link><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761235:93d646dc</id><author><name>Tim Rahmel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tim Rahmel, Simon T.

It is difficult to target and kill cancer cells. One possible approach is to mutate bacteria to enhance their binding to cancer cells. In the present study, Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; were randomly mutated, and then were positively and negatively selected for binding cancer vs normal cells. With repetitive mutation and selection both bacteria successfully evolved to increase affinity to the pancreatic cancer cell line (Mia PaCa-2) but not normal cells (HPDE: immortalized human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells). The mutant &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; strains bound to Mia PaCa-2 cells about 10 and 25 times more than to HPDE cells. The selected &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strain had mutations in biofilm-related genes and the regulatory region for a type I pilus gene. Consistent with type I pili involvement, mannose could inhibit the binding to cells. The results suggest that weak but specific binding is involved in the initial step of adhesion. To test their ability to kill Mia PaCa-2 cells, hemolysin was expressed in the mutant strain. The hemolysin released from the mutant strain was active and could kill Mia PaCa-2 cells. In the case of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the initial binding to the cells was a weak interaction of the leading pole of the motile bacteria. The frequency of this interaction to Mia PaCa-2 cells dramatically increased in the evolved mutant strain. This mutant strain could also specifically invade beneath Mia PaCa-2 cells and settle there. This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>6f343aa2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198157</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b944:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Masaki Osawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masaki Osawa&lt;/p&gt;

This type of mutation/selection strategy may be applicable to other combinations of cancer cells and bacterial species.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/TZXJzyLXw_o/s41598-018-25849-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in Îµ-Fe2O3/GaN (0001) epitaxial films</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25849-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25849_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>423</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25849-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25849-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &lt;i&gt;Îµ&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &amp;lt;i&gt;Îµ&amp;lt;/i&gt;-Fe&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;lt;sub&gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25849-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25849-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &lt;i&gt;Îµ&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/TZXJzyLXw_o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528354800000</published><fingerprint>55e5c849</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25849-z</link><crawled>1528363314198</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163d98d6c16:647411c:2835af05</id><author><name>Victor Ukleev</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &lt;i&gt;Îµ&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &amp;lt;i&gt;Îµ&amp;lt;/i&gt;-Fe&amp;lt;sub&gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;lt;sub&gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films, Published online: 07 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25849-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25849-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Unveiling structural, chemical and magnetic interfacial peculiarities in &lt;i&gt;Îµ&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/GaN (0001) epitaxial films&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/TZXJzyLXw_o&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4532.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Cognitive underpinnings of nationalistic ideology in the context of Brexit [Psychological and Cognitive Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4532</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/19.cover-source.jpg?itok=gY78Iz1p</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>False</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4532.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Nationalistic identities often play an influential role in citizensâ voting behavior and political engagement.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFÎ²-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20Â±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19Â±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Youngâs modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFÎ²-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFÎ²-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFÎ²-1.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFÎ²-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20Â±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19Â±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Youngâs modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFÎ²-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFÎ²-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFÎ²-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFÎ²-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFÎ²-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties. RT can impact opposite ends of the patella tendon force-elongation relationship in each sex. Thus, different loading patterns may be needed to maximize resistance training adaptations in each sex.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5552.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Activation of intestinal tuft cell-expressed Sucnr1 triggers type 2 immunity in the mouse small intestine [Medical Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5552</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/21/5552.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The hallmark features of type 2 mucosal immunity include intestinal tuft and goblet cell expansion initiated by tuft cell activation.

Source analyses on event related potentials (ERPs) derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) were performed to examine the respective roles of cortical areas preceding exogenously triggered saccades, combined convergences, and combined divergences. All eye movements were triggered by the offset of a central fixation light emitting diode (LED) and the onset of a lateral LED at various depths in an otherwise fully darkened room. Our analyses revealed that three source pairs, two located in the frontal lobeâthe frontal eye fields (FEF) and an anterior frontal areaâ, and one located within the occipital cortex, can account for 99.2% of the observed ERPs. Overall, the comparison between source activities revealed the largest activity in the occipital cortex, while no difference in activity between FEF and the anterior frontal area was obtained. For all sources, increased activity was observed for combined vergences, especially combined convergences, relative to saccades. Behavioral results revealed that onset latencies were longest for combined convergences, intermediate for combined divergences, and the shortest for saccades. Together, these findings fit within a perspective in which both occipital and frontal areas play an important role in retinal disparity detection. In the case of saccades and combined divergences stimulus-locked activity was larger than response-locked activity, while no difference between stimulus- and response-locked activity was observed for combined convergences. These findings seem to imply that the electrophysiological activity preceding exogenous eye movements consists of a sensory-related part that is under cortical control, while subcortical structures may be held responsible for final execution.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>1d49a18d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198405</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0ab:2835af05</id><author><name>Monika Wojtczak-KwaÅniewska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Wojtczak-KwaÅniewska, Anna Przekoracka-Krawczyk, Rob H.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained.

By means of such process, which occurs at a microscopic scale, worn out bone is replaced by new, fully functional one. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously and independently throughout the body, so the whole skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years. Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types; some are specialized in destroying old bone, whereas others produce new bone to replace the former. The whole process is tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced exactly balances that of old one removed and bone microscopic structure is maintained. To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, the question arises of ascertaining whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process, or a consequence of operational redundancy.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2Â°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>118f9c95</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196973</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed8:2835af05</id><author><name>Chompunut Lumsangkul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

Interventions to enhance mental health and well-being within high risk industries such as the emergency services have typically focused on individual-level factors, though there is increasing interest in the role of organisational-level interventions. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of different aspects of manager support in determining the mental health of ambulance personnel. A cross-sectional survey was completed by ambulance personnel across two Australian states (N = 1,622). Demographics, manager support and mental health measures were assessed. Hierarchical multiple linear regressions were conducted to determine the explanatory influence of the employeeâs perception of the priority management places upon mental health issues (manager psychosocial safety climate) and managersâ observed behaviours (manager behaviour) on employee common mental disorder and well-being within ambulance personnel. Of the 1,622 participants, 123 (7.6%) were found to be suffering from a likely mental disorder. Manager psychosocial safety climate accounted for a significant amount of the variance in levels of employee common mental health disorder symptoms (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (13%, p&amp;lt;0.01). Manager behaviour had a lesser, but still statistically significant influence upon symptoms of common mental disorder (7% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.01) and well-being (10% of variance, p&amp;lt;0.05). The perceived importance management places on mental health and managersâ actual behaviour are related but distinct concepts, and each appears to impact employee mental health. While the overall variance explained by each factor was limited, the fact that each is potentially modifiable makes this finding important and highlights the significance of organisational and team-level interventions to promote employee well-being within emergency services and other high-risk occupations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>17e223cd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197802</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2338:2835af05</id><author><name>Katherine Petrie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine Petrie, AimÃ©e Gayed, Bridget T.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1Î±activation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1Î±activation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>High throughput nonparametric probability density estimation</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;
In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>7c17d2c4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6d:2835af05</id><author><name>Jenny Farmer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

Huntingtonâs disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntingtonâs Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5â8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40â44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>42</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>63769804</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197975</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2343:2835af05</id><author><name>Leire ValcÃ¡rcel-Ocete</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leire ValcÃ¡rcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, MarÃ­a GarcÃ­a-Barcina, Raymund A.

During clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast cells, short actin filaments (&amp;lt; 200nm) and crosslinking protein fimbrin assemble to drive the internalization of the plasma membrane. However, the organization of the actin meshwork during endocytosis remains largely unknown. In addition, only a small fraction of the force necessary to elongate and pinch off vesicles can be accounted for by actin polymerization alone. In this paper, we used mathematical modeling to study the self-organization of rigid actin filaments in the presence of elastic crosslinkers in conditions relevant to endocytosis. We found that actin filaments condense into either a disordered meshwork or an ordered bundle depending on filament length and the mechanical and kinetic properties of the crosslinkers. Our simulations also demonstrated that these nanometer-scale actin structures can store a large amount of elastic energy within the crosslinkers (up to 10&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; per crosslinker). This conversion of binding energy into elastic energy is the consequence of geometric constraints created by the helical pitch of the actin filaments, which results in frustrated configurations of crosslinkers attached to filaments. We propose that this stored elastic energy can be used at a later time in the endocytic process. As a proof of principle, we presented a simple mechanism for sustained torque production by ordered detachment of crosslinkers from a pair of parallel filaments.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HugZ5m7-OgU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>c3e2c303</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006150</link><crawled>1527617284143</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163ad15e82f:1385da6:c2c34441</id><author><name>Rui Ma</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rui Ma, Julien Berro&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Obesity paradox refers to lower mortality in subjects with higher body mass index (BMI), and has been documented under a variety of condition. However, whether obesity paradox exists in adults requiring mechanical ventilation in intensive critical units (ICU) remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;MEDLINE, EMBASE, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM) and CINAHL electronic databases were searched from the earliest available date to July 2017, using the following search terms: âbody weightâ, âbody mass indexâ, âoverweightâ or âobesityâ and âventilatorâ, âmechanically ventilatedâ, âmechanical ventilationâ, without language restriction. Subjects were divided into the following categories based on BMI (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): underweight, &amp;lt; 18.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; normal, 18.5â24.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; overweight, BMI 25â29.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; obese, 30â39.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; and severely obese &gt; 40 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The primary outcome was mortality, and included ICU mortality, hospital mortality, short-term mortality (&amp;lt;6 months), and long-term mortality (6 months or beyond). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital. A random-effects model was used for data analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 15,729 articles were screened. The final analysis included 23 articles (199,421 subjects). In comparison to non-obese patients, obese patients had lower ICU mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.0.84â0.92, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), hospital mortality (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74â0.93, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 52%), short-term mortality (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.74â0.88, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) as well as long-term mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60â0.79, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). In comparison to subjects with normal BMI, obese patients had lower ICU mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82â0.93, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 5%). Hospital mortality was lower in severely obese and obese subjects (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53â0.94, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 74%, and OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73â0.89, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 30%). Short-term mortality was lower in overweight and obese subjects (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.75â0.90, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%, and, OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66â0.84, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8%, respectively). Long-term mortality was lower in severely obese, obese and overweight subjects (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18â0.83, and OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46â0.86, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 56%, and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57â0.77, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). All 4 mortality measures were higher in underweight subjects than in subjects with normal BMI. Obese subjects had significantly longer duration on mechanical ventilation than non-obese group (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.16â0.80, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 37%), In comparison to subjects with normal BMI, severely obese BMI had significantly longer time in mechanical ventilation (MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.38â1.83, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 47%). Hospital LOS did not differ between obese and non-obese patients (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.50, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 80%). Obese patients had longer ICU LOS than non-obese patients (MD 0.38, 95% CI 0.17â0.59, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 70%). Hospital LOS and ICU LOS did not differ significantly in subjects with different BMI status.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation, higher BMI is associated with lower mortality and longer duration on mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>193af6fc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198669</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0ba:2835af05</id><author><name>Yonghua Zhao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yonghua Zhao, Zhiqiang Li, Tao Yang, Meiping Wang, Xiuming Xi&lt;/p&gt;

Obese subjects had significantly longer duration on mechanical ventilation than non-obese group (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.16â0.80, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 37%), In comparison to subjects with normal BMI, severely obese BMI had significantly longer time in mechanical ventilation (MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.38â1.83, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 47%). Hospital LOS did not differ between obese and non-obese patients (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.50, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 80%). Obese patients had longer ICU LOS than non-obese patients (MD 0.38, 95% CI 0.17â0.59, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 70%). Hospital LOS and ICU LOS did not differ significantly in subjects with different BMI status.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation, higher BMI is associated with lower mortality and longer duration on mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/qMFwb2pJLPs/s41598-018-25805-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>774</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25805-x/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25805_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>2300</height><contentType>application/octet-stream</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25805-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25805-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25805-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25805-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qMFwb2pJLPs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>115c4e14</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25805-x</link><crawled>1526337345875</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16360cb9953:32b4bf6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yong-qiang Charles An</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25805-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25805-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Dynamic Changes of Genome-Wide DNA Methylation during Soybean Seed Development&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/qMFwb2pJLPs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334722v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Nucleotide-pair encoding of 16S rRNA sequences for host phenotype and biomarker detection [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/334722</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334722v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>We propose subsequence based 16S rRNA data processing, as a new paradigm for sequence phenotype classification and biomarker detection. This method and software called DiTaxa substitutes standard OTU-clustering or sequence-level analysis by segmenting 16S rRNA reads into the most frequent variable-length subsequences. These subsequences are then used as data representation for downstream phenotype prediction, biomarker detection and taxonomic analysis. Our proposed sequence segmentation called nucleotide-pair encoding (NPE) is an unsupervised data-driven segmentation inspired by Byte-pair encoding, a data compression algorithm.

We compared the performance of DiTaxa to the state-of-the-art methods in disease phenotype prediction and biomarker detection, using human-associated 16S rRNA samples for periodontal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as a synthetic benchmark dataset. DiTaxa identified 13 out of 21 taxa with confirmed links to periodontitis (recall=0.62), relative to 3 out of 21 taxa (recall=0.14) by the state-of-the-art method. On synthetic benchmark data, DiTaxa obtained full precision and recall in biomarker detection, compared to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. In addition, machine-learning classifiers trained to predict host disease phenotypes based on the NPE representation performed competitively to the state-of-the art using OTUs or k-mers. For the rheumatoid arthritis dataset, DiTaxa substantially outperformed OTU features with a macro-F1 score of 0.76 compared to 0.65. Due to the alignment- and reference free nature, DiTaxa can efficiently run on large datasets.

The assumptions behind this hypothesis as well as its consequences for experimental and theoretical biology are discussed.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Xp2dftH9ge8/s41598-018-26323-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26323-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26323_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>212</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xp2dftH9ge8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526886000000</published><fingerprint>4860c184</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6</link><crawled>1526893870372</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16381f77d24:6535e3d:2835af05</id><author><name>Yaogai Lv</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study, Published online: 21 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26323-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26323-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Association of Blood Pressure with Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Northeast China: A Cross-Sectional Study&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Xp2dftH9ge8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>High prevalence of MRSA and multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria in refugees admitted to the hospitalâBut no hint of transmission</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annelene Kossow, Bianca StÃ¼hmer, Frieder Schaumburg, Karsten Becker, Birgit Glatz, Mareike MÃ¶llers, Stefanie Kampmeier, Alexander Mellmann&lt;/p&gt;
With high numbers of refugees arriving in Europe uncertainty exists as to whether multidrug-resistant organisms are imported into the healthcare system. In our study, we identified 383 refugee-inpatients admitted to the University Hospital MÃ¼nster, Germany between September 2015 and September 2016. For this patient cohort screening for Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) and Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was recommended in our institution. Until May 2016 pre-emptive isolation was applied to all refugee-inpatients until the exclusion of these multidrug-resistant organisms. MRSA were found in 34 refugee-patients (9.8%), MDR-GNB in 25 refugee-patients (12.9%) and VRE in none of the refugee patients. We did not find any strains carrying carbapenemases. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data demonstrated that the respective isolates were genetically heterogeneous and revealed no transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients. We therefore omitted pre-emptive isolation as an infection control measure for this group of patients. Furthermore, molecular typing did not show evidence for nosocomial transmission from refugee-patients to other patients. Standard hygiene measures successfully prevented the transmission of refugee-patient isolates to other patients and as a result introduction into the healthcare system. This underlines that any multidrug-resistant organisms present within this cohort are not of any extraordinary concern for health systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>64e3193c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198103</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b940:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Annelene Kossow</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annelene Kossow, Bianca StÃ¼hmer, Frieder Schaumburg, Karsten Becker, Birgit Glatz, Mareike MÃ¶llers, Stefanie Kampmeier, Alexander Mellmann&lt;/p&gt;

Most Malawian women who start ART under Option B+ are still in care three years later, a higher than average adherence rate for life-threatening chronic disease treatments, worldwide (50%). We asked 75 Malawian on ART their motivations for remaining in treatment, and what barriers they overcame. Focus groups and interviews included 75 women on ART for 6+ months, at 12 health facilities. Four main motivations for continuing ART emerged: 1) evidence that ART improved their own and their childrenâs health; 2) strong desire to be healthy and keep their children healthy; 3) treatment was socially supported; 4) HIV/ART counselling effectively showed benefits of ART and told women what to expect. Women surmounted the following barriers: 1) stigma; 2) health care system; 3) economic; 4) side effects. Women stayed on ART because they believed it works.

Millions of people worldwide currently suffer from serious neurological diseases and injuries for which there are few, and often no, effective treatments. The paucity of effective interventions is, no doubt, due in large part to the complexity of the disorders, as well as our currently limited understanding of their pathophysiology. The bleak picture for patients, however, is also attributable to avoidable impediments stemming from quality concerns in preclinical research that often escape detection by research regulation efforts. In our essay, we connect the dots between these concerns about the quality of preclinical research and their potential ethical impact on the patients who volunteer for early trials of interventions informed by it. We do so in hopes that a greater appreciation among preclinical researchers of these serious ethical consequences can lead to a greater commitment within the research community to adopt widely available tools and measures that can help to improve the quality of research.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fW_TBERyuhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>c641135f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006343</link><crawled>1528308307203</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163d6461503:1bc34f1:c2c34441</id><author><name>Mark Yarborough</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mark Yarborough, Annelien Bredenoord, Flavio DâAbramo, Nanette C.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-Î± and TGF-Î²1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; â0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and â48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; â0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and â55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>cdd4764d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd1:2835af05</id><author><name>Shu-Jui Kuo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Î²1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours.

The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) and control (0.30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). The final average VWC was 0.11, 0.22, and 0.31 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and significant differences in biomass accumulation were observed between control and drought treatments. Second, 42 diverse sorghum genotypes were subjected to a seven-day dry-down treatment for a final drought stress of 0.15 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; VWC. The final average VWC was 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and plants presented significant differences in photosynthetic rate during the drought period. These results demonstrate that cost-effective automation systems can successfully control substrate water content for each plant, to accurately compare their phenotypic responses to drought, and be scaled up for high-throughput phenotyping studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>57</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>9d747fe1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198546</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd1:3dd877af</id><author><name>Diego Ortiz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Ortiz, Alexander G.

In preparation for dramatic morphogenetic events of gastrulation, rapid embryonic cell cycles slow at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos, down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity initiates this slowing by delaying replication of heterochromatic satellite sequences and extending S phase. We found that Cdk1 activity inhibited the chromatin association of Rap1 interacting factor 1 (Rif1), a candidate repressor of replication. Furthermore, Rif1 bound selectively to satellite sequences following Cdk1 down-regulation at the MBT. In the next S phase, Rif1 dissociated from different satellites in an orderly schedule that anticipated their replication. Rif1 lacking potential phosphorylation sites failed to dissociate and dominantly prevented completion of replication. Loss of Rif1 in mutant embryos shortened the post-MBT S phase and rescued embryonic cell cycles disrupted by depletion of the S phaseâpromoting kinase, cell division cycle 7 (Cdc7). Our work shows that Rif1 and S phase kinases compose a replication timer controlling first the developmental onset of late replication and then the precise schedule of replication within S phase. In addition, we describe how onset of late replication fits into the progressive maturation of heterochromatin during development.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ajE-XA15ViE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>d147a66b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005687</link><crawled>1525975398614</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1634b38b8d6:499b84:abeb7260</id><author><name>Charles A.

In the first excited state, the HâBs of the fluoride complex 1cFH2 are overall strengthened, which induces the weak fluorescence emission. In addition, molecular orbital analysis demonstrates that 1cFH2 has more obvious intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character in the S1 state than 1cH2 formed between the probe 1c and two water molecules, which also gives reason to the weaker fluorescence intensity of 1cFH2. Further, our calculated UVâvis absorbance and fluorescence spectra are in accordance with the experimental measurements.

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in Ontario, Canada. We describe the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario and examine trends in the incidence of non-disseminated and disseminated LD. LD surveillance data from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) from 2005â2014 were mapped to symptoms according to syndrome groups (erythema migrans (EM), flu-like, cardiac, neurologic or arthritic) and disease stages (early localized, early disseminated or late disseminated). During the study period, 1,230 cases due to &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdoferi&lt;/i&gt; were reported in Ontario with annual incidence rates ranging from 0.32 (2006) to 2.16 (2013) cases per 100,000 population. Seventy percent of cases had EM and the proportion of cases with EM increased over time. Other clinical manifestations included flu-like (75%), arthritic (42%), neurologic (41%) and cardiac (6%) symptoms. Early localized disease (n = 415) manifested with EM (87%) and flu-like (57%) symptoms; early disseminated disease (n = 216) manifested with neurologic (94%), cardiac (10%) and EM (63%) symptoms; and late disseminated disease (n = 475) manifested with EM (62%), neurologic (55%), cardiac (9%), and arthritic symptoms (i.e., arthralgia (93%) and arthritis (7%)). Early localized and early disseminated cases (88% each) occurred primarily from May through September, compared to late disseminated cases (81%). The proportion of cases reported to public health within 30 days of illness onset increased during the study period, while the proportion of cases reported within 1â3 months and &gt;3 months decreased. Geographical variations characterized by higher incidence of early localized disease and earlier public health notification (within 30 days of illness onset) occurred in regions with established or recently established LD risk areas, while later public health notification (&gt;3 months after illness onset) was reported more frequently in regions with recently established or no identified risk areas. This is the first study to describe the clinical manifestations of LD in Ontario, Canada. The observed geographical variations in the epidemiology of LD in Ontario reinforce the need for regionally focused public health strategies aimed at increasing awareness, promoting earlier recognition and reporting, and encouraging greater uptake of preventive measures.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>eb80536c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198509</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84558:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Karen O.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>450d9d2e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197432</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fda:2835af05</id><author><name>Rivka R.

&lt;i&gt;Arachis hypogaea&lt;/i&gt; L. geocarpy is a unique feature different from other legume plants. Flowering and fertilization occur above ground, while the following processes of pod formation and development proceed in the soil. The zygote divides only few times to develop into pre-embryo and then further embryo developmental process stops when the gynoecium is exposed to light condition or normal day/night period. In this study, eight phytochrome genes were identified in two wild peanuts (four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis duranensis&lt;/i&gt; and four in &lt;i&gt;Arachis ipaensis&lt;/i&gt;). Using RACE and homologous cloning, the full CDS of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AhphyB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AhphyE&lt;/i&gt; were acquired in cultivated peanut. Protein structure analysis showed that the conservative coding domains of phytochromes from a number of other plant species were found in these proteins. The C-terminal of AhphyA, AhphyA-like and AhphyB could interact with phytochrome-interacting factor 3 in vitro. The expression patterns of these genes in various tissues were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and significant differences were observed. Interestingly, the expression levels of &lt;i&gt;AhphyA-like&lt;/i&gt; changed significantly during gynophore growth and early pod development. Furthermore, protein accumulation patterns of AhphyA and AhphyB in gynophore were different during early pod development stages in that AhphyA and AhphyB proteins were not detected in S1 and S2 gynophores, while significant accumulation of AhphyA and AhphyB were detected in S3 gynophore. These results provided evidence that phytochromes mediated light signal transduction may play key roles in peanut geocarpy development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>a3927e5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198041</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd83:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ye Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ye Zhang, Jinbo Sun, Han Xia, Chuanzhi Zhao, Lei Hou, Baoshan Wang, Aiqin Li, Min Chen, Shuzhen Zhao, Xingjun Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Personality traits are related to many aspects of oneâs life, including risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish.

Personality traits are related to many aspects of oneâs life, including risk taking, sociability, and behavioral changes caused by psychoactive substances. This study aimed to investigate individual differences and behavioral changes due to alcohol exposure in zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;). To that end, adult animals were separated into two behavioral profiles: bold and shy, according to their risk taking behavior in an emergence test. Bold and shy fish were allowed to explore a 5-chamber tank and were tested for exploration and sociability (shoaling behavior) following alcohol exposure. The acute drug exposure treatments were 0.0%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v%) alcohol. The behavioral parameters evaluated were average and maximum swimming speed, total distance traveled, total time spent immobile, and time spent near a shoal or exploring the tank. For the groups that received no alcohol (0.0% alcohol), shy individuals spent more time near the shoal than bold fish. However, 0.5% alcohol increased bold fish responsiveness to the shoal, while both 0.1% and 0.5% alcohol diminished shoaling in shy fish. Our results show that the behavioral profiles of zebrafish are affected differently by alcohol, with shy animals seemingly more sensitive to behavioral change due to drug exposure. Moreover, we confirm zebrafish as a model for alcohol induced functional (exploration and social behavior) changes that could be useful in high throughput drug screens.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaat8526?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><title>[Editors&apos; Choice] Sweet skin remedy</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/440/eaat8526.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaat8526?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Up-regulation of glucose transport drives keratinocyte proliferation, whereas its inhibition offers therapeutic potential against psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1525888246000</published><fingerprint>f4fd8e2f</fingerprint><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/440/eaat8526?rss=1</link><crawled>1525889484284</crawled><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_1634619c5fc:d47db5:93d646dc</id><author><name>Houtkooper, R.</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;Up-regulation of glucose transport drives keratinocyte proliferation, whereas its inhibition offers therapeutic potential against psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020567?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>The effect of sampling techniques used in the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest method</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020567?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526268753000</published><fingerprint>96bcb0f6</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5020567?af=R</link><crawled>1526387566858</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16363c9e90a:38e659e:2835af05</id><author><name>C.

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>301ad1eb</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a21a1:93d646dc</id><author><name>Heidi S.

Immediately following a fracture, a fibrin laden hematoma is formed to prevent bleeding and infection. Subsequently, the organized removal of fibrin, via the protease plasmin, is essential to permit fracture repair through angiogenesis and ossification. Yet, when plasmin activity is lost, the depletion of fibrin alone is insufficient to fully restore fracture repair, suggesting the existence of additional plasmin targets important for fracture repair. Previously, activated matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was demonstrated to function in fracture repair by promoting angiogenesis. Given that MMP-9 is a defined plasmin target, it was hypothesized that pro-MMP-9, following plasmin activation, promotes fracture repair. This hypothesis was tested in a fixed murine femur fracture model with serial assessment of fracture healing. Contrary to previous findings, a complete loss of MMP-9 failed to affect fracture healing and union through 28 days post injury. Therefore, these results demonstrated that MMP-9 is dispensable for timely fracture union and cartilage transition to bone in fixed femur fractures. Pro-MMP-9 is therefore not a significant target of plasmin in fracture repair and future studies assessing additional plasmin targets associated with angiogenesis are warranted.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>35224659</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198088</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b93f:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Masato Yuasa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Masato Yuasa, Masanori Saito, Cesar Molina, Stephanie N.

Pro-MMP-9 is therefore not a significant target of plasmin in fracture repair and future studies assessing additional plasmin targets associated with angiogenesis are warranted.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/WL0jvszCJ0U/s41467-018-04435-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>In situ edge engineering in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04435-x/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4435_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>662</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04435-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04435-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In situ edge engineering in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situ edge engineering in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides, Published online: 24 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04435-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04435-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The unique properties of 2D materials are affected by the discontinuities posed by the structureâs edge.

There is a rapid growing body of knowledge regarding physical aspects of a football match due to studies using computer-assisted motion analysis. The present study used time-motion analysis and triaxial-accelerometers to obtain new insights about differences in physical profiles of elite football players across playing-positions. Player performance data in 23 official home matches from a professional football club, during two seasons were collected for analysis. Eighteen players from five different playing positions (central backs: n = 3; full-backs: n = 5; central midfielders: n = 6; wide midfielders: n = 3; and central forwards: n = 4), performing a total of 138 observations. A novel finding was that central backs and central midfielders had significantly lower work-rate in sprints, decelerations and accelerations than full-backs, wide midfielders and central forwards (p&amp;lt;0.001). Furthermore, wide midfielders and full-backs performed significantly more turns (&gt;90Â°) than central backs. The most common distance covered in high-intensity runs (â¥19.8 kmÂ·h&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;) for central backs, central midfielders, wide midfielders and central forwards was 1â5 m, but for full-backs was 6â10 m. This may help coaches in developing individualized training programs to meet the demands of each position in match-play.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>49</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>5bfd580e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198115</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3b:2835af05</id><author><name>Ivan Baptista</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Baptista, Dag Johansen, AndrÃ© Seabra, Svein Arne Pettersen&lt;/p&gt;

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>10</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>9868ed43</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</link><crawled>1526924658806</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16383cd4876:d8bafb:abeb7260</id><author><name>Ji Hyun Bak</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ji Hyun Bak, Seogjoo J.

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>A fixable probe for visualizing flagella and plasma membranes of the African trypanosome</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;
The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>7434b073</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c0:2835af05</id><author><name>Justin Wiedeman</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440â460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620â700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170Â°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>74e1d818</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197340</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f80:2835af05</id><author><name>Naveed Ahmad</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting and low activityâboth common in older peopleâare associated with increased mortality and poorer health. Whether having a more negative attitude to ageing is associated with higher levels of these behaviours is unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We investigated the prospective relationship between attitudes to ageing and objectively measured sedentary and walking behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants were 271 members of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. At age 72 years, participants completed the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire which assesses attitudes on three domainsâPsychosocial loss, Physical change and Psychological growth. At age 79 years, participants wore an activPAL activity monitor for seven days. The outcome measures were average daily time spent sedentary, number of sit-to-stand transitions, and step count.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant associations between any of the Attitude to Ageing domain scores and time spent sedentary or number of sit-to-stand transitions. In sex-adjusted analysis, having a more positive attitude to ageing as regards Physical change was associated with a slightly higher daily step count, for a SD increment in score, average daily step count was greater by 1.5% (95% CI 0.6%, 2.4%). On further adjustment for potential confounding factors these associations were no longer significant.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We found no evidence that attitudes to ageing at age 72 were predictive of sedentary or walking behaviour seven years later. Future studies should examine whether attitudes to ageing are associated with objectively measured walking or sedentary behaviour at the same point in time.

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>7837dbbd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197073</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f73:2835af05</id><author><name>Melissa E.

The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/xvLfnaEfQRA/s41591-018-0035-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Elevated prenatal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0035-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone during pregnancy results in polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes in female offspring, possibly explaining its pathogenesis as well as suggesting a possible therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xvLfnaEfQRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>637</engagement><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>955ca763</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5</link><crawled>1526311531793</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_1635f41b511:3097ffd:93d646dc</id><author><name>Brooke Tata</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated prenatal anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone reprograms the fetus and induces polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0035-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0035-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Excess anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone during pregnancy results in polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes in female offspring, possibly explaining its pathogenesis as well as suggesting a possible therapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/xvLfnaEfQRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item><item>Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><title>Shearing in flow environment promotes evolution of social behavior in microbial populations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34862</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34862</originId><summary><content>How producers of public goods persist in microbial communities is a major question in evolutionary biology.

Colorectal epithelial tumors occur spontaneously in dogs, and the pathogenesis seems to parallel that of humans. The development of human colorectal tumorigenesis has been linked to alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. This study characterized the fecal- and mucosa-associated microbiota in dogs with colorectal epithelial tumors (n = 10). The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S rDNA analysis and compared with that of control dogs (n = 13). We also determined the mucosa-associated microbiota composition in colonic tumor tissue (n = 8) and in adjacent non-tumor tissue (n = 5) by 16S rDNA- and rRNA profiling. The fecal microbial community structure in dogs with tumors was different from that of control samples and was distinguished by oligotypes affiliated with &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Porphyromonas&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Peptostreptococcus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt;, and lower abundance of &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clostridium&lt;/i&gt; XI and &lt;i&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/i&gt;. The overall community structure and populations of mucosal bacteria were not different based on either the 16S rDNA or the 16S rRNA profile in tumor tissue &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. adjacent non-tumor tissue. However, the proportion of live, potentially active bacteria appeared to be higher in non-tumor tissue compared with tumor tissue and included &lt;i&gt;Slackia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Roseburia&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Ruminococcaeceae&lt;/i&gt;, unclass. &lt;i&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oscillibacter&lt;/i&gt;. Colorectal tumors are rarely diagnosed in dogs, but despite this limitation, we were able to show that dogs with colorectal tumors have distinct fecal microbiota profiles.

The PRDS measures individual differences in peopleâs tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have.

These experiments, motivated by a hypothesized mechanism of folding, and the first of their kind, are consistent with folding to metastable but not necessarily equilibrium structures.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Correction: What matters to women during childbirth: A systematic qualitative review</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197791</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Soo Downe, Kenneth Finlayson, Olufemi T.

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>813c6442</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197954</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e2a:2835af05</id><author><name>Cole C.

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the associations of handgrip strength and cognitive function in cancer survivors â¥ 60 years old using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data in two waves of NHANES (2011â2014) were aggregated. Handgrip strength in kilogram (kg) was defined as the maximum value achieved using either hand. Two cognitive function tests were conducted among adults 60 years and older. The Animal Fluency Test (AFT) examines categorical verbal fluency (a component of executive function), and the Digital Symbol Substitution test (DSST) assesses processing speed, sustained attention, and working memory. Survey analysis procedures were used to account for the complex sampling design of the NHANES. Multiple linear regression models were used to estimate associations of handgrip strength with cognitive test scores, adjusting for confounders (age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, depressive symptoms and leisure time physical activity).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Among 383 cancer survivors (58.5% women, mean age = 70.9 years, mean BMI = 29.3 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), prevalent cancer types were breast (22.9%), prostate (16.4%), colon (6.9%) and cervix (6.2%). In women, each increase in kg of handgrip strength was associated with 0.20 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.33) higher score on AFT and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.30 to 1.35) higher score on DSST. In men, we observed an inverted U-shape association where cognitive function peaked at handgrip strength of 40â42 kg.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Handgrip strength, a modifiable factor, appears to be associated with aspects of cognitive functions in cancer survivors. Prospective studies are needed to address their causal relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>7eaa434b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197909</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b77a:3dd877af</id><author><name>Lin Yang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Yang, Ai Koyanagi, Lee Smith, Liang Hu, Graham A.

Accurate reporting and forecasting of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration are important for improving public health. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model, specially, a linear diffusive equation, to describe the spatial-temporal characteristics of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; in order to make short-term prediction. We analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of a real dataset from Chinaâs National Environmental Monitoring and validate the PDE-based model in terms of predicting the &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; concentration of the next day by the former daysâ history data. Our experiment results show that the PDE model is able to characterize and predict the process of &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; transport. For example, for 300 continuous days of 2016, the average prediction accuracy of the PDE model over all city-regions is 93% or 83% based on different accuracy definitions. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use PDE-based model to study &lt;i&gt;PM&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; prediction in both temporal and spatial dimensions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>77da760b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197666</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f43:2835af05</id><author><name>Yufang Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yufang Wang, Haiyan Wang, Shuhua Chang, Adrian Avram&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease involving the whole visual pathway. We prospectively examined potential benefits of volumetry of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a new 7T scanner.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;20 patients with normal tension glaucoma and 16 control individuals were examined. LGN volume and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the optic tract (OT) and the optic radiation (OR) and their correlation with RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) thickness were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;LGN volume was significantly reduced in NTG (60.9 vs 88.3; p &amp;lt; 0.05). FA of the OT (right: 0.35 vs 0.66, left: 0.36 vs 0.67; p &amp;lt; 0.05) and of the OR (right: 0.41 vs 0.70, left: 0.41 vs 0.69; p &amp;lt; 0.05) was also significantly reduced.

Temporal RNFL thickness correlated with the volume of the ipsilateral LGN (r = 0.603, p = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;NTG leads to significant atrophy of the LGN compared to controls.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is a simple and effective indicator that reflects visceral obesity. This study aimed to compare the significance of LAP in predicting hypertension risk with other obesity indices, and to evaluate the interactive effects of LAP and smoking, family history of hypertension on hypertension risk in Chinese Han adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community based cross-sectional study was performed in Bengbu, China. Participants received face-to-face questionnaire survey, anthropometric tests and laboratory examinations. Relevant indicators that reflect obesity including BMI (body mass index), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and LAP were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the association between LAP and hypertension risk. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) of LAP, BMI, and WHtR were calculated and then compared. Interactive effect was evaluated by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) and synergy index (SI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1777 participants were enrolled, and the prevalence of hypertension was 24.4% (n = 433). There was a significant increase in hypertension risk with LAP levels in the fourth quartile as compared with the bottom quartile (OR: 3.31, 95%CI: 1.76â6.25). The AUC of LAP was significantly different than that of BMI in males (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.158, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0309) and females (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 3.570, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0004), while only performed better in females as compared with that of WHtR (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.166, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0303). LAP was significantly interacted with family history of hypertension on hypertension risk both in males (RERI: 1.07, 95%CI: 0.09â2.05; AP: 0.33, 95%CI: 0.23â0.44; SI: 1.92, 95%CI: 1.53â2.41) and females (RERI: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.07â1.53; AP: 0.25, 95%CI: 0.11â0.39; SI: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.16â2.19). However, a significant interaction between LAP and smoking was only observed in males (RERI: 1.32, 95%CI: 0.15â2.75; AP: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.14â0.73).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Increased LAP was significantly associated with a higher risk of hypertension in Chinese Han adults.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the nonâcell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>ee3c4299</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</link><crawled>1526493856788</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a1fc414:493cd5:abeb7260</id><author><name>FranÃ§oise Helmbacher</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by FranÃ§oise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Xenon is frequently used as a general anesthetic in humans, but the mechanism remains an issue of debate. While for some membrane proteins, a direct interaction of xenon with the protein has been shown to be the inhibitory mechanism, other membrane protein functions could be affected by changes of membrane properties due to partitioning of the gas into the lipid bilayer. Here, the effect of xenon on a mechanosensitive ion channel and a copper ion-translocating ATPase was compared under different conditions. Xenon inhibited spontaneous gating of the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; mechano-sensitive mutant channel MscL-G22E, as shown by patch-clamp recording techniques. Under high hydrostatic pressure, MscL-inhibition was reversed. Similarly, the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus hirae&lt;/i&gt; CopB copper ATPase, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, was inhibited by xenon. However, the CopB ATPase activity was also inhibited by xenon when CopB was in a solubilized state. These findings suggest that xenon acts by directly interacting with these proteins, rather than &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; indirect effects by altering membrane properties. Also, inhibition of copper transport may be a novel effect of xenon that contributes to anesthesia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>ab5b7851</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198110</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b782:3dd877af</id><author><name>Evgeny Petrov</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Evgeny Petrov, Gopalakrishnan Menon, Paul R.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>118</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>3e9b2388</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</link><crawled>1525801275042</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><author><name>Matthew E.

We implemented a web server that compares new datasets to collected data employing fast matching methods in order to determine cell types, key genes, similar prior studies, and more.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Anthropology, Genetics</item></keywords><title>Founder effects in modern populations</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/976.12.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-l?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527788426000</published><fingerprint>46a21da1</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-l?rss=1</link><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09a9:2835af05</id><author><name>Zahn, L.

Vegetation was characterized floristically and structurally in all plots. Habitats were structurally distinct, and diversity differed between peripheral and non-peripheral areas of slags. Nine of the ninety-seven species identified are reported to (sub)humid biomes. Soils are dominantly shallow, eutrophic and sandy loam. However, soils in the periphery of slags are more developed once paludization, melanization and bioturbation were verified. Our results suggest that soil fertility did not influence vegetable cover in Caatinga. The cover of plant species considered exclusive of (sub)humid biomes in Brazil extends beyond highlands in the semiarid, associated with high soil organic carbon content and water retention capacity of more developed soils than the typical of the Caatinga.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>Identification of a critical sulfation in chondroitin that inhibits axonal regeneration</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37139</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37139</originId><summary><content>The failure of mammalian CNS neurons to regenerate their axons derives from a combination of intrinsic deficits and extrinsic factors.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) have variable spectrotemporal features, which researchers use to parse them into different categories. USVs may be important for communication, but it is unclear whether the categories that researchers have developed are relevant to the mice. Instead, other properties such as the number, rate, peak frequency, or bandwidth of the vocalizations may be important cues that the mice are using to interpret the nature of the social interaction. To investigate this, a comprehensive catalog of the USVs that mice are producing across different social contexts must be created. Forty male and female adult CBA/CaJ mice were recorded in isolation for five minutes following either a one-hour period of isolation or an exposure to a same- or opposite-sex mouse. Vocalizations were separated into nine categories based on the frequency composition of each USV. Additionally, USVs were quantified based on the bandwidth, duration, peak frequency, total number, and proportion of vocalizations produced. Results indicate that mice differentially produce their vocalizations across social encounters. There were significant differences in the number of USVs that mice produce across exposure conditions, the proportional probability of producing the different categories of USVs across sex and conditions, and the features of the USVs across conditions. In sum, there are sex-specific differences in production of USVs by laboratory mice, and prior social experiences matter for vocalization production. Furthermore, this study provides critical evidence that female mice probably produce vocalizations in opposite-sex interactions, which is important because this is an often overlooked variable in mouse communication research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>568f6afc</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197774</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f45:2835af05</id><author><name>Kali Burke</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kali Burke, Laurel A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Creatine kinase (CK) has been associated with reduced inflammation in obesity while inflammation is associated with obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the relationship between CK and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in a general population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CK and hs-CRP were measured in the population-based TromsÃ¸ study that included entire birth cohorts and random samples of citizens between 30â87 years of age. The analyses were performed sex-stratified in 5969 men and 6827 women.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;CK correlated negatively with hs-CRP in men (r = -0.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (r = -0.06, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). In univariable regression analyses, CK associated negatively with hs-CRP in men (&lt;i&gt;Ã&lt;/i&gt; = -0.14, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (&lt;i&gt;Ã&lt;/i&gt; = -0.13, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). Mean CK declined from the 2. to the 4. quartiles of hs-CRP in both genders (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001 for trends). There were positive correlations between CK and body mass index (BMI) in men (r = 0.10, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and women (r = 0.07, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed a 0.13 unit decrease in hs-CRP (mg/dl) per unit CK increase in men (95% CI -0.35 to -0.20) and 0.29 mg/dl in women (95% CI -0.36 to -0.21) when adjusted for age, BMI, lipids, s-glucose, s-creatinine, transaminases and coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CK were inversely and independently associated with hs-CRP in a general population.

In the Speech-to-Song Illusion, repetition of a spoken phrase results in it being perceived as if it were sung. Although a number of previous studies have examined which characteristics of the stimulus will produce the illusion, there is, until now, no description of the cognitive mechanism that underlies the illusion. We suggest that the processes found in Node Structure Theory that are used to explain normal language processing as well as other auditory illusions might also account for the Speech-to-Song Illusion. In six experiments we tested whether the satiation of lexical nodes, but continued priming of syllable nodes may lead to the Speech-to-Song Illusion. The results of these experiments provide evidence for the role of priming, activation, and satiation as described in Node Structure Theory as an explanation of the Speech-to-Song Illusion.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>cc265f9b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198656</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b9:2835af05</id><author><name>Nichol Castro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nichol Castro, Joshua M.

Verbal autopsy methods have been developed to determine medical causes of deathforprioritizing disease control programs. Additional information on social causesmay facilitate designing of more appropriate prevention strategies. Use of social autopsy in investigations of causes of adult deaths has been limited. Therefore, acommunity-based study was conducted in NandpurKalour Block of Fatehgarh Sahib District in Punjab (India)for finding social causes of adult deaths. An integrated verbal and social autopsy toolwas developed and verbal autopsies of 600 adult deaths, occurring over a reference period of one year, were conducted in 2014. Quantitative analysis described the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, number and type of consultations from health care providers, and type of care received during illness. Qualitative data was analyzed to find out social causes of death by thematic analysis. The median duration of illness from symptom onset till death was 9 days (IQR = 1â45 days). At the onset of illness, 72 (12%) deceased utilized home remedies and 424 (70.7%)received care from a clinic/hospital, and 104 (17.3%) died withoutreceiving any care. The number of medical consultations varied from one to six (median = 2). The utilization of government health facilities and qualified allopathic doctor increased with each consultation (p value&amp;lt;0.05). The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be âmildâ by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>5b743cf9</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198172</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b947:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Mamta Gupta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mamta Gupta, Manmeet Kaur, P.

The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be âmildâ by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271866v7?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>babette: BEAUti 2, BEAST2 and Tracer for R [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/271866</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/271866v7?rss=1</originId><content><content>In the field of phylogenetics, BEAST2 is one of the most widely used software tools.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide. HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice. Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>61fe2a71</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197861</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f233c:2835af05</id><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Zhang, Shuaiyin Chen, Guangyuan Zhou, Yuefei Jin, Rongguang Zhang, Haiyan Yang, Yuanlin Xi, Jingchao Ren, Guangcai Duan&lt;/p&gt;

Interpersonal needs are associated with suicide. However, no interpersonal needs questionnaire has been validated in Asia. The psychometric properties of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire were examined in a sample of 340 young male adults in Singapore. This questionnaire measures proximal causes of desire for suicide using the extent to which individuals believe that they are a burden to others (perceived burdensomeness) and the extent to which they believe their needs are not met (thwarted belongingness). Confirmatory factor analysis found that a two-factor model of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness provided an adequate fit for the data. Internal consistency was excellent. Concurrent, convergent, predictive, and discriminant validity was demonstrated. The findings showed that the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire provides a valid measure of interpersonal needs in young Asian males. Thus, the instrument can be utilized to test the interpersonal psychological theory of suicidal behavior.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>cfe6d42</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198839</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b31d:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Dorothy C.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-Î± induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-Î± 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins Î±-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-Î± induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91Â±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86Â±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-Î± decreased Î±-SMA (0.74Â±0.12, p&amp;lt;0.05) and SM22 (0.54Â±0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-Î± induced migration (1.25Â±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33Â±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258Â±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09Â±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32Â±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Inhibition of autophagy prevented all the TNF-Î±-induced phenotypic changes. TNF-Î± induces phenotype switching in A7r5 cell line by a mechanism that required autophagy. Therefore, autophagy may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>745f94a0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197210</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7b:2835af05</id><author><name>Marina GarcÃ­a-Miguel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marina GarcÃ­a-Miguel, Jaime A.

All these results demonstrated that, through integrating both Hi-C and FISH data into a unified framework, GEM-FISH can provide a better tool for modeling the 3D organizations of chromosomes than using the Hi-C data alone.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/ZLgrWZAPSWQ/s41467-018-04598-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: Spatial fidelity of workers predicts collective response to disturbance in a social insect</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Spatial fidelity of workers predicts collective response to disturbance in a social insect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Spatial fidelity of workers predicts collective response to disturbance in a social insect, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04598-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Spatial fidelity of workers predicts collective response to disturbance in a social insect&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/ZLgrWZAPSWQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>b4a558e7</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04598-7</link><crawled>1527758980254</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163b588049e:2de0a32:3dd877af</id><author><name>James D.

Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be a significant problem. Furthermore, the precise pathogenesis of this neurodegeneration is still unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and neuronal injury in the rhesus macaque using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; sampling techniques. The effect of SIV infection in 23 adult rhesus macaques was investigated using an accelerated NeuroAIDS model. Disease progression was modulated either with combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART, 4 animals) or minocycline (7 animals). Twelve animals remained untreated. Viral loads were monitored in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, as were levels of activated monocytes in the blood. Neuronal injury was monitored &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Viral RNA was quantified in brain tissue of each animal &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and neuronal injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Without treatment, viral RNA in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain tissue appears to reach a plateau. Neuronal injury was highly correlated both to plasma viral levels and a subset of infected/activated monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which are known to traffic the virus into the brain. Treatment with either cART or minocycline decreased brain viral levels and partially reversed alterations in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and immunohistochemical markers for neuronal injury. These findings suggest there is significant turnover of replicating virus within the brain and the severity of neuronal injury is directly related to the brain viral load.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>8c5b4e29</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196949</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6e:2835af05</id><author><name>R.

Background &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in primary SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome (SS) had been reported to be rare. However, recent studies using echocardiography as a screening method showed conflicting results, and the true prevalence is still unclear. Since diagnosing primary SS is difficult because of its heterogeneous nature, a number of patients with primary-SS-associated PAH may be misdiagnosed with idiopathic PAH, losing their chance to undergo immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the prevalence of primary SS among patients who initially present with PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From our prospective institutional PAH database, 40 consecutive patients without any obvious cause of PAH at the time of PAH diagnosis were identified. We retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of primary SS diagnosed during or after the initial assessment of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the initial assessment, one patient was diagnosed with primary-SS-associated PAH. Among the 25 patients who were initially diagnosed with idiopathic PAH, five were diagnosed with primary SS during their course of the disease. Of the five patients, three had key signs suggesting primary SS and were probably underdiagnosed at the time of initial evaluation. The remaining two patients, who were finally diagnosed with primary SS, did not have any specific signs suggesting primary SS at the time of initial evaluation but showed positive conversion of their autoantibodies during the course of PAH.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of primary-SS-associated PAH may be relatively high among patients who undergo initial evaluation for PAH. Furthermore, primary-SS-associated PAH may be underdiagnosed with routine evaluation for the primary cause of PAH.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>239aec5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a2198:93d646dc</id><author><name>Jonatan Almagor</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

In this study, we report a detailed experimental, binding free energy calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation investigation of the interactions of carboxylic-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-f-MWCNTs) with porcine trypsin (pTry). The enzyme exhibits decreased thermostability at 330K in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. Furthermore, the activity of pTry also decreases in the presence of COOH-f-MWCNTs. The restricted diffusion of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme was observed in the experiment. The MD simulation analysis suggested that this could be because of the blocking of the S1 pocket of pTry, which plays a vital role in the substrate selectivity. The intrinsic fluorescence of pTry is quenched with increase in the COOH-f-MWCNTs concentration. Circular dichroism (CD) and UVâvisible absorption spectroscopies indicate the ability of COOH-f-MWCNTs to experience conformational change in the native structure of the enzyme. The binding free energy calculations also show that electrostatics, Ï-cation, and Ï-Ï stacking interactions play important roles in the binding of the carboxylated CNTs with pTry. The MD simulation results demonstrated that the carboxylated CNTs adsorb to the enzyme stronger than the CNT without theâCOOH groups. Our observations can provide an example of the nanoscale toxicity of COOH-f-MWCNTs for proteins, which is a critical issue for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; application of COOH-f-MWCNTs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>e38b4d49</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198519</link><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf9:3dd877af</id><author><name>Maryam Noordadi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maryam Noordadi, Faramarz Mehrnejad, Reza H.

Aluminum-based adjuvants have widely been used in human vaccines since 1926. In the absence of antigens, aluminum-based adjuvants can initiate the inflammatory preparedness of innate cells, yet the impact of antigens on this response has not been investigated so far. In this study, we address the modulating effect of vaccine antigens on the monocyte-derived innate response by comparing processes initiated by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and by Infanrix, an Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-adjuvanted trivalent combination vaccine (DTaP), containing diphtheria toxoid (D), tetanus toxoid (T) and acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine antigens. A systems-wide analysis of stimulated monocytes was performed in which full proteome analysis was combined with targeted transcriptome analysis and cytokine analysis. This comprehensive study revealed four major differences in the monocyte response, between plain Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation conditions: (I) DTaP increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; did not; (II) Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increased the gene expression of &lt;i&gt;IFNÎ³&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IL-17a&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the limited induction or even downregulation by DTaP; (III) increased expression of type I interferons-induced proteins was not observed upon DTaP stimulation, but was observed upon Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation; (IV) opposing regulation of protein localization pathways was observed for Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation, related to the induction of exocytosis by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone. This study highlights that vaccine antigens can antagonize Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced programming of the innate immune responses at the monocyte level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>df1fe4c0</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197885</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c15:3dd877af</id><author><name>Sietske Kooijman</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sietske Kooijman, Jolanda Brummelman, CÃ©cile A.

This comprehensive study revealed four major differences in the monocyte response, between plain Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation conditions: (I) DTaP increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; did not; (II) Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increased the gene expression of &lt;i&gt;IFNÎ³&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;IL-17a&lt;/i&gt; in contrast to the limited induction or even downregulation by DTaP; (III) increased expression of type I interferons-induced proteins was not observed upon DTaP stimulation, but was observed upon Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation; (IV) opposing regulation of protein localization pathways was observed for Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and DTaP stimulation, related to the induction of exocytosis by Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone. This study highlights that vaccine antigens can antagonize Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced programming of the innate immune responses at the monocyte level.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/uh3lblCfPF4/s41598-018-25979-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1526</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-25979-4/MediaObjects/41598_2018_25979_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>2300</height><contentType>application/octet-stream</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25979-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25979-4</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25979-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25979-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uh3lblCfPF4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526540400000</published><fingerprint>6c032ba7</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25979-4</link><crawled>1526508965789</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1636b064f9d:43826e0:3dd877af</id><author><name>Shiori Toba</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25979-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25979-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Alpha-synuclein facilitates to form short unconventional microtubules that have a unique function in the axonal transport&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/uh3lblCfPF4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
