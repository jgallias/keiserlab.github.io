Objectives &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to examine whether mothers’ musical background has an effect on their own and their children’s sedentary behavior (SB) and physical activity (PA). The aim was also to assess children’s and their mothers’ exercise adherence when using movement-to-music video program.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;Sub-group analysis of an intervention group in a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN33885819).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;Seventy-one mother-child-pairs were divided into two categories based on mothers’ musical background. Each pair performed 8 weeks exercise intervention using movement-to-music video program. SB and PA were assessed objectively by accelerometer, and exercise activity, fidelity, and enjoyment were assessed via exercise diaries and questionnaires. Logistic regression model was used to analyze associations in the main outcomes between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Those children whose mothers had musical background (MB) had greater probability to increase their light PA during the intervention, but not moderate-to-vigorous PA compared to those children whose mothers did not have musical background (NMB). SB increased in both groups. Mothers in the NMB group had greater probability to increase their light and moderate-to-vigorous PA and decrease their SB than mothers in the MB group. However, exercise adherence decreased considerably in all groups. Completeness, fidelity, and enjoyment were higher among the NMB group compared to the MB group.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The present results showed that mothers without musical background were more interested in movement-to-music exercises, as well as their children. For further studies it would be important to evaluate an effect of children’s own music-based activities on their SB and PA.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195837</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb7:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pipsa P.

Copy number variations (CNVs) are gain and loss of DNA sequence of a genome. High throughput platforms such as microarrays and next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have been applied for genome wide copy number losses. Although progress has been made in both approaches, the accuracy and consistency of CNV calling from the two platforms remain in dispute. In this study, we perform a deep analysis on copy number losses on 254 human DNA samples, which have both SNP microarray data and NGS data publicly available from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project respectively. We show that the copy number losses reported from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genome Project only have &amp;lt; 30% overlap, while these reports are required to have cross-platform (e.g. PCR, microarray and high-throughput sequencing) experimental supporting by their corresponding projects, even though state-of-art calling methods were employed. On the other hand, copy number losses are found directly from HapMap microarray data by an accurate algorithm, i.e. CNVhac, almost all of which have lower read mapping depth in NGS data; furthermore, 88% of which can be supported by the sequences with breakpoint in NGS data. Our results suggest the ability of microarray calling CNVs and the possible introduction of false negatives from the unessential requirement of the additional cross-platform supporting. The inconsistency of CNV reports from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project might result from the inadequate information containing in microarray data, the inconsistent detection criteria, or the filtration effect of cross-platform supporting. The statistical test on CNVs called from CNVhac show that the microarray data can offer reliable CNV reports, and majority of CNV candidates can be confirmed by raw sequences. Therefore, the CNV candidates given by a good caller could be highly reliable without cross-platform supporting, so additional experimental information should be applied in need instead of necessarily.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196226</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d741:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shuo Li, Xialiang Dou, Ruiqi Gao, Xinzhou Ge, Minping Qian, Lin Wan&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The annual increase in costs and the quality of life of survivors of cardiac arrest are major concerns. This study used National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan to evaluate the 1-year survival rate and the annual healthcare costs of survivors after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective, fixed-cohort study conducted from 2006 to 2012, involved 2 million individuals randomly selected from the NHIRD of Taiwan. Adult patients at least 18 years old who were diagnosed with cardiac arrest were enrolled. Survival was followed up for 1 year.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 2,256 patients were enrolled. The survivor cohort accounted for 4% (89/2256) of the study population. There were no significant differences in the demographic characteristics of the survival and non-survival cohorts, with the exceptions of gender (male: survival vs. non-survival, 50.6% vs. 64.5%, p = 0.007), diabetes mellitus (49.4% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.009), and acute coronary syndrome (44.9% vs. 31.9%, p = 0.010). Only 38 (1.7%) patients survived for &gt; 1 year. The mean re-admission to hospital during the 1-year follow up was 73.5 (SD: 110.2) days. The mean healthcare cost during the 1-year follow up was $12,953. Factors associated with total healthcare costs during the 1-year follow up were as follows: city or county of residence, being widowed, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (city or county of residence, β: -23,604, p &amp;lt; 0.001; being widowed, β: 25,588, p = 0.049; COPD, β: 14,438, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There was a great burden of the annual healthcare costs of survivors of cardiac arrest. Socioeconomic status and comorbidity were major confounders of costs. The outcome measures of cardiac arrest should extend beyond the death, and encompass destitution. These findings add to our knowledge of the health economics and indicate future research about healthcare of cardiac arrest survivors.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b00745</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/nAvRqrLOvVw/acs.jpcb.8b00745</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Erika L.

The purpose of our work is to develop and evaluate a system that can identify combinations of variants underlying oligogenic diseases in individual whole exome or whole genome sequences. Methods: Information that links patient phenotypes to databases of gene-phenotype associations observed in clinical research can provide useful information and improve variant prioritization for Mendelian diseases. Additionally, background knowledge about interactions between genes can be utilized to guide and restrict the selection of candidate disease modules. Results: We developed OligoPVP, an algorithm that can be used to identify variants in oligogenic diseases and their interactions, using whole exome or whole genome sequences together with patient phenotypes as input.

Background &lt;p&gt;Bedaquiline, an antimycobacterial agent approved for drug-resistant tuberculosis, is metabolized by CYP3A4, an hepatic enzyme strongly induced by rifampin, an essential part of drug-sensitive tuberculosis treatment. We examined the pharmacokinetic interactions of bedaquiline plus either rifampin or rifabutin in 33 healthy volunteers. This sub-study of that trial examined the mycobactericidal activity of these drugs against intracellular &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; whole blood culture.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomly assigned to receive two single 400 mg doses of bedaquiline, alone, and, after a 4 week washout period, in combination with steady-state daily dosing of either rifabutin 300 mg or rifampin 600 mg. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and at multiple time points subsequently, to measure plasma drug concentrations and bactericidal activity in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo M tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;-infected whole blood cultures (WBA).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Single oral doses of bedaquiline produced readily detectable WBA &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;, reaching a maximal effect of -0.28 log/day, with negative values indicating bacterial killing. Plasma concentrations of 355 ng/ml were sufficient for intracellular mycobacteriostasis. Combined dosing with rifampin or rifabutin produced maximal effects of -0.91 and -0.79 log/d, respectively. However, the activity of the rifabutin combination was sustained throughout the dosing interval, thereby producing a greater cumulative or total effect. At low drug concentrations, rifabutin plus bedaquiline yielded greater mycobactericidal activity than the sum of their separate effects. Neither drug metabolites nor cellular drug accumulation could account for this observation.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The combination of rifabutin plus bedaquiline produces sustained intracellular mycobactericidal activity that is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Further studies of the treatment-shortening potential of this combination are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196756</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18d:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert S.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197169</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559155:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luisa Marenzoni, Lorenzo Santoni, Andrea Felici, Carmen Maresca, Valentina Stefanetti, Monica Sforna, Maria Pia Franciosini, Patrizia Casagrande Proietti, Francesco Carlo Origgi&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-α decreased α-SMA (0.74±0.12, p&amp;lt;0.05) and SM22 (0.54±0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Inhibition of autophagy prevented all the TNF-α-induced phenotypic changes. TNF-α induces phenotype switching in A7r5 cell line by a mechanism that required autophagy. Therefore, autophagy may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197210</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7b:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marina García-Miguel, Jaime A.

Background &lt;p&gt;MRI is the optimal method for sensitive detection of tumour tissue and pre-operative staging in oral cancer. When jawbone resections are necessary, the current standard of care for oral tumour surgery in our hospital is 3D virtual planning from CT data. 3D printed jawbone cutting guides are designed from the CT data. The tumour margins are difficult to visualise on CT, whereas they are clearly visible on MRI scans. The aim of this study was to change the conventional CT-based workflow by developing a method for 3D MRI-based lower jaw models. The MRI-based visualisation of the tumour aids in planning bone resection margins.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and findings &lt;p&gt;A workflow for MRI-based 3D surgical planning with bone cutting guides was developed using a four-step approach. Key MRI parameters were defined (phase 1), followed by an application of selected Black Bone MRI sequences on healthy volunteers (phase 2). Three Black Bone MRI sequences were chosen for phase 3: standard, fat saturated, and an out of phase sequence. These protocols were validated by applying them on patients (n = 10) and comparison to corresponding CT data. The mean deviation values between the MRI- and the CT-based models were 0.63, 0.59 and 0.80 mm for the three evaluated Black Bone MRI sequences. Phase 4 entailed examination of the clinical value during surgery, using excellently fitting printed bone cutting guides designed from MRI-based lower jaw models, in two patients with oral cancer. The mean deviation of the resection planes was 2.3 mm, 3.8 mm for the fibula segments, and the mean axis deviation was the fibula segments of 1.9°.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study offers a method for 3D virtual resection planning and surgery using cutting guides based solely on MRI imaging. Therefore, no additional CT data are required for 3D virtual planning in oral cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196059</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e800:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Astrid M.

Currently, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with short pulse duration and non-thermal effects have various potential applications in medicine and biology, especially in tumor ablation. Additionally, there are a few investigations on its proliferative effects in the normal cell. Clinically, proliferation of endothelial cells can perhaps accelerate the stent endothelialization and reduce the risk of acute thrombosis. To explore the feasibility using nsPEFs to induce proliferation of endothelial cells, in this study, porcine iliac endothelial (PIEC) cell line was cultured and tested by CCK-8 assay after nsPEFs treatment. The results reflected that nsPEFs with low field strength (100ns, 5 kV/cm, 10 pulses) had a significant proliferative effect with an increase in the PIEC cell growth of 16% after a 48 hour’ post-treatment. To further understand the mechanism of cell proliferation, intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration was measured through fluo-4 AM and reactive oxygen species assay was applied to estimate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the total nitric oxide assay for NO production in the cultured medium was evaluated. An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment. This in vitro preliminary study indicates that as a novel physical doping, the nsPEFs have potential in stimulating endothelial cells to accelerate stent endothelialization.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196688</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a69:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuchen Zhang, Feihong Dong, Zhengxin Liu, Jinsong Guo, Jue Zhang, Jing Fang&lt;/p&gt;

This in vitro preliminary study indicates that as a novel physical doping, the nsPEFs have potential in stimulating endothelial cells to accelerate stent endothelialization.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24411-1</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/1n1Ui1I9v1Y/s41598-018-24411-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Fei Xiao</name></author><published>1523948400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress</title><crawled>1523956924782</crawled><fingerprint>9eaa858a</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24411-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24411-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24411-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/1n1Ui1I9v1Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-24411-1/MediaObjects/41598_2018_24411_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>536</width></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d2e9416e:304f583:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24411-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-24411-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Stress-induced reverse martensitic transformation in a Ti-51Ni (at%) alloy aged under uniaxial stress&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/1n1Ui1I9v1Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24411-1</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4264.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/16/4264</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/16.cover-source.jpg?itok=dseVEs2E</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><author><name>Daria Genzel, Michael Schutte, W.

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasites of the genus &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt;, currently affecting more than 200 million people. Among the various species of this parasite that infect humans, &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; is the most common. Pharmacological treatment is limited to the use of a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ), despite reports of parasite resistance and low efficacy. It is therefore necessary to investigate new potential schistosomicidal compounds. In this study, we tested the efficacy of epiisopilosine (EPIIS) in a murine model of schistosomiasis. A single dose of EPIIS (100 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt; resulted in reduced worm burden and egg production. The treatment with the lower dose of EPIIS (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced total worm burden by 60.61% (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), as well as decreasing hepatosplenomegaly and egg excretion. Scanning electron microscopy revealed morphological changes in the worm tegument after treatment. Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196667</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f67:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

Despite good activity of EPIIS in adult &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, oral treatment with single dose of EPIIS 100 mg/kg had only moderate effects in mice infected with juvenile &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mansoni&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, we performed cytotoxicity and toxicological studies with EPIIS and found no &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity (in HaCaT, and NIH-3T3 cells) at a concentration of 512 μg/mL. We also performed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of toxicological properties and showed that EPIIS had low predicted toxicity. To confirm this, we investigated systemic acute toxicity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by orally administering a 2000 mg/kg dose to Swiss mice. Treated mice showed no significant changes in hematological, biochemical, or histological parameters compared to non-treated animals. Epiisopilosine showed potential as a schistosomicidal drug: it did not cause acute toxicity and it displayed an acceptable safety profile in the animal model.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03928-z</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/O6VAtjS7fP4/s41467-018-03928-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ze-Kun Yang</name></author><published>1524466800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Cross-coupling polycondensation via C–O or C–N bond cleavage</title><crawled>1524475568956</crawled><fingerprint>70c74eff</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03928-z</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cross-coupling polycondensation via C–O or C–N bond cleavage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-coupling polycondensation via C–O or C–N bond cleavage, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03928-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03928-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;π-Conjugated polymers are useful commodities as they are used in the fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes and field effect transistors.

Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals’ decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, fed worms prefer, while starved worms avoid the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative and that their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). With DM, worms efficiently reached specific temperatures, which explains their thermotactic behavior when fed. With IM, worms moved along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking, well-observed in previous studies. In contrast to fed animals, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute, but not the temporal derivative of temperature. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Thus, our IRL-based approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making, in other organisms.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kL4dFBBuUp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>17</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16322103638:4cd6c:910a81bb</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shoichiro Yamaguchi, Honda Naoki, Muneki Ikeda, Yuki Tsukada, Shunji Nakano, Ikue Mori, Shin Ishii&lt;/p&gt;

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197250</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7ad:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sandra H. van Oostrom, Peter M.

We investigated the impacts of the Mount Polley tailings impoundment failure on chemical, physical, and microbial properties of substrates within the affected watershed, comprised of 70 hectares of riparian wetlands and 40 km of stream and lake shore. We established a biomonitoring network in October of 2014, two months following the disturbance, and evaluated riparian and wetland substrates for microbial community composition and function via 16S and full metagenome sequencing. A total of 234 samples were collected from substrates at 3 depths and 1,650,752 sequences were recorded in a geodatabase framework. These data revealed a wealth of information regarding watershed-scale distribution of microbial community members, as well as community composition, structure, and response to disturbance. Substrates associated with the impact zone were distinct chemically as indicated by elevated pH, nitrate, and sulphate. The microbial community exhibited elevated metabolic capacity for selenate and sulfate reduction and an abundance of chemolithoautotrophs in the &lt;i&gt;Thiobacillus thiophilus/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;denitrificans/T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;thioparus&lt;/i&gt; clade that may contribute to nitrate attenuation within the affected watershed. The most impacted area (a 6 km stream connecting two lakes) exhibited 30% lower microbial diversity relative to the remaining sites. The tailings impoundment failure at Mount Polley Mine has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate functional and compositional diversity soon after a major catastrophic disturbance to assess metabolic potential for ecosystem recovery.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196032</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67a9:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heath W.

The tailings impoundment failure at Mount Polley Mine has provided a unique opportunity to evaluate functional and compositional diversity soon after a major catastrophic disturbance to assess metabolic potential for ecosystem recovery.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006125</link><recrawled>1524516127247</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/12Pj_Yzaong/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Guillaume Drion</name></author><published>1524517200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Switchable slow cellular conductances determine robustness and tunability of network states</title><updated>1524517200000</updated><crawled>1524506223239</crawled><fingerprint>f8812915</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006125</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre&lt;/p&gt;
Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162f3a6e287:392bd:a077e55f</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Guillaume Drion, Julie Dethier, Alessio Franci, Rodolphe Sepulchre&lt;/p&gt;

These first-in-class mitofusin agonists overcame dominant mitochondrial defects provoked in cultured neurons by CMT2A mutants MFN2 Arg&lt;sup&gt;94&lt;/sup&gt;-&gt;Gln&lt;sup&gt;94&lt;/sup&gt; and MFN2 Thr&lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;-&gt;Met&lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;, as demonstrated by amelioration of mitochondrial dysmotility, fragmentation, depolarization, and clumping. A mitofusin agonist normalized axonal mitochondrial trafficking within sciatic nerves of MFN2 Thr&lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt;-&gt;Met&lt;sup&gt;105&lt;/sup&gt; mice, promising a therapeutic approach for CMT2A and other untreatable diseases of impaired neuronal mitochondrial dynamism and/or trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>109</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196509</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196509</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196509</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Paula Finatto</name></author><published>1524603600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: Pilates training improves 5-km run performance by changing metabolic cost and muscle activity in trained runners</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><crawled>1524601266061</crawled><fingerprint>a76b8083</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196509</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paula Finatto, Edson Soares Da Silva, Alexandre B.

However, gene-annotation enrichment queries utilizing these resources can provide thousands of results with weak statistical significance that may be difficult to interpret without manually sorting into higher-order categories. Additionally, some ontology relations are problematic with respect to scope and hamper categorization, necessitating their omission lest erroneous term mappings occur. This omission leads to at least a 6% reduction in retrievable relational information in the Gene Ontology, yet including these terms results in over 31% (325180 out of 1036141) of term mappings being erroneous with respect to categorization when current tools are used. To address these issues, we present GOcats, a novel tool that organizes the Gene Ontology (GO) into subgraphs representing user-defined concepts, while ensuring that all appropriate relations are congruent with respect to scoping semantics. We tested GOcats performance using subcellular location categories to mine annotations from GO-utilizing knowledgebases and evaluating their accuracy against immunohistochemistry datasets in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA). In comparison to mappings generated from UniProt&apos;s controlled vocabulary and from GO slims via OWLTools&apos; Map2Slim, GOcats outperforms these methods without reliance on a human-curated set of GO terms. By identifying and properly defining relations with respect to semantic scope, GOcats can use traditionally problematic relations without encountering erroneous term mapping. We then applied GOcats in the comparison of HPA-sourced knowledgebase annotations to experimentally-derived annotations provided by HPA directly. During the comparison, GOcats improved correspondence between the annotation sources by adjusting semantic granularity. Utilized in this way, GOcats can perform an accurate knowledgebase-level evaluation of curated HPA-based annotations. Finally, we show that GOcats&apos; unique handling of relations improves enrichment statistics over conventional methods by integrating GOcats into the categoryCompare2 enrichment analysis pipeline and performing enrichment on a publicly-available breast cancer dataset. Specifically, we saw significant improvement (one-sided binomial test p-value=1.86E-25) in 182 of 217 significantly enriched GO terms identified from the conventional method when GOcats&apos; path traversal was used. We also found unique, significantly enriched terms using GOcats, whose biological relevancy has been experimentally demonstrated elsewhere.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/306936v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_162fa306516:6ce39d1:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Ontologies are used extensively in scientific knowledgebases and repositories to organize the wealth of available biological information.

Background &lt;p&gt;The typical degeneration of the vertebral endplate shown in MRI imaging is Modic change. The aim of this study was to observe the distribution of the Modic changes of vertebral endplate in degenerative thoracolumbar/lumbar kyphosis (DTK/LK) patients and analyse the correlation between spinal-pelvic parameters and Modic changes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The imaging data of 58 patients diagnosed with DTK/LK (coronal Cobb angle&amp;lt;10°with sagittal imbalance) in our hospital from March 2016 to May 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Observe the prevalence, type and distribution characteristics of Modic changes occurred at the vertebral endplate from T10 to S1;analyse the correlation between Modic changes and disc degeneration, the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), thoracic kyphosis (TK), thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK), lumbar lordosis (LL), sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT) and pelvic incidence (PI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 928 intervertebral endplates from 58 patients, Modic changes occurred at 90 endplates (9.7%) of 30 patients (51.7%). 5 endplates (0.5%) of 3 patients (5.2%) were classified as type I, 68 endplates (7.3%) of 25 patients (43.1%) as type II, 17 endplates (1.8%) of 9 patients (15.5%) as type III. The location of the degenerative endplates: 2 (2.2%) superior and inferior endplates of L1, 3 (3.3%) inferior endplates of T11and T12, 4 (4.4%) superior endplates of L2, 6 (6.7%) inferior endplates of L2 and L4, 8 (8.9%) superior endplates of S1, 9 (10%) superior endplates of L3, 11 (12.2%) inferior endplates of L3 and L5 and superior endplates of L4, 12 (13.3%) superior endplates of L5. Modic changes were significantly correlated with intervertebral disc degeneration (r = 0.414, p&amp;lt;0.01); the amount of Modic changes were significantly correlated with LL (r = -0.562, p = 0.012), SS (r = -0.46, p = 0.048), PT (r = 0.516, p = 0.024).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most of the Modic changes of vertebral endplates in DTK/LK patients are type II which are prevalently located at L3/4, L4/5 and L5/S1.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;One of the characteristics of early osteoarthritis (OA) is the loss of fixed charged density (FCD) of glycosaminoglycans in the superficial zone of articular cartilage. However, possible local changes in the FCD content of the pericellular matrix (PCM) are not fully understood. Hence, our aim was to investigate the effect of unilateral anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) in rabbit knees on estimated FCD in the PCM compared to that in the ECM, and relate these results with cell morphology.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Articular cartilage samples were collected from ACLT, contralateral and intact control knee joints from lateral and medial femoral condyles and tibial plateaus, and from the femoral groove and patella. Histological samples were prepared and stained with Safranin-O to estimate the FCD content around the chondrocytes in the PCM and the ECM with digital densitometry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As a result of ACLT, the greatest decreases in the FCD content of the PCM were observed in the superficial zone of the lateral femoral condyle (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), medial tibial plateau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) and patellar (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) cartilage. The normalized FCD content of the PCM compared to the surrounding ECM was increased most in the femoral condyles (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and medial tibial plateau (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) cartilage. The high normalized FCD content of the PCM in the superficial zone of lateral femoral condyle cartilage was consistent with the round cell morphology in that location.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we suggest that certain sites in the knee joint, particularly the lateral femoral condyle cartilage, experience less FCD loss in the PCM than in the ECM in early post-traumatic OA, which could lead to altered cell shape.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196203</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fdf3a72a:5f7702:9f3b30f2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simo P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42). Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: non-medical prescriber, human factors, and organisational aspects. Each theme consisted of several sub-themes; the four most highly mentioned were ‘medical professionals’, ‘area of competence’, ‘impact on time’ and ‘service’. Sub-themes were frequently interdependent on each other, having the potential to act as a barrier or facilitator depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Addressing the identified themes and subthemes enables strategies to be developed to support and optimise non-medical prescribing. Further research is required to identify if similar themes are encountered by other non-medical prescribing groups than nurses and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196471</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e47:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Graham-Clarke, Alison Rushton, Timothy Noblet, John Marriott&lt;/p&gt;

To date, the RV144 HIV vaccine trial has been the only study to show that immunization can confer protection from HIV infection. While encouraging, the modest 31.2% (P = 0.04) efficacy achieved in this study left significant room for improvement, and created an incentive to optimize the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine immunogens to increase the level of vaccine efficacy. Since the completion of the RV144 trial, our understanding of the antigenic structure of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and of the specificity of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that bind to it, has significantly improved. In particular, we have learned that multiple families of bN-mAbs require specific oligomannose glycans for binding. Both of the monomeric gp120 immunogens (MN- and A244-rgp120) in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial were enriched for glycans containing high levels of sialic acid, and lacked critical N-linked glycosylation sites required for binding by several families of bN-mAbs. The absence of these epitopes may have contributed to the low level of efficacy achieved in this study. In this report, we describe our efforts to improve the antigenic structure of the rgp120 immunogens used in the vaccine by optimizing glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by multiple bN-mAbs. Our results demonstrated that by shifting the location of one PNGS in A244-rgp120, and by adding two PNGS to MN-rgp120, in conjunction with the production of both proteins in a cell line that favors the incorporation of oligomannose glycans, we could significantly improve the binding by three major families of bN-mAbs. The immunogens described here represent a second generation of gp120-based vaccine immunogens that exhibit potential for use in RV144 follow-up studies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196370</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb2:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rachel C.

To date, the RV144 HIV vaccine trial has been the only study to show that immunization can confer protection from HIV infection. While encouraging, the modest 31.2% (P = 0.04) efficacy achieved in this study left significant room for improvement, and created an incentive to optimize the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine immunogens to increase the level of vaccine efficacy. Since the completion of the RV144 trial, our understanding of the antigenic structure of the HIV envelope protein, gp120, and of the specificity of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that bind to it, has significantly improved. In particular, we have learned that multiple families of bN-mAbs require specific oligomannose glycans for binding. Both of the monomeric gp120 immunogens (MN- and A244-rgp120) in the AIDSVAX B/E vaccine used in the RV144 trial were enriched for glycans containing high levels of sialic acid, and lacked critical N-linked glycosylation sites required for binding by several families of bN-mAbs. The absence of these epitopes may have contributed to the low level of efficacy achieved in this study. In this report, we describe our efforts to improve the antigenic structure of the rgp120 immunogens used in the vaccine by optimizing glycan-dependent epitopes recognized by multiple bN-mAbs. Our results demonstrated that by shifting the location of one PNGS in A244-rgp120, and by adding two PNGS to MN-rgp120, in conjunction with the production of both proteins in a cell line that favors the incorporation of oligomannose glycans, we could significantly improve the binding by three major families of bN-mAbs.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197091</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914d:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914f:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

This generalizable mix-and-match strategy provides predictable retrosynthetic pathways to complex nanoparticle features that are otherwise inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>68</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/394.2.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Yeston, J.</name></author><published>1524764252000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Lessons learned from the JACS Challenge</title><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><fingerprint>39376ed7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6387/394-b?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd927:fc1f8953</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/598?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/598?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/598.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Candela, T., Wassing, B., ter Heege, J., Buijze, L.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>How earthquakes are induced</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>8c6b79cc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/598?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ee:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>79</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00499</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/1sNPYiKoDJQ/acs.jmedchem.8b00499</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Michael Grasso, Michelle A.

Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be a significant problem. Furthermore, the precise pathogenesis of this neurodegeneration is still unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and neuronal injury in the rhesus macaque using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; sampling techniques. The effect of SIV infection in 23 adult rhesus macaques was investigated using an accelerated NeuroAIDS model. Disease progression was modulated either with combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART, 4 animals) or minocycline (7 animals). Twelve animals remained untreated. Viral loads were monitored in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, as were levels of activated monocytes in the blood. Neuronal injury was monitored &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Viral RNA was quantified in brain tissue of each animal &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and neuronal injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Without treatment, viral RNA in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain tissue appears to reach a plateau. Neuronal injury was highly correlated both to plasma viral levels and a subset of infected/activated monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which are known to traffic the virus into the brain. Treatment with either cART or minocycline decreased brain viral levels and partially reversed alterations in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and immunohistochemical markers for neuronal injury. These findings suggest there is significant turnover of replicating virus within the brain and the severity of neuronal injury is directly related to the brain viral load.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196949</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6e:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by R.

The understanding on the roles of obesity and lifestyle behaviors in predicting executive function of adolescents has been limited. Low executive function proficiency may have adverse effects on adolescents’ school academic performance. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relationship between BMI-for-age and multiple lifestyle behaviors (operationalized as meal consumption, physical activity, and sleep quality) with executive function (operationalized as inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on a sample of Malaysian adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 513). Participants were recruited from two randomly selected schools in the state of Selangor in Malaysia. Using a self-administered questionnaire, parent participants provided information concerning their sociodemographic data, whereas adolescent participants provided information regarding their meal consumptions, physical activity, and sleep quality. The modified Harvard step test was used to assess adolescents’ aerobic fitness, while Stroop color-word, digit span, and trail-making tests were used to assess adolescents’ inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, respectively. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses were conducted for each outcome namely, inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. After adjusted for sociodemographic factors and BMI-for-age, differential predictors of inhibition and working memory were found. Habitual sleep efficiency significantly and positively predicted inhibition. Regular dinner intakes, physical activity levels, and sleep quality significantly and positively predicted working memory. Household income emerged as a consistent predictor for all executive function domains. In conclusion, an increased trend of obesity and unhealthy lifestyles among adolescents were found to be associated with poorer executive function. Regular dinner intakes, higher physical activity levels and better sleep quality predicted better executive function despite the inverse relationship between obesity and executive function. Future studies may explore how lifestyle modifications can optimize the development of executive function in adolescents as well as relieve the burden of obesity.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195934</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:334415a:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Joyce Ying Hui Tee, Wan Ying Gan, Kit-Aun Tan, Yit Siew Chin&lt;/p&gt;

We recommend the use of Chimera in combination with a variety of optimization algorithms for an efficient and robust optimization of multi-objective problems.</description><engagement>35</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><published>1524139352000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1524294006306</crawled><fingerprint>a9372ac9</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025150?af=R</originId><title>Note: On the dielectric constant of nanoconfined water</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 15, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_162e700b622:51b1d19:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/15&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 15&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Xi8w8S7nmEs/s41598-018-24437-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Nataliya Rohr-Udilova</name></author><published>1524034800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma</title><crawled>1524043206589</crawled><fingerprint>f32d15f5</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24437-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deviations of the immune cell landscape between healthy liver and hepatocellular carcinoma, Published online: 18 April 2018;

Objective &lt;p&gt;Prescribing individualized moderate exercise intensity is a useful method to reach positive effects on health status in obese adults. This study aimed to establish a practical reference equation to estimate the heart rate (HR) at individual ventilatory threshold (IVT) (HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;One hundred sixty-one obese subjects were clinically evaluated and characterized by anthropometric and body composition. Participants performed the six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and the cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess IVT. Multiple regression analysis for HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt;, including 6-MWT, anthropometric, and body composition parameters, as independent variables, was performed for both gender separately. A cross-validation study was also performed to determine the accuracy of the prediction equation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Whereas HR&lt;sub&gt;IVT&lt;/sub&gt; was not significantly different between males (121.5±18.3 bpm) and females (117.6±17.1 bpm), it differently correlated with physical and performance parameters.

This study examined how people evaluate ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors, especially their predictions of the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors (Study 1). Further, it examined the individual effects of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors of an actor on the evaluation of his/her trait by considering the cases where the actor engages in and does not engage in the other behavior (Study 2). Study 1 revealed that the likelihood of future prosocial behaviors of ordinary and extraordinary prosocial actors was perceived asymmetrically. Specifically, while the likelihood of ordinary prosocial actors to engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors was perceived as high, the same perception was not observed for extraordinary prosocial behaviors. On the other hand, extraordinary prosocial actors were perceived as highly likely to engage in both ordinary and extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Study 2 revealed that the evaluation of actors who engaged in extraordinary prosocial behaviors but not ordinary prosocial behaviors did not exceed the evaluation of actors who engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors but not extraordinary prosocial behaviors. Additionally, the effect of extraordinary prosocial behaviors was more when the actor also engaged in ordinary prosocial behaviors. These results suggest that extraordinary prosocial actors are evaluated highly when they also engage in ordinary prosocial behaviors.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196340</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bba5:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ikumi Futamura&lt;/p&gt;

The pseudokinase HER3, heterodimerisation partner of HER2, is widely implicated in the resistance to HER2-mediated therapy. Here, we show that lapatinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of HER2, is able to induce proliferation cooperatively with the HER3 ligand neuregulin. This counterintuitive synergy between inhibitor and growth factor depends on their ability to promote atypical HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation. By stabilising a particular HER2 conformer, lapatinib drives HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterocomplex formation.

The pseudokinase HER3, heterodimerisation partner of HER2, is widely implicated in the resistance to HER2-mediated therapy. Here, we show that lapatinib, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of HER2, is able to induce proliferation cooperatively with the HER3 ligand neuregulin. This counterintuitive synergy between inhibitor and growth factor depends on their ability to promote atypical HER2-HER3 heterodimerisation. By stabilising a particular HER2 conformer, lapatinib drives HER2-HER3 kinase domain heterocomplex formation. This dimer exists in a head-to-head orientation distinct from the canonical asymmetric active dimer. The associated clustering observed for these dimers predisposes to neuregulin responses, affording a proliferative outcome.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vascular calcification is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, no viable treatments for this condition have been identified. This study aimed to determine whether farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can reduce vascular calcification and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that FTI-277 significantly inhibits phosphate-induced mineral deposition by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, prevents VSMC osteogenic differentiation, and increases mRNA expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), an inhibitor of mineralization. FTI-277 increases Akt signaling in VSMC in short-term serum-stimulation assays and in long-term mineralization assays. In contrast, manumycin A has no effect on Akt signaling or mineralization. Co-incubation of VSMC with FTI-277 and SH6 (an Akt inhibitor) significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of FTI-277 on mineralization, demonstrating that FTI-277 inhibits calcification by activating Akt signaling. Over-expression of the constitutively active p110 sub-unit of PI3K in VSMC using adenovirus activates Akt, inhibits mineralization, suppresses VSMC differentiation and significantly enhances MGP mRNA expression. FTI-277 also inhibits phosphate-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of VSMC, and these effects are negated by co-incubation with SH6. Finally, using an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; model of vascular calcification, we demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits high phosphate-induced mineralization in aortic rings derived from rats with end-stage renal failure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Together, these results demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits VSMC mineral deposition by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that targeting farnesylation, or Akt specifically, may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa2:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Arvind Ponnusamy, Smeeta Sinha, Gareth D.

They’re specifically addressing the “make it less lipophilic” rule of thumb that many medicinal chemists have, and they demonstrate that this isn’t exactly a universal law. You have to take it case by case, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot.jpeg 818w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13511&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re working from Genentech’s large database of rat i.v. PK data, stability in rat heptatocytes, and measured (not calculated) logD values. That’s a lot of hard-won data (4767 compounds total), and I’m glad that they’re sharing conclusion from it. The plot at right is an example; each dot is a compound, and they’re shaded according to logD values (&amp;lt;0 to &gt;4). What you see is that IV clearance and (unbound, steady-state) volume of distribution are strongly correlated, and that for the most part this graph is spread along compound lipophilicity. There are outliers (there are always outliers), but that’s the way to bet. As for half-life itself, the spreads in the data are pretty wide, but if anything, higher lipophilicity is correlated with longer i.v. half-life. The Merck paper linked to above also noted that increasing lipophilicity can be a way to extend half-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in that paper, the Genentech team also did an extensive matched-molecular-pairs analysis, and they found a number of transformations that have a good probability of extending half-life (and they’re similar to the earlier paper). Nitrile to fluoroalkyl, methyl to fluorinated methyl, H to CF3, and tetrahydropyran to phenyl all have a good shot. In general, improving clearance in the rat hepatocyte assay has about a 67% chance of helping your half-life, and if you can do that without decreasing lipophilicity, you have an 82% shot. (I would guess that many of those are fluorinations and chlorinations). Just lowering the LogD, on the other hand, only works about 30% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait”, you may be saying. “If I start halogenating my compound, its solubility will probably go to pieces and its off-target binding may well go up!” This, in those deal-with-the-devil stories, is the point where the mysterious stranger slips up and his business partner catches a glimpse of his cloven feet. That is exactly the sort of deal being offered by pharmacokinetics and compound property analysis: no free lunch has yet been delivered. You have to make these changes in full knowledge that helping one aspect of the compound’s behavior may well hurt another one, and proceed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis (as the paper notes) doesn’t deal with charged compounds; they’re a whole other subject. And it also doesn’t go into the other ways around these problems, such as slow-release formulations, etc. But discovery-phase projects generally aren’t thinking about those things either – they’re trying to get compound behavior that doesn’t need the extra work later on. So if you’re in that part of the business, the advice from this paper is to pay attention to hepatocyte clearance assays, don’t be afraid to keep your lipophilicity where it is (or even raise it a bit, while watching for potential trouble), and don’t assume that just making the compound more polar is going to fix much of anything. And pay attention to metabolic hot spots – those are a big reason why those halogenations keep working  in these analyses. It’s more work to do metabolite ID, and often more difficult, chemically, to address those problems than it is to make general polarity changes. But it’s time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/489?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/489?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/489.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Hidding, B.</name></author><published>1525369184000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Sonochemistry of silicon hydrides</title><crawled>1525371040808</crawled><fingerprint>6039fce1</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/489?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1632732f428:e33ba6:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4340.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/4340</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Hui Li, Bohan Zhang, Xueguang Lu, Xuyu Tan, Fei Jia, Yue Xiao, Zehong Cheng, Yang Li, Dagoberto O.

Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process.

The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks.

Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197277</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gitta Kleijn, Birgit I.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease and one of the leading causes of disability in young adults. Functional markers able to predict MS progression are still lacking. It is recognized that olfactory dysfunction may be an early symptom in MS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether alterations in olfactory event-related potentials could play a prognostic role in MS. Thirty patients affected by MS relapsing-remitting underwent an olfactory potential examination (T0). Three years after baseline (T1), 28 of 30 patients were clinically evaluated by expanded disability status scale. In addition, the number of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) and the total number of relapses occurred in the last 3 years were collected. At T1, we observed a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and expanded disability status scale scores (rpb = -0.48; p = 0.009). A significant trend for a negative correlation between presence/absence of olfactory potentials and disease duration (rpb = -0.36; p = 0.06) and total number of relapses (rpb = -0.34; p = 0.08) was found. Only patients with olfactory potential absence showed a significant trend in the difference of the disability status scale (p = 0.06) between T0 and T1. In the sub-group of patients with reduced olfactory potential amplitude, we detected a trend for a negative correlation between the disability status scale and the amplitude of N1-P2 components more marked at T1 (r = -0.52; p = 0.06) than T0 (r = -0.47; p = 0.09). This is the first study that evaluated the prognostic role of olfactory event-related potentials in MS. Our results highlighted that olfactory alterations of MS patients were related to disability progression and, to a lesser extent, disease activity. The analysis of olfactory potential parameters confirmed the involvement in olfactory network damage of inflammatory and/or neurodegeneration processes which could predict the progressive course of the disease.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196006</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344161:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rosella Ciurleo, Lilla Bonanno, Simona De Salvo, Laura Romeo, Carmela Rifici, Edoardo Sessa, Giangaetano D’Aleo, Margherita Russo, Placido Bramanti, Silvia Marino, Fabrizia Caminiti&lt;/p&gt;

Furthermore, by using WGS for coordinating surveillance and to create a more fundamental understanding of the outcome of antimicrobial treatment and AMR mechanisms, we can use current and future antimicrobials more effectively and aim to extend their longevity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>11</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197009</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197009</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><published>1525294800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: Time- and depth-wise trophic niche shifts in Antarctic benthos</title><updated>1525294800000</updated><crawled>1525283103998</crawled><fingerprint>3db1e05c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197009</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197009</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a19a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303396v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/20/303396</canonicalUrl><author><name>Pique, D.</name></author><published>1524207600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>A novel approach to modeling transcriptional heterogeneity identifies the oncogene candidate CBX2 in invasive breast carcinoma [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1524272834750</crawled><fingerprint>4302146a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303396v1?rss=1</originId><description>Oncogenes promote the development of and serve as therapeutic targets against subsets of cancers.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197344</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b82:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475066:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

A structural-bioinformatics-based computational methodology and framework have been developed for the design of antibodies to targets of interest. RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>83</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8c:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jared Adolf-Bryfogle, Oleks Kalyuzhniy, Michael Kubitz, Brian D.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Appropriate demand for, and supply of, high quality essential neonatal care is key to improving newborn survival but evaluating such provision has received limited attention in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; July 2014 and 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (&amp;lt;50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d751:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Georgina A.

Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; July 2014 and 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (&amp;lt;50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04082-2</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/FYPDH_lHnzw/s41467-018-04082-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mina Ali</name></author><published>1524639600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>The multiple myeloma risk allele at 5q15 lowers ELL2 expression and increases ribosomal gene expression</title><crawled>1524648160159</crawled><fingerprint>9c7acd34</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04082-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The multiple myeloma risk allele at 5q15 lowers &lt;i&gt;ELL2&lt;/i&gt; expression and increases ribosomal gene expression&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multiple myeloma risk allele at 5q15 lowers &amp;lt;i&gt;ELL2&amp;lt;/i&gt; expression and increases ribosomal gene expression, Published online: 25 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04082-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04082-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;ELL2 was recently discovered as a susceptibility gene for multiple myeloma (MM).

Background &lt;p&gt;We investigated the effects of multiple-modality exercise with additional mind-motor training on cognition in community-dwelling older adults with subjective cognitive complaints.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 127, mean age 67.5 [7.3] years, 71% women) were randomized to receive 45 minutes of multiple-modality exercise with additional 15 minutes of either mind-motor training (M4, n = 63) or control (balance, range of motion and breathing exercises [M2, n = 64]). In total, both groups exercised 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 24 weeks. Standardized global cognitive functioning (GCF), concentration, reasoning, planning, and memory were assessed at 24 weeks and after a 28-week no-contact follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in the study primary outcomes. The M4 group, however, showed trends for greater improvements in GCF and memory (both, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .07) compared to the M2 group at 24 weeks. Significant differences between group in GCF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .03) and memory (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .02) were observed after the 28-week no-contact follow-up favouring the M4 group.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Additional mind-motor training did not impart immediate greater benefits to cognition among the study participants.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196356</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae69:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Narlon Cassio Boa Sorte Silva, Dawn P.

In mountainous landscapes, soil moisture is highly dynamic due to the effects of topography and the temporal variability imposed by seasonal precipitation, including rainfall and snow. Soil moisture is known to affect ecosystem carbon exchange both aboveground and belowground, as well as the stable isotopic composition of exchanged CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this study we used an extensive suite of measurements to examine the effects of seasonal changes in soil moisture on the isotopic composition of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production at the landscape level. We show that the seasonal decline in soil moisture (i.e., summer dry-down) appeared to impose a trend in the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C of soil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production (δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;) with more negative δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; early in the growing season when soils were wet, and more positive δ&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; as the growing season progressed and soils dried out. This seemingly generalizable pattern for a snow-dominated watershed is likely to represent the variability of recently assimilated C, tracked through the plant-soil system and imprinted in the respired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197355</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ee:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197489</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bb:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

The HIV-1 nucleocapsid 7 (NCp7) plays crucial roles in multiple stages of HIV-1 life cycle, and its biological functions rely on the binding of zinc ions. Understanding the molecular mechanism of how the zinc ions modulate the conformational dynamics and functions of the NCp7 is essential for the drug development and HIV-1 treatment. In this work, using a structure-based coarse-grained model, we studied the effects of zinc cofactors on the folding and target RNA(SL3) recognition of the NCp7 by molecular dynamics simulations. After reproducing some key properties of the zinc binding and folding of the NCp7 observed in previous experiments, our simulations revealed several interesting features in the metal ion modulated folding and target recognition. Firstly, we showed that the zinc binding makes the folding transition states of the two zinc fingers less structured, which is in line with the Hammond effect observed typically in mutation, temperature or denaturant induced perturbations to protein structure and stability. Secondly, We showed that there exists mutual interplay between the zinc ion binding and NCp7-target recognition. Binding of zinc ions enhances the affinity between the NCp7 and the target RNA, whereas the formation of the NCp7-RNA complex reshapes the intrinsic energy landscape of the NCp7 and increases the stability and zinc affinity of the two zinc fingers. Thirdly, by characterizing the effects of salt concentrations on the target RNA recognition, we showed that the NCp7 achieves optimal balance between the affinity and binding kinetics near the physiologically relevant salt concentrations. In addition, the effects of zinc binding on the inter-domain conformational flexibility and folding cooperativity of the NCp7 were also discussed.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196662</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a65:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Weitong Ren, Dongqing Ji, Xiulian Xu&lt;/p&gt;

The study of visual perception has largely been completed without regard to the influence that an individual’s emotional status may have on their performance in visual tasks. However, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mood may affect not only creative abilities and interpersonal skills but also the capacity to perform low-level cognitive tasks. Here, we sought to determine whether rudimentary visual search processes are similarly affected by emotion. Specifically, we examined whether an individual’s perceived happiness level affects their ability to detect a target in noise. To do so, we employed pop-out and serial visual search paradigms, implemented using a novel smartphone application that allowed search times and self-rated levels of happiness to be recorded throughout each twenty-four-hour period for two weeks. This experience sampling protocol circumvented the need to alter mood artificially with laboratory-based induction methods. Using our smartphone application, we were able to replicate the classic visual search findings, whereby pop-out search times remained largely unaffected by the number of distractors whereas serial search times increased with increasing number of distractors. While pop-out search times were unaffected by happiness level, serial search times with the maximum numbers of distractors (n = 30) were significantly faster for high happiness levels than low happiness levels (p = 0.02). Our results demonstrate the utility of smartphone applications in assessing ecologically valid measures of human visual performance. We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195865</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344158:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Toru Maekawa, Stephen J.

We discuss the significance of our findings for the assessment of basic visual functions using search time measures, and for our ability to search effectively for targets in real world settings.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23722-7</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/2uvN4ywuaZU/s41598-018-23722-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Wei Sun</name></author><published>1523948400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Author Correction: Dmrt1 is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis</title><crawled>1523949665448</crawled><fingerprint>bc63fbab</fingerprint><unread>False</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23722-7</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &amp;lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&amp;lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &amp;lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23722-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23722-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2uvN4ywuaZU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162d27a7ca8:2fa44d9:34f43e70</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &amp;lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&amp;lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &amp;lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 17 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23722-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23722-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Dmrt1&lt;/i&gt; is required for primary male sexual differentiation in Chinese soft-shelled turtle &lt;i&gt;Pelodiscus sinensis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2uvN4ywuaZU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23722-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006129</link><recrawled>1525812124141</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/gAxRWv6Wb-g/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Catherine M.

Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection face a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV-1. This is thought to be due to herpetic lesions serving as entry points for HIV-1 and tissue-resident CD4+ T cell counts increasing during HSV-2 lesional events. We have created a stochastic and spatial mathematical model describing the dynamics of HSV-2 infection and immune response in the genital mucosa. Using our model, we first study the dynamics of a developing HSV-2 lesion. We then use our model to quantify the risk of infection with HIV-1 following sexual exposure in HSV-2 positive women. Untreated, we find that HSV-2 infected women are up to 8.6 times more likely to acquire HIV-1 than healthy patients. However, when including the effects of the HSV-2 antiviral drug, pritelivir, the risk of HIV-1 infection is predicted to decrease by up to 35%, depending on drug dosage. We estimate the relative importance of decreased tissue damage versus decreased CD4+ cell presence in determining the effectiveness of pritelivir in reducing HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of pritelivir or similar agents in preventing HIV-1 infection in HSV-2 positive women.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAxRWv6Wb-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>7</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5e:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine M.

The addition of 5hmC improves model performance for tissues with high-levels of 5hmC such as the brain. Our analysis further indicates that conversion of 5mC to 5hmC within 2kb of the transcription start site associates with distinct functions depending on the summed level of 5mC + 5hmC. Unchanged levels of 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. conversion from 5mC to stable 5hmC) associate with repression. Meanwhile, decreases in 5mC + 5hmC (i.e. 5hmC-mediated demethylation) associate with gene activation.

Natural forests in inland China are generally distributed in montane area and secondary due to a semi-arid climate and past anthropogenic disturbances. However, quantification of carbon (C) stock in these forests and the role of altitude in determining C storage and its partition among ecosystem components are unclear. We sampled 54 stands of three secondary coniferous forests (&lt;i&gt;Larix principis-rupprechtii&lt;/i&gt; (LP) forest, &lt;i&gt;Picea meyerii&lt;/i&gt; (PM) forest and &lt;i&gt;Pinus tabulaeformis&lt;/i&gt; (PT) forest) on Loess Plateau in an altitudinal range of 1200-2700m a.s.l. C stocks of tree layer, shrub layer, herb layer, coarse wood debris, forest floor and soil were estimated. We found these forests had relatively high total C stocks. Driven by both higher vegetation and soil C stocks, total C stocks of LP and PM forests in the high altitudinal range were 375.0 and 368.4 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, significantly higher than that of PT forest in the low altitudinal range (230.2 t C ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, understory shrubs accounted for about 20% of total biomass in PT forest. The proportions of vegetation to total C stock were similar among in the three forests (below 45%), so were the proportions of soil C stock (over 54%). Necromass C stocks were also similar among these forests, but their proportions to total C stock were significantly lower in LP and PM forests (1.4% and 1.6%) than in PT forest (3.0%). Across forest types, vegetation biomass and soil C stock simultaneously increased with increasing altitude, causing fairly unchanged C partitioning among ecosystem components along the altitudinal gradient. Soil C stock also increased with altitude in LP and PT forests. Forest floor necromass decreased with increasing altitude across the three forests. Our results suggest the important role of the altitudinal gradient in C sequestration and floor necromass of these three forests in terms of alleviated water conditions and in soil C storage of LP and PM forests in terms of temperature change.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196927</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af0:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ning Liu, Hongwei Nan&lt;/p&gt;

Touch is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic sensations such as mechanical itch (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the touch receptors in the skin.

Touch is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic sensations such as mechanical itch (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the touch receptors in the skin. Targeted genetic deletion of Merkel cells and associated mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels in the skin was sufficient to produce alloknesis.

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16317a3def5:127149:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by David R.

By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006085</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><published>1525726800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: Proposing a validated clinical app predicting hospitalization cost for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery</title><updated>1525726800000</updated><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><fingerprint>627d5dbc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197200</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42272:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ruben D.

The present study investigated the interplay between selective inhibition (the ability to suppress specific competing responses) and nonselective inhibition (the ability to suppress any inappropriate response) during single word production. To this end, we combined two well-established research paradigms: the picture-word interference task and the stop-signal task. Selective inhibition was assessed by instructing participants to name target pictures (e.g., dog) in the presence of semantically related (e.g., cat) or unrelated (e.g., window) distractor words. Nonselective inhibition was tested by occasionally presenting a visual stop-signal, indicating that participants should withhold their verbal response. The stop-signal was presented early (250 ms) aimed at interrupting the lexical selection stage, and late (325 ms) to influence the word-encoding stage of the speech production process. We found longer naming latencies for pictures with semantically related distractors than with unrelated distractors (semantic interference effect). The results further showed that, at both delays, stopping latencies (i.e., stop-signal RTs) were prolonged for naming pictures with semantically related distractors compared to pictures with unrelated distractors. Taken together, our findings suggest that selective and nonselective inhibition, at least partly, share a common inhibitory mechanism during different stages of the speech production process.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197313</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163501fadb1:1dba0ea:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruben D.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05).

L-Proline is a multifunctional amino acid that plays an essential role in primary metabolism and physiological functions. Proline is oxidized to glutamate in the mitochondria and the FAD-containing enzyme proline oxidase (PO) catalyzes the first step in L-proline degradation pathway. Alterations in proline metabolism have been described in various human diseases, such as hyperprolinemia type I, velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Di George syndrome, schizophrenia and cancer. In particular, the mutation giving rise to the substitution &lt;i&gt;Leu441Pro&lt;/i&gt; was identified in patients suffering of schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia type I. Here, we report on the expression of wild-type and &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variants of human PO in a U87 glioblastoma human cell line in an attempt to assess their effect on glutamate metabolism. The subcellular localization of the flavoenzyme is not altered in the &lt;i&gt;L441P&lt;/i&gt; variant, for which specific activity is halved compared to the wild-type PO. While this decrease in activity is significantly less than that previously proposed, an effect of the substitution on the enzyme stability is also apparent in our studies. At 24 hours of growth from transient transfection, the intracellular level of proline, glutamate, and glutamine is decreased in cells expressing the PO variants as compared to control U87 cells, reaching a similar figure at 72 h. On the other hand, the extracellular levels of the three selected amino acids show a similar time course for all clones. Furthermore, PO overexpression does not modify to a significant extent the expression of GLAST and GLT-1 glutamate transporters. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the proline pathway links cellular proline levels with those of glutamate and glutamine. On this side, PO might play a regulatory role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by affecting the cellular concentration of glutamate.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196283</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162fde8fd2c:5d67ba:91749e5b</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pamela Cappelletti, Elena Tallarita, Valentina Rabattoni, Paola Campomenosi, Silvia Sacchi, Loredano Pollegioni&lt;/p&gt;

On this side, PO might play a regulatory role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by affecting the cellular concentration of glutamate.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/276?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/276?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/276.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Sekar, N., Clark, W., Dobson, A., Coelho, P.

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a914ef8:44b6aff:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196836</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6a:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Manuel Gálvez, Daniel Castillo, Luis Javier Herrera, Belén San Román, Olga Valenzuela, Francisco Manuel Ortuño, Ignacio Rojas&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study is aimed to evaluate the physiochemical properties and cytotoxicity of mercury-based formulation for the development of anticancer therapeuticals.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological features of the formulation were characterized by FE-SEM, XPS and EDS. The described formulation was evaluated for its cytotoxicity on Hek293 and MCF7 cell lines using MTT assay to study the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity was also studied on zebrafish embryos and the lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated as per the OECD regulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of mercuric compounds. The particles were spherical and stable with the size ranges between 20 and 80nm. Although the PK formulation contains mercurials it was very effective only to cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293). The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of developmental toxicity on zebrafish embryo confirmed the safer dosage of 100μg/ml.

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study is aimed to evaluate the physiochemical properties and cytotoxicity of mercury-based formulation for the development of anticancer therapeuticals.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological features of the formulation were characterized by FE-SEM, XPS and EDS. The described formulation was evaluated for its cytotoxicity on Hek293 and MCF7 cell lines using MTT assay to study the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity was also studied on zebrafish embryos and the lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values were calculated as per the OECD regulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The elemental and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of mercuric compounds. The particles were spherical and stable with the size ranges between 20 and 80nm. Although the PK formulation contains mercurials it was very effective only to cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293). The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of developmental toxicity on zebrafish embryo confirmed the safer dosage of 100μg/ml. However, a higher dosage of 1mg/ml led to the malformation of embryos such as pericardial, tail and yolk sac edema.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The physiochemical characterization of PK formulation confirmed the presence of HgS. The results of both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies showed that the formulation is less toxic. Although the test sample contains mercurials it was very effective against cancerous cells (MCF-7) and it is less toxic to normal cells (HEK 293).&lt;/p&gt; Future studies &lt;p&gt;Further studies on effectiveness of the formulation along with inflammatory response in mice models are to be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03977-4</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/km9zn8IHUCg/s41467-018-03977-4</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Christophe Jung</name></author><published>1524466800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>True equilibrium measurement of transcription factor-DNA binding affinities using automated polarization microscopy</title><crawled>1524474279371</crawled><fingerprint>e3740958</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03977-4</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;True equilibrium measurement of transcription factor-DNA binding affinities using automated polarization microscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True equilibrium measurement of transcription factor-DNA binding affinities using automated polarization microscopy, Published online: 23 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03977-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03977-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Methods to measure selective transcription factor-DNA binding often lack sensitivity and are not performed in solution.

A novel α-galactosidase of glycoside hydrolase family 36 was cloned from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/i&gt;, overexpressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and characterized. The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl-α-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 °C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 °C for 30 min, it retained &gt; 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0–10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, α-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in &amp;lt; 30 min.

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</content></content></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0055-9</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0055-9/MediaObjects/41586_2018_55_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>638</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>685</width></visual><author><name>Kevin P.

Methods and results &lt;p&gt;Treatment of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) with β-AR agonist (isoproterenol) for 15 min increased phosphorylation (serine-518) and sumoylation of NF2. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed β-AR-stimulated sumoylation of NF2. β-AR stimulation enhanced nuclear translocation of phosphorylated and sumoylated NF2. Specific inhibition of β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR and protein kinase A (PKA) decreased β-AR-stimulated increase in NF2 post-translational modifications, while inhibition of β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AR had no effect. Activation of adenylyl cyclase using forskolin (FSK) mimicked the effects of β-AR stimulation. β-AR stimulation and expression of wild-type (WT)-NF2 using adenoviruses increased phosphorylation of mammalian sterile like kinase-1/2 (MST1/2) and yes activated protein (YAP), downstream targets of NF2. Knockdown of NF2 using siRNA in H9C2 cardiomyocytes decreased β-AR-stimulated increase in NF2 and YAP phosphorylation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of NF2 decreased β-AR-stimulated increase in apoptosis, while expression of WT-NF2 induced apoptosis in ARVMs. Expression of WT-NF2 stimulated the mitochondrial death pathway as evidenced by activation of c-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs), and increase in cytosolic cytochrome c levels and Bax expression.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;β-AR stimulation affects post-translational modifications of NF2 via the involvement β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-AR/PKA/cAMP pathway, and NF2 plays a pro-apoptotic role in β-AR-stimulated myocyte apoptosis via the phosphorylation (inactivation) of YAP and involvement of mitochondrial death pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196626</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e55:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Suman Dalal, Barbara Connelly, Mahipal Singh, Krishna Singh&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper, an adaptive fractional order sliding mode control (AFSMC) scheme is designed for the current tracking control of the Boost-type converter in a Battery/Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). In order to stabilize the current, the adaptation rules based on state-observer and Lyapunov function are being designed. A fractional order sliding surface function is defined based on the tracking current error and adaptive rules. Furthermore, through fractional order analysis, the stability of the fractional order control system is proven, and the value of the fractional order (λ) is being investigated. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed AFSMC strategy is being verified by numerical simulations. The advantages of good transient response and robustness to uncertainty are being indicated by this design, when compared with a conventional integer order sliding mode control system.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196501</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d74d:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianlin Wang, Dan Xu, Huan Zhou, Tao Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:131f:910a81bb</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Breslin, John Joseph Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin, Bronac Flanagan, Harm Van Zalinge, Steve Hall, Matthew Walker, Alexei Verkhratsky, Liam McDaid&lt;/p&gt;

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197217</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

End-stage renal disease is strongly associated with progressive cardiovascular calcification (CVC) and there is currently no therapy targeted to treat CVC. SNF472 is an experimental formulation under development for treatment of soft tissue calcification. We have investigated the pharmacokinetics of SNF472 administration in rats and its inhibitory effects on CVC. SNF472 was studied in three rat models: (1) prevention of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with an intravenous SNF472 bolus of 1 mg/kg SNF472, (2) inhibition of progression of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-induced CVC with a subcutaneous SNF472 bolus of 10 or 60 mg/kg SNF472, starting after calcification induction, (3) CVC in adenine-induced uremic rats treated with 50 mg/kg SNF472 via i.v. 4h -infusion. Uremic rats presented lower plasma levels of SNF472 than control animals after i.v. infusion. CVC in non-uremic rats was inhibited by 60–70% after treatment with SNF472 and progression of cardiac calcification completely blocked. Development of CVC in uremic rats was inhibited by up to 80% following i.v. infusion of SNF472. SNF472 inhibits the development and progression of CVC in uremic and non-uremic rats in the same range of SNF472 plasma levels but using in each case the required dose to obtain those levels. These results collectively support the development of SNF472 as a novel therapeutic option for treatment of CVC in humans.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197061</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee0:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miguel D.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt;. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; at two concentrations tested. However, based on propidium iodide uptake, only NK2A and NK2C appeared capable of causing structural damage to &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that plasma membrane depolarization alone was insufficient to induce lethality, but disruption/permeabilization of the &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; plasma membrane was the cause of lethality.</content></content></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto</name></author><published>1525813200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Genome-wide association meta-analysis of circulating odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids: Results from the CHARGE Consortium</title><updated>1525813200000</updated><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><fingerprint>19a6a2ea</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto, Rozenn N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods. SNPs associated with C23:0 may reflect a role of genetic factors in the synthesis of sphingomyelin.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196951</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475058:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia C. de Oliveira Otto, Rozenn N.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;To assess the nationwide seasonal peaks, risk factors, and utilization of medical resources of respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospitalization (RSVH) in preterm infants in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;A Taiwan nationwide birth cohort was extracted from the Birth Certificate Application Database during 2007–2009 and prospectively linked to the National Health Insurance database. We evaluated the seasonal peaks and risk factors (gestational age [GA], chronologic age [CA], and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]) associated with the RSVH of preterm infants. The length of hospital stays (LOS), care in intensive care unit (ICU), and use of mechanical ventilation (MV) were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan, three seasonal peaks and two seasonal peaks of RSVH in preterm infants with BPD and without BPD, respectively. Preterm infants had significantly higher RSVH rate than term infants (2.6% vs 0.9%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants born at 29–35 weeks of gestational age (wGA) with BPD had significantly higher RSVH rate than those without BPD (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Preterm infants without BPD born at &amp;lt; 32 wGA had higher RSVH rate than those born at 33–35 wGA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Overall, 56.4% of RSVH occurred within 9 months of CA. Preterm infants with BPD had significantly higher ICU admission rate within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage within 12 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001) and LOS within 18 months of CA (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) than those without BPD. RSVH occurred within 6 months of CA was significantly associated with higher ICU admission rate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), MV usage (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002) and longer LOS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) in preterm infants without BPD.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a total duration of 9 months of RSVH season in Taiwan.

These results suggest an intertwined molecular signaling network that affects biological time across multiple temporal scales in response to environmental stimuli and available resources.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00172</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/oiN796Yul0U/acs.biochem.8b00172</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ruth Cohen-Khait, Gideon Schreiber</name></author><published>1524801600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00172/20180426/images/medium/bi-2018-00172v_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00172&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Pathogen load determines the outcome of many infections, and is a consequence of pathogen multiplication rate, duration of the infection, and inhibition or killing of pathogen by the host (resistance). If these determinants of pathogen load could be quantified then their mechanistic correlates might be determined. In humans the timing of infection is rarely known and treatment cannot usually be withheld to monitor serial changes in pathogen load and host response. Here we present an approach to overcome this and identify potential mechanisms of resistance which control parasite load in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using a mathematical model of longitudinal infection dynamics for orientation, we made individualized estimates of parasite multiplication and growth inhibition in Gambian children at presentation with acute malaria and used whole blood RNA-sequencing to identify their correlates. We identified novel roles for secreted proteases cathepsin G and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) as direct effector molecules which inhibit P. falciparum growth. Cathepsin G acts on the erythrocyte membrane, cleaving surface receptors required for parasite invasion, whilst MMP9 acts on the parasite. In contrast, the type 1 interferon response and expression of CXCL10 (IFN-{gamma}-inducible protein of 10 kDa, IP-10) were detrimental to control of parasite growth. Natural variation in iron status and plasma levels of complement factor H were determinants of parasite multiplication rate. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for the dynamic interaction between host and pathogen when seeking to identify correlates of protection, and reveal novel mechanisms controlling parasite growth in humans. This approach could be extended to identify additional mechanistic correlates of natural- and vaccine-induced immunity to malaria and other infections.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321463v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d41:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Improved methods are needed to identify host mechanisms which directly protect against human infectious diseases in order to develop better vaccines and therapeutics.

Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196746</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a18c:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by J.

Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b4:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197523</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7be:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Taek Lim, Chan Heun Park, Sung Yong Kim, Seok Jin Nam, Eun Young Kang, Byung-In Moon, Hyouk Jin Lee, Ye Won Jeon, Hongki Gwak, Young Jin Suh&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model to study various biological phenomenon. During &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The &lt;i&gt;decapentaplegic (dpp)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, the targeted &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new &lt;i&gt;dpp-&lt;/i&gt;Gal4 lines, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 and &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 with existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. It suggests that misexpression studies along MF needs revisiting using the new Gal4 drivers generated in our studies.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196365</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d746:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ankita Sarkar, Neha Gogia, Kevin Farley, Lydia Payton, Amit Singh&lt;/p&gt;

Altogether, reproducible prediction of cell type compositions using LDA opens up possibilities to analyse large cohort studies based on mass cytometry data.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Daniel Finkelstein-Shapiro</name></author><published>1525931992000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><fingerprint>fa0d6613</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019376?af=R</originId><title>Two-dimensional Fano lineshapes: Excited-state absorption contributions</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccc1:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.2.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Stress granule transcription</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>96ddfc2</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ce:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yuanyuan Sun</name></author><published>1524603600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Nitrogen diagnosis based on dynamic characteristics of rice leaf image</title><updated>1524603600000</updated><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><fingerprint>7bc6fc75</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;
Digital image processing is widely used in the non-destructive diagnosis of plant nutrition. Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific “dynamic features.” According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196298</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fa8:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197541</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c0:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;

I say that because I’ve been actively reading the chemical literature for over thirty years now, and I still keep running across topics that I never knew existed. One of these popped up the other day: racemic protein crystallography. Now there may be a few readers who are all “Oh yeah, sure, you’re just getting around to that?”, but for everyone else, think about that term for a minute. Prepare yourself for a weird excursion into chirality and crystallinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein crystallography, sure – great stuff, although known to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/04/05/more-on-crystal-formation-this-time-with-proteins&quot;&gt;infested with voodoo&lt;/a&gt; and all that. But racemic? The idea of a racemic protein is a bit weird, because that means a 50/50 mix of enantiomers, and proteins are, of course, pretty much all made up of the naturally (L) amino acids that living cells use crank them out. To get an all (D) protein, you’d have to have a supply of all those unnatural enantiomeric amino acids (which you can buy, albeit not so cheaply). But you’re not going to be able to depend on any cells or ribosomes to make them for you, since we don’t have any mirror-image life handy, so chemical synthesis it is. And that’s doable, too (although the larger the protein chain, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2006/07/19/fuzeons_fallout&quot;&gt;trickier&lt;/a&gt; it gets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next question you might have is why anyone would want to go to all the trouble. And there we get into some crystallography. If you look at all the basic ways that things can be arranged in three dimensions, with careful attention to what directions and how you’d have to move your basic units around to make them repeat, you are listing “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group&quot;&gt;space groups&lt;/a&gt;“. And here chemistry (and physics) impinge on pure mathematics, because good ol’ three-dimensional space has &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_groups&quot;&gt;230 different space groups&lt;/a&gt;: that’s all there are and there ain’t no more. There are several different ways to arrange them and more than several notations for them, as that last link will show you, but mathematically, that’s what we have to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sit around your whole career crystallizing things, you will eventually encounter every single one of them, although (to be sure) there are definitely more and less common ones. But if you do nothing but crystallize proteins, you poor person you, then you will only encounter 65 of them at most. Those are the chiral space groups that don’t have any of the slightly fancier symmetries in them, such as inversion centers or mirror reflections, because chiral protein chains simply cannot be arranged in ways that will allow those things to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as it turns out, if you look at all the protein crystals known and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb1295-1062&quot;&gt;bin them out&lt;/a&gt; into those 65 space groups, the &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; group is pretty heavily over-represented, and a few others are right behind it. That link goes into what seems like the explanation: entropy. Those space groups allow for more degrees of freedom, which means that there are (in most cases) simply more opportunities for proteins to fall into that sort of pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you were to go to racemic proteins and crystallize those, you end up with 165 possible space groups, which means that crystallization should, in fact, be easier in general (since there are more ways for it to happen). And since protein crystallization (as it stands) can be a barren wasteland of heartbreak, this is good news. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101123&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; for globular proteins are that about 30% of them can be crystallized through brute-force experimentation, but only about two-thirds of those crystals, at best, give enough high-quality diffraction data to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-biophys-050511-102333&quot;&gt;really does look&lt;/a&gt; like the success rates for racemic crystallization are higher: greater than 85%, actually, which is just unheard of. An outstanding example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitin&quot;&gt;ubiquitin&lt;/a&gt;, a relatively small and very biologically important protein that is a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; pain to crystallize. Its structure &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283687906796?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;was determined&lt;/a&gt; in 1987, but as I understand it, almost everyone who studied its crystalline form since then did so by obtaining seed crystals from that original successful team (!) Synthesis of the enantiomeric protein made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/chem.201600101&quot;&gt;dramatic difference&lt;/a&gt;: a standard screen of protein crystallization conditions on the racemate &lt;em&gt;gave diffraction quality crystals in half the wells after an overnight run&lt;/em&gt;. Recently it was shown that this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.6b09545&quot;&gt;even applies to&lt;/a&gt; ubiquitin oligomers, which have been considered particularly intractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The racemic-protein idea was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/342133a0&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; in 1989 and first &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.340160308&quot;&gt;achieved&lt;/a&gt; in 1993, and it’s been gathering momentum ever since. The same paper that explained the current protein space group bias predicted, through the same considerations, which new space group(s) would become the most favored as more racemic proteins were studied and according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968089617304807&quot;&gt;this recent review&lt;/a&gt;, they’re right on target (between 40 and 50 examples are known to date). The prediction was also made that membrane-bound proteins might be difficult, since they have fewer protein-protein contact points than soluble proteins tend to. Work in this area is still at an early stage, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629355/&quot;&gt;so far&lt;/a&gt; it looks like you can get X-ray structures for such things, but that they might differ (on a macro subunit-assembly level) from what occurs in the real membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all great if you can get past the brutal synthesis part, and that last review and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593117302260&quot;&gt;this shorter recent overview&lt;/a&gt; go into that issue. What’s really made the difference in recent years is “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_chemical_ligation&quot;&gt;native chemical ligation&lt;/a&gt;” chemistry on shorter (and unprotected) protein subunits. It’s still not something you undertake lightly, but it’s a lot more feasible than it used to be. And that’s a good thing: protein crystal data is extremely useful (although not quite the Word of God in all situations) and anything that allows us to get more of it, particularly in the tough cases, is welcome indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum:&lt;/em&gt; I can’t resist noting the first time I ever came across the idea of a fully enantiomeric protein, which was when I was about 14 years old and reading James Blish’s (rather odd) one-off short Star Trek novel, &lt;em&gt;Spock Must Die&lt;/em&gt;. Blish (as always) couldn’t resist working his own interests into it, so you have oddities like Uhura being a devotee of James Joyce and &lt;em&gt;Finnegan’s Wake&lt;/em&gt; in particular, which raised my eyebrows, Spock-like, even as a 14-year-old. At any rate, a key plot point is the emergency trial of a souped-up long range transporter beam that sends a copy of the person involved. Spock gets into the thing – mind you, they should have tried it on a box lunch of roast beef sandwiches or something first, but that’s the 1960s &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; – and the beam ends up unexpectedly reflecting back and producing an apparently identical Spock, to great consternation, not least because there’s some confusion about which one is the original. One of the two ends up barricading himself inside Dr. McCoy’s laboratories for reasons unknown, and when they discover that he’s the duplicate, one proof is that they find that he’s been in there &lt;em&gt;synthesizing enantiomeric proteins and carbohydrates&lt;/em&gt; in order to survive. That reflection reversed him down to his molecular chirality, you see, so. . .&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>10</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019805?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019805?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Yasuhiro Ikabata</name></author><published>1526016235000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1526282826472</crawled><fingerprint>f9b30d38</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5019805?af=R</originId><title>Quantum chemical approach for positron annihilation spectra of atoms and molecules beyond plane-wave approximation</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1635d8bb2e8:2d2ccc5:3dd877af</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04202-y</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/eY5pFM9xGpk/s41467-018-04202-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Freek Ruesink</name></author><published>1525417200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Optical circulation in a multimode optomechanical resonator</title><crawled>1525425941977</crawled><fingerprint>294e2e00</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04202-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optical circulation in a multimode optomechanical resonator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optical circulation in a multimode optomechanical resonator, Published online: 04 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04202-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04202-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nonreciprocal optical elements mostly rely on magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry, an approach that is difficult to integrate on-chip.

The neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC/NTRK3) has been described as a dependence receptor and, as such, triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand NT-3. This proapoptotic activity has been proposed to confer a tumor suppressor activity to this classic tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK). By investigating interacting partners that might facilitate TrkC-induced cell death, we have identified the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Hey1 and importin-α3 (karyopherin alpha 4 [KPNA4]) as direct interactors of TrkC intracellular domain, and we show that Hey1 is required for TrkC-induced apoptosis. We propose here that the cleaved proapoptotic portion of TrkC intracellular domain (called TrkC killer-fragment [TrkC-KF]) is translocated to the nucleus by importins and interacts there with Hey1. We also demonstrate that Hey1 and TrkC-KF transcriptionally silence mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), thus contributing to p53 stabilization. p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of TrkC-KF cytoplasmic and mitochondrial interactors cofactor of breast cancer 1 (COBRA1) and B cell lymphoma 2–associated X (BAX), which will subsequently trigger the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Of interest, TrkC was proposed to constrain tumor progression in neuroblastoma (NB), and we demonstrate in an avian model that TrkC tumor suppressor activity requires Hey1 and p53.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/k59-VYZP8r0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163504e3b90:46b3f2:f3bf0074</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Ménard, Clélia Costechareyre, Gabriel Ichim, Jonathan Blachier, David Neves, Loraine Jarrosson-Wuilleme, Reinhard Depping, Jan Koster, Pierre Saintigny, Patrick Mehlen, Servane Tauszig-Delamasure&lt;/p&gt;

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>232</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16341bada2e:5f868a:3dd877af</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003705</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197099</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197099</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Linnea Bärebring</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Sociodemographic factors associated with reported attempts at weight loss and specific dietary regimens in Sweden: The SWEDIET-2017 study</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><fingerprint>e982054f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197099</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;
The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197099</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155914e:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass.

To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass. Further work is needed to grasp the virulence and fitness mechanisms adopted by &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; causing APN, and hence develop new therapeutic and prophylactic approaches.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006100</link><recrawled>1525887730160</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HxEjp5eCvBA/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gonçalo M.

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>6</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16345fc905e:1b81bb5:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M.

The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contents in the environment have been rising due to human activities. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels have been shown to affect plant physiology and soil microbes, which may alter the degradation of organic pollutants. Here, we study the effect of eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on PAH accumulation in a paddy soil grown with rice. We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function. Elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; changed the composition of soil microbial communities, especially by reducing the abundance of some microbial groups driving PAH degradation. Our study indicates that elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels may weaken the self-cleaning ability of soils related to organic pollutants. Such changes in the function of soil microbial communities may threaten the quality of crops, with unknown implications for food safety and human health in future climate scenarios.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196439</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb8:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fuxun Ai, Nico Eisenhauer, Yuwei Xie, Jianguo Zhu, Alexandre Jousset, Wenchao Du, Ying Yin, Xiaowei Zhang, Rong Ji, Hongyan Guo&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;In a study conducted in Bhopal district (a setting with facility for molecular drug susceptibility testing (DST)) located in central India in 2014–15, we found high levels of pre-diagnosis attrition among patients with presumptive multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)–meaning TB patients who were eligible for DST, were not being tested.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the health care provider perspectives into barriers and suggested solutions for improving DST.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a descriptive qualitative study. One to one interviews (n = 10) and focus group discussions (n = 2) with experienced key informants involved in programmatic management of DR-TB were conducted in April 2017. Manual descriptive thematic analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The key barriers reported were a) lack of or delay in identification of patients eligible for DST because of using treatment register as the source for identifying patients b) lack of assured specimen transport after patient identification and c) lack of tracking. Extra pulmonary TB patients were not getting identified as eligible for DST. Solutions suggested by the health care providers were i) generation of unique identifier at identification in designated microscopy center (DMC), immediate intimation of unique identifier to district and regular monitoring by senior TB laboratory and senior treatment supervisors of patients eligible for DST that were missed; ii) documentation of unique identifier at each step of cascade; iii) use of human carriers/couriers to transport specimen from DMCs especially in rural areas; and iv) routine entry of all presumptive extra-pulmonary TB specimen, as far as possible, in DMC laboratory register.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Lack of assured specimen transport and lack of accountability for tracking patient after identification and referral were the key barriers. The identification of patients eligible for DST among microbiologically confirmed TB at the time of diagnosis and among clinically confirmed TB at the time of treatment initiation is the key. Use of unique identifier at identification and its use to ensure cohort wise tracking has to be complemented with specimen transport support and prompt feedback to the DMC. The study has implications to improve detection of MDR-TB among diagnosed/notified TB patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196162</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e803:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hemant Deepak Shewade, Arun M.

The highly similar prokaryotic DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferases (C5-MTases) M.MpeI and M.SssI share the specificity of eukaryotic C5-MTases (5’-CG), and can be useful research tools in the study of eukaryotic DNA methylation and epigenetic regulation. In an effort to improve the stability and solubility of complementing fragments of the two MTases, genes encoding circularly permuted (CP) variants of M.MpeI and M.SssI were created, and cloned in a plasmid vector downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter. MTase activity of the CP variants was tested by digestion of the plasmids with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes. Eleven of the fourteen M.MpeI permutants and six of the seven M.SssI permutants had detectable MTase activity as indicated by the full or partial protection of the plasmid carrying the cpMTase gene. Permutants cp62M.MpeI and cp58M.SssI, in which the new N-termini are located between conserved motifs II and III, had by far the highest activity. The activity of cp62M.MpeI was comparable to the activity of wild-type M.MpeI. Based on the location of the split sites, the permutants possessing MTase activity can be classified in ten types. Although most permutation sites were designed to fall outside of conserved motifs, and the MTase activity of the permutants measured in cell extracts was in most cases substantially lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, the high proportion of circular permutation topologies compatible with MTase activity is remarkable, and is a new evidence for the structural plasticity of C5-MTases. A computer search of the REBASE database identified putative C5-MTases with CP arrangement. Interestingly, all natural circularly permuted C5-MTases appear to represent only one of the ten types of permutation topology created in this work.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197232</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pál Albert, Bence Varga, Nikolett Zsibrita, Antal Kiss&lt;/p&gt;

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197392</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b5:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Yan, Guilin Li, Xingqi Guo, Yang Li, Xuecheng Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197052</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b42267:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sruti S.

Large marine protected areas (LMPAs) are increasingly being established and have a high profile in marine conservation. LMPAs are expected to achieve multiple objectives, and because of their size are postulated to avoid trade-offs that are common in smaller MPAs. However, evaluations across multiple outcomes are lacking. We used a systematic approach to code several social and ecological outcomes of 12 LMPAs. We found evidence of three types of trade-offs: trade-offs between different ecological resources (supply trade-offs); trade-offs between ecological resource conditions and the well-being of resource users (supply-demand trade-offs); and trade-offs between the well-being outcomes of different resource users (demand trade-offs). We also found several divergent outcomes that were attributed to influences beyond the scope of the LMPA. We suggest that despite their size, trade-offs can develop in LMPAs and should be considered in planning and design. LMPAs may improve their performance across multiple social and ecological objectives if integrated with larger-scale conservation efforts.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195760</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb2:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tammy E.

Cerebral autoregulation (CA) is the complex homeostatic regulatory relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). This study aimed to analyze the frequency-specific coupling function between cerebral oxyhemoglobin concentrations (delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) signals based on a model of coupled phase oscillators and dynamical Bayesian inference. Delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] was measured by 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and arterial BP signals were obtained by simultaneous resting-state measurements in patients with stroke, that is, 9 with left hemiparesis (L–H group), 8 with right hemiparesis (R–H group), and 17 age-matched healthy individuals as control (healthy group). The coupling functions from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] oscillators were identified and analyzed in four frequency intervals (I, 0.6–2 Hz; II, 0.145–0.6 Hz; III, 0.052–0.145 Hz; and IV, 0.021–0.052 Hz). In L–H group, the CS from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in interval III in channel 8 was significantly higher than that in healthy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003). Compared with the healthy controls, the coupling in MAP→delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] showed higher amplitude in interval I and IV in patients with stroke. The increased CS and coupling amplitude may be an evidence of impairment in CA, thereby confirming the presence of impaired CA in patients with stroke. In interval III, the CS in L–H group from MAP to delta [HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in channel 16 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) was significantly lower than that in healthy controls, which might indicate the compensatory mechanism in CA of the unaffected side in patients with stroke. No significant difference in region-wise CS between affected and unaffected sides was observed in stroke groups, indicating an evidence of globally impaired CA. These findings provide a method for the assessment of CA and will contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in stroke patients.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195936</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbb:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honglun Su, Congcong Huo, Bitian Wang, Wenhao Li, Gongcheng Xu, Qianying Liu, Zengyong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue.

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids. Overall, the synthetic biology framework and tracking analysis in this work will provide a framework for investigating controlled motility of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and other ‘smart’ probiotics for signal-directed treatment.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-e?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-e?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/281.5.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Stajic, J.</name></author><published>1524159423000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Manipulating an antiferromagnet</title><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><fingerprint>e7c1cfde</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/281-e?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162df0c1301:449d69d:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315564v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/15/315564</canonicalUrl><author><name>Bhalla, S.</name></author><published>1526367600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>A web bench for analysis and prediction of oncological status from proteomics data of urine samples [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1526398537897</crawled><fingerprint>c8557914</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315564v1?rss=1</originId><description>Urine-based cancer biomarkers offer numerous advantages over the other biomarkers and play a crucial role in cancer management.

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b85:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163032286b6:a8a5f:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica Ausborn, Hidehiko Koizumi, William H.

Understanding the functional basis of auxin homeostasis requires knowledge about auxin biosynthesis, auxin transport and auxin catabolism genes, which is not always directly available despite the recent whole-genome sequencing of many plant species. Through sequence homology searches and phylogenetic analyses on a selection of 11 plant species with high-quality genome annotation, we identified the putative gene homologs involved in auxin biosynthesis, auxin catabolism and auxin transport pathways in carnation (&lt;i&gt;Dianthus caryophyllus&lt;/i&gt; L.). To deepen our knowledge of the regulatory events underlying auxin-mediated adventitious root formation in carnation stem cuttings, we used RNA-sequencing data to confirm the expression profiles of some auxin homeostasis genes during the rooting of two carnation cultivars with different rooting behaviors. We also confirmed the presence of several auxin-related metabolites in the stem cutting tissues. Our findings offer a comprehensive overview of auxin homeostasis genes in carnation and provide a solid foundation for further experiments investigating the role of auxin homeostasis in the regulation of adventitious root formation in carnation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196663</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e5c:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Belén Sánchez-García, Sergio Ibáñez, Antonio Cano, Manuel Acosta, José Manuel Pérez-Pérez&lt;/p&gt;

The innate immune system is paramount in the response to and clearance of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in non-immune individuals. Known factors include type I and III interferons and antiviral pathogen recognition receptors, and the cascades of antiviral and pro- and anti-inflammatory gene expression they induce. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly recognized to participate in post-transcriptional modulation of these responses, but the temporal dynamics of how these players of the antiviral innate immune response collaborate to combat infection remain poorly characterized. We quantified the expression of miRNAs and protein coding genes in the lungs of pigs 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with swine IAV (H1N2). Through RT-qPCR we observed a 400-fold relative increase in IFN-λ3 gene expression on day 1 after challenge, and a strong interferon-mediated antiviral response was observed on days 1 and 3 accompanied by up-regulation of genes related to the pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis. Using small RNA sequencing and qPCR validation we found 27 miRNAs that were differentially expressed after challenge, with the highest number of regulated miRNAs observed on day 3. In contrast, the number of protein coding genes found to be regulated due to IAV infection peaked on day 1. Pulmonary miRNAs may thus be aimed at fine-tuning the initial rapid inflammatory response after IAV infection. Specifically, we found five miRNAs (ssc-miR-15a, ssc-miR-18a, ssc-miR-21, ssc-miR-29b, and hsa-miR-590-3p)–four known porcine miRNAs and one novel porcine miRNA candidate–to be potential modulators of viral pathogen recognition and apoptosis. A total of 11 miRNAs remained differentially expressed 14 days after challenge, at which point the infection had cleared. In conclusion, the results suggested a role for miRNAs both during acute infection as well as later, with the potential to influence lung homeostasis and susceptibility to secondary infections in the lungs of pigs after IAV infection.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194765</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7ef:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louise Brogaard, Lars E.

Lipids are important structural and functional components of the skin. Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the &lt;i&gt;Fasn&lt;/i&gt; gene which encodes fatty acid synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs).

Lipids are important structural and functional components of the skin. Alterations in the lipid composition of the epidermis are associated with inflammation and can affect the barrier function of the skin. SHARPIN-deficient &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; mice develop a chronic dermatitis with similarities to atopic dermatitis in humans. Here, we used a recently-developed approach named multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling and single ion monitoring to rapidly identify discriminative lipid ions. Shorter fatty acyl residues and increased relative amounts of sphingosine ceramides were observed in &lt;i&gt;cpdm&lt;/i&gt; epidermis compared to wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by downregulation of the &lt;i&gt;Fasn&lt;/i&gt; gene which encodes fatty acid synthase. A profile of diverse lipids was generated by fast screening of over 300 transitions (ion pairs). Tentative attribution of the most significant transitions was confirmed by product ion scan (MS/MS), and the MRM-profiling linear intensity response was validated with a C17-ceramide lipid standard. Relative quantification of sphingosine ceramides CerAS(d18:1/24:0)2OH, CerAS(d18:1/16:0)2OH and CerNS(d18:1/16:0) discriminated between the two groups with 100% accuracy, while the free fatty acids cerotic acid, 16-hydroxy palmitic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had 96.4% of accuracy.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d26:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Moreover, for most datasets the motifs that Crunch identified de novo outperform known motifs and both the set of co-binding motifs and the top motif of solitary TFs are consistent across experiments and cell lines.

The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; and enables a direct comparison between polluted and “clean” adjacent areas.
Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85440:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Akram El Kateb, Claudio Stalder, Andres Rüggeberg, Christoph Neururer, Jorge E.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene. There was limited overlap between our results and previous Caatinga classifications.</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d73d:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Augusto C.

The conversion efficiency is determined by the materials figure of merit &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show a maximum &lt;i&gt;ZT&lt;/i&gt; of ~2.8 ± 0.5 at 773 kelvin in n-type tin selenide (SnSe) crystals out of plane. The thermal conductivity in layered SnSe crystals is the lowest in the out-of-plane direction [two-dimensional (2D) phonon transport].

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) are indicated as first-line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors harbor activating mutations in the EGFR gene. Erlotinib is also used in second and third-line therapy for patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR but to date there are no validated biomarkers useful to identify which patients may benefit from this treatment. The expression level of four miRNAs: miR-133b, -146a, -7 and -21 which target EGFR was investigated by real-time PCR in tumor specimens from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib administered as the second or third line. We found that miR-133b expression level better discriminated responder from non-responder patients to erlotinib. Higher levels of miR-133b in NSCLCs were associated with longer progression-free survival time of patients. Functional analyses on miR-133b through transfection of a miR-133b mimic in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines indicated that increasing miR-133b expression level led to a decreased cell growth and altered morphology but did not affect sensitivity to erlotinib. The detection of miR-133b expression levels in tumors help in the identification of NSCLC patients with a better prognosis and who are likely to benefit from second and third-line therapy with erlotinib.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196350</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb0:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alessandra Bisagni, Maria Pagano, Sally Maramotti, Francesca Zanelli, Martina Bonacini, Elena Tagliavini, Luca Braglia, Massimiliano Paci, Andrea Mozzarelli, Stefania Croci&lt;/p&gt;

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196986</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3beda:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

Stock correlation networks use stock price data to explore the relationship between different stocks listed in the stock market. Currently this relationship is dominantly measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient. However, financial data suggest that nonlinear relationships may exist in the stock prices of different shares. To address this issue, this work uses mutual information to characterize the nonlinear relationship between stocks. Using 280 stocks traded at the Shanghai Stocks Exchange in China during the period of 2014-2016, we first compare the effectiveness of the correlation coefficient and mutual information for measuring stock relationships. Based on these two measures, we then develop two stock networks using the Minimum Spanning Tree method and study the topological properties of these networks, including degree, path length and the power-law distribution. The relationship network based on mutual information has a better distribution of the degree and larger value of the power-law distribution than those using the correlation coefficient. Numerical results show that mutual information is a more effective approach than the correlation coefficient to measure the stock relationship in a stock market that may undergo large fluctuations of stock prices.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195941</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccbc:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xue Guo, Hu Zhang, Tianhai Tian&lt;/p&gt;

The mammalian kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) enzymes are a family of related isoforms that are pyridoxal 5’-phosphate-dependent, responsible for the irreversible transamination of kynurenine to kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid is implicated in human diseases such as schizophrenia where it is found in elevated levels and consequently KAT-II, as the isoform predominantly responsible for kynurenic acid production in the brain, has been targeted for the development of specific inhibitors. One class of compounds that have also shown inhibitory activity towards the KAT enzymes are estrogens and their sulfate esters. Estradiol disulfate in particular is very strongly inhibitory and it appears that the 17-sulfate makes a significant contribution to its potency. The work here demonstrates that the effect of this moiety can be mirrored in existing KAT-II inhibitors, from the development of two novel inhibitors, JN-01 and JN-02. Both inhibitors were based on NS-1502 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 315 μM), but the deliberate placement of a sulfonamide group significantly improved the potency of JN-01 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 73.8 μM) and JN-02 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 112.8 μM) in comparison to the parent compound. This 3–4 fold increase in potency shows the potential of these moieties to be accommodated in the KAT-II active site and the effect they can have on improving inhibitors, and the environments in the KAT-II have been suitably modelled using docking calculations.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196404</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f8bce0df:6907fb5:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gayan S.

The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that exhibit a complex infectious life cycle in both arthropod and mammalian hosts. As obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae are highly adapted to living inside a variety of host cells, including vascular endothelial cells during mammalian infection. Although it is assumed that the rickettsiae produce numerous virulence factors that usurp or disrupt various host cell pathways, they have been challenging to genetically manipulate to identify the key bacterial factors that contribute to infection. Motivated to overcome this challenge, we sought to expand the repertoire of available rickettsial loss-of-function mutants, using an improved &lt;i&gt;mariner&lt;/i&gt;-based transposon mutagenesis scheme. Here, we present the isolation of over 100 transposon mutants in the spotted fever group species &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia parkeri&lt;/i&gt;. Transposon insertions disrupted genes whose products are implicated in a variety of pathways, including bacterial replication and metabolism, the type IV secretion system, factors with previously established roles in host cell interactions and pathogenesis, or are of unknown function. Given the need to identify critical virulence factors, forward genetic screens such as this will provide an excellent platform to more directly investigate rickettsial biology and pathogenesis.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197012</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af8:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

Such influences can include constraints on network flows and concentration changes or more insidiously result in the emergence of feedback loops. These effects are due entirely to mass constraints imposed by the network configuration and are important considerations before any dynamical analysis is made. Most established simulation software tools usually carry out some kind of structural analysis of a network before any attempt is made at dynamic simulation. In this paper we describe a portable software library, libStructural, that can carry out a variety of popular structural analyses that includes conservation analysis, flux dependency analysis and enumerating elementary modes. The library employs robust algorithms that allow it to be used on large networks with more than a two thousand nodes. The library accepts either a raw or fully labeled stoichiometry matrix or models written in SBML format. The software is written in standard C/C++ and comes with documentation and a test suite. The software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and can be compiled easily on any Linux operating system. A language binding for Python is also available through the pip package manager making it trivial to install on any standard Python distribution. As a second example, we also create a new libStructural plugin for PathwayDesigner that allows solutions to be viewed graphically. The source code is licensed under the open source BSD license and is available on GitHub (https://github.com/sys-bio/Libstructural).</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245068v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163274497bd:f07c9f:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The topology of a reaction network can have a significant influence on the network&apos;s dynamical properties.

In this paper we describe a portable software library, libStructural, that can carry out a variety of popular structural analyses that includes conservation analysis, flux dependency analysis and enumerating elementary modes. The library employs robust algorithms that allow it to be used on large networks with more than a two thousand nodes. The library accepts either a raw or fully labeled stoichiometry matrix or models written in SBML format. The software is written in standard C/C++ and comes with documentation and a test suite. The software is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and can be compiled easily on any Linux operating system. A language binding for Python is also available through the pip package manager making it trivial to install on any standard Python distribution. As a second example, we also create a new libStructural plugin for PathwayDesigner that allows solutions to be viewed graphically.

To improve the overall welfare levels of sows and to reduce stress levels at late 35-day lactation, we selected targeted behavioral indicators that might be associated with stress. Therefore, we monitored and evaluated the adaptive capability of two different breeds of sows to the farrowing environment. In this study, Damin sows (Large White × Min pig sows, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) and Large White sows (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were farrowed in individual pens. Saliva was collected and tested for cortisol density at –15 min, and then at +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min after an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test conducted at 20, 27 and 34 d post-partum. The postures, including ventral and lateral recumbency to other postures, defecating, urinating, sham-chewing and bar-biting behavior, were observed by video from 07:00 to 09:00 and from 13:00 to 15:00 on the 7th day of each week from the 3rd to the 5th week post-parturition. In addition, the concentrations of salivary interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and secretory immunoglobulin (SIgA) were assayed after the observed behaviors. The results showed no significant difference between Damin sows and Large White sows in terms of behaviors at the 3rd week. Additionally, there were no significant differences between Damin and Large White sows in terms of the behaviors of ventral recumbency and bar-biting with the exception of lateral recumbency to other postures, sham-chewing, defecation and urination in the fifth week. Meanwhlie, there was significant difference between two breeds in term of ventral recumbency at the 4th week. The result of the ACTH test showed a significant difference between the Damin and Large White sows by the 27th and 34th days postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In addition, the serological concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were not significantly different between the two breeds at the 3rd week postpartum. However, these indicators were significantly different at the 5th week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.000, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003, respectively). The SIgA concentrations in saliva were significantly different between breeds at the 3rd week postpartum (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). In conclusion, both breeds of sows maybe in a state of stress after the 4th week postpartum. However, the Damin sows may be better than the Large White sows in terms of adapting to this farrowing environment.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197152</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd6:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Honggui Liu, Ran Yi, Chao Wang, Peng Zhao, Mingyue Zhang, Shiwen Xu, Jun Bao&lt;/p&gt;

For example, evidence-based clinical decisions regarding lung diseases require the segmentation of nodules, tumors, or cancers. However, the tendencies of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) to be large-sized, irregularly shaped, and to grow against the surrounding structures can cause even expert clinicians to experience difficulty with accurate segmentation. Methods: An automated delineation tool based on spatial analysis was developed and studied on 25 sets of CT scans of primary NSCLCs with diverse radiological characteristics (sizes, shapes, contouring, localization, and microenvironment). Manual and automated gross delineations of the gross tumor were compared using a specific metric built based on spatially overlapping pixels. Results: The proposed algorithm exhibited robustness in terms of the tumor size (5.32 - 18.24 mm), shape (spherical or non-spherical), contouring (lobulated, spiculated, or cavitated), localization (solitary, pleural, mediastinal, endobronchial, or tagging), and microenvironment (left or right lobe), with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 80-98%, 85-99%, and 84-99%, respectively. Conclusions: Small discrepancies were observed between the manual and automated delineations. These might have risen from the variability in the practitioners&apos; definitions of ROIs or from imaging artifacts that reduced the tissue resolution.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/304949v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162eceed7c5:58838b2:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Quantitative reasoning in medical decision science relies on the delineation of pathological objects.

Temporal networks show how these networks evolve over time. Studying the temporal progression of network topologies is of utmost importance since it uncovers how a network evolves and how it resists to external stimuli and internal variations. Two temporal networks have co-evolving subnetworks if the topologies of these subnetworks remain similar to each other as the network topology evolves over a period of time. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying co-evolving pair of temporal networks, which aim to capture the evolution of molecules and their interactions over time. Although this problem shares some characteristics of the well-known network alignment problems, it differs from existing network alignment formulations as it seeks a mapping of the two network topologies that is invariant to temporal evolution of the given networks. This is a computationally challenging problem as it requires capturing not only similar topologies between two networks but also their similar evolution patterns. Results: We present an efficient algorithm, Tempo, for solving identifying coevolving subnetworks with two given temporal networks. We formally prove the correctness of our method. We experimentally demonstrate that Tempo scales efficiently with the size of network as well as the number of time points, and generates statistically significant alignments-even when evolution rates of given networks are high. Our results on a human aging dataset demonstrate that Tempo identifies novel genes contributing to the progression of Alzheimer&apos;s, Huntington&apos;s and Type II diabetes, while existing methods fail to do so.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/303974v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_162db0a6fb8:3ef3dd2:9f3b30f2</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Motivation: Biological networks describes the mechanisms which govern cellular functions.

&lt;i&gt;Deltoblastus batheri&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Deltoblastus delta&lt;/i&gt; occur concurrently in many Permian deposits from Timor. Closely related sister species living in direct proximity without alteration in feeding habit would be in direct violation of Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These two species were measured and compared to see if any evidence of differentiation along feeding lines has occurred in order to reduce direct competition. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values obtained via Student’s t test display significant differentiation across all measured parameters.

Closely related sister species living in direct proximity without alteration in feeding habit would be in direct violation of Lotka-Volterra dynamics. These two species were measured and compared to see if any evidence of differentiation along feeding lines has occurred in order to reduce direct competition. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values obtained via Student’s t test display significant differentiation across all measured parameters. Thin-plate splines were used to visualize these differences, and clearly show the differences which are focused on the ambulacral region of the blastoids, which are the primary food gathering point for these species.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5064.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5064</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5064.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Da Meng, Hui-quan Li, Karl Deisseroth, Stefan Leutgeb, Nicholas C.

Objective &lt;p&gt;We derive a novel model-based metric for effective adherence to medication, and validate it using data from the INhaler Compliance Assessment device (INCA&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;). This technique employs dose timing data to estimate the threshold drug concentration needed to maintain optimal health.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The parameters of the model are optimised against patient outcome data using maximum likelihood methods. The model is fitted and validated by secondary analysis of two independent datasets from two remote-monitoring studies of adherence, conducted through clinical research centres of 5 Irish hospitals. Training data came from a cohort of asthma patients (~ 47,000 samples from 218 patients). Validation data is from a cohort of 204 patients with COPD recorded between 2014 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The time above threshold measure is strongly predictive of adverse events (exacerbations) in COPD patients (Odds Ratio of exacerbation = 0.52 per SD increase in adherence, 95% Confidence Interval [0.34–0.79]). This compares well with the best known previous method, the Area Under the dose-time Curve (AUC) (Odds Ratio = 0.69, 95% Confidence Interval [0.48–0.99]). In addition, the fitted value of the dose threshold (0.56 of prescribed dosage) suggests that prescribed doses may be unnecessarily high given good adherence.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The resulting metric accounts for missed doses, dose-timing errors, and errors in inhaler technique, and provides enhanced predictive validity in comparison to previously used measures. In addition, the method allows us to estimate the correct dosage required to achieve the effect of the medication using the patients’ own adherence data and outcomes. The adherence score does depend not on sex or other demographic factors suggesting that effective adherence is driven by individual behavioural factors.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195663</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f8:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Garrett Greene, Richard W.

The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B–light chain 3 (LC3)–decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that stimulate the production of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a form of noncanonical autophagy, is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the stimulation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides, the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not stimulated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation, which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition, we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN production in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN production.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/528/eaan4144?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>RuJRIXzN26JgDGk9YhlIBfh4YrPi0r+1c4exm9G1IBw=_1631d59998b:2772b1e:4e164c41</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://stke.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Signaling current issue</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomes and activates distinct signaling pathways to stimulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs).

We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN production in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN production.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</link><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Minglang Wang</name></author><published>1526268744000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><crawled>1526387566858</crawled><fingerprint>8147d7bb</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025190?af=R</originId><title>Effect of molecular conformations on the electronic transport in oxygen-substituted alkanethiol molecular junctions</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 18, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16363c9e90a:38e659d:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/18&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 18&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04249-x</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/rVYFP0dNHa4/s41467-018-04249-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Sander J.

Here using rabies tracing, electrophysiology and genetic tools, we compare the whole-brain inputs to these two types of striatal interneurons and dissect their functional connectivity in mice. ChAT interneurons receive a substantial cortical input from associative regions of cortex, such as the orbitofrontal cortex. Amongst subcortical inputs, a previously unknown inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus input to striatal PV interneurons is identified.

Here using rabies tracing, electrophysiology and genetic tools, we compare the whole-brain inputs to these two types of striatal interneurons and dissect their functional connectivity in mice. ChAT interneurons receive a substantial cortical input from associative regions of cortex, such as the orbitofrontal cortex. Amongst subcortical inputs, a previously unknown inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus input to striatal PV interneurons is identified. Additionally, the external segment of the globus pallidus targets striatal ChAT interneurons, which is sufficient to inhibit tonic ChAT interneuron firing. Finally, we describe a novel excitatory pathway from the pedunculopontine nucleus that innervates ChAT interneurons. These results establish the brain-wide direct inputs of two major types of striatal interneurons and allude to distinct roles in regulating striatal activity and controlling behavior.</description><engagement>7</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00267</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/VyDSXZ34f80/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00267</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Ikjot Sodhi, Abhay T.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>118</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16340d7cea2:14b5655:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/E4340</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/19/E4340/F1.medium.gif</url><height>290</height><contentType>image/gif</contentType><width>440</width></visual><author><name>Simon J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study is to generate an ultrasonic nanobubble (NB)-mediated purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP)/fludarabine suicide gene system for the treatment of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;NBs were prepared from a mixture the phospholipids 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DPPA), perfluoropropane gas and other materials using the high shear dispersion method. NBs treated with ultrasound irradiation functioned as a gene-transfer system, and a self-constructed suicide gene expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP, treated with fludarabine functioned as a therapeutic gene. This system was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of PNP/fludarabine on HepG2 cells and SMMC7721 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1. NBs with a small diameter (208–416 nm) and at a high concentration and fine homogeneity were prepared under the optimal method. 2. The pcDNA3.1(+)/PNP plasmid was efficiently transfected into HCC cells using ultrasonic NBs. 3. At 0.75μg/ml fludarabine, PNP/fludarabine showed marked cytotoxic effects toward HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells. PNP/fludarabine achieved the same effect against both SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells but at a lower concentration of fludarabine for the latter. 4. Bystander effects: a 10–20% decrease in the cell survival rate was observed when only 5–10% of transfected cells were PNP positive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;NBs constitute a non-toxic, stable and effective gene-delivery platform. The PNP/fludarabine suicide gene system inhibited the growth of HCC cells, induced HCC cell apoptosis, and caused a notable bystander effect at a low fludarabine concentration. This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196686</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a185:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Zhang, Mingna Chen, Youming Zhang, Wei Chen, Lihua Zhang, Lv Chen&lt;/p&gt;

This study establishes an important new method for miniaturizing microbubbles and improving a new NB-mediated approach for gene therapy of HCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.1002629</link><recrawled>1524678303719</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/5VBEta8C2-A/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>The PLOS Biology Staff</name></author><published>1524690000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: Brain–Computer Interface–Based Communication in the Completely Locked-In State</title><updated>1524690000000</updated><crawled>1524678233223</crawled><fingerprint>e161df4d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.1002629</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5VBEta8C2-A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162fde78c87:39d454:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS Biology Staff &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5VBEta8C2-A&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002629</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02355</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/zItUi8L-jX4/acs.jpcb.8b02355</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Max A.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses.

This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Bárbara Alemar</name></author><published>1526072400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: &amp;lt;i&gt;BRCA1&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;BRCA2&amp;lt;/i&gt; mutational profile and prevalence in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) probands from Southern Brazil: Are international testing criteria appropriate for this specific population?</title><updated>1526072400000</updated><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><fingerprint>58e9ae64</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197529</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bárbara Alemar, Cleandra Gregório, Josef Herzog, Camila Matzenbacher Bittar, Cristina Brinckmann Oliveira Netto, Osvaldo Artigalas, Ida Vanessa D.

The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YvqYr2rgaRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>201</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16317b82452:13eb349:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Camilo Barbosa, Robert Beardmore, Hinrich Schulenburg, Gunther Jansen&lt;/p&gt;

To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage. Objective: Our primary goal was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting sepsis using streaming physiological data in real-time. Methods: A dataset consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1,161 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was analyzed in this IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study. Of that total, 634 patients were identified to have developed sepsis. In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset. Conclusions: The use of robust machine learning algorithms, continuous streams of physiological data, and WBC, allows for early identification of at-risk patients in real-time with high accuracy.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/322305v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16364f99611:3b33262:2835af05</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Rationale: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs.

Osteoblast differentiation is a highly regulated process that requires coordinated information from both soluble factors and the extracellular matrix. Among these extracellular stimuli, chemical and physical properties of the matrix are sensed through cell surface receptors such as integrins and transmitted into the nucleus to drive specific gene expression. Here, we showed that the conditional deletion of β1 integrins in the osteo-precursor population severely impacts bone formation and homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Mutant mice displayed a severe bone deficit characterized by bone fragility and reduced bone mass. We showed that β1 integrins are required for proper BMP2 dependent signaling at the pre-osteoblastic stage, by positively modulating Smad1/5-dependent transcriptional activity at the nuclear level. The lack of β1 integrins results in a transcription modulation that relies on a cooperative defect with other transcription factors rather than a plain blunted BMP2 response. Our results point to a nuclear modulation of Smad1/5 transcriptional activity by β1 integrins, allowing a tight control of osteoblast differentiation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196021</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7fe:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Molly Brunner, Noémie Mandier, Thierry Gautier, Genevieve Chevalier, Anne-Sophie Ribba, Philippe Guardiola, Marc R.

The aim of the present study is to differentiate subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) using ex vivo ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Included were 14 surgically resected hippocampi of patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. The resected hippocampi were histologically categorized into subtypes of hippocampal sclerosis (HS type 1 (n = 10), HS type 2 (n = 2) and no-HS (n = 2)) and subsequently scanned on a preclinical 7T MRI acquiring T2-weighted morphology, relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging. On the morphological images, the pyramidal cell layer (PCL) of the hippocampus was segmented and the following parameters were derived: T2 signal intensity, T1-, T2- and T2*-relaxation times, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Furthermore, the area of the PCL was determined, as well as the parameter product which refers to the widths of the PCL parallel and perpendicular to the stratum moleculare. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to demonstrate relationships between MR-parameters and type of sclerosis. In comparison to no-HS specimens, the PCL was significantly narrower in HS type 1 and HS type 2 hippocampi. This narrowing affected the entire cornu ammonis sector (CA) 1 in HS type 1, while it was limited to the upper half of CA1 in direction to CA2 in HS type 2. The parameter product median increased from 0.43 to 1.67 and 2.91 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS, respectively. Correlation coefficients were significant for the PCL parameters product (0.73), area (0.71), T2*-time (-0.67), FA (0.65) and ADC (0.55). Our initial results suggest that HS type 1, HS type 2 and no-HS subtypes can be distinguished from each other using ex vivo UHF MRI based on T2-weighted morphologic images and the assessment of the parameter product. Upon clinical translation, UHF-MRI may provide a promising technique for the preoperative differentiation of HS subtypes in patients.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196008</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9e7277b:3c4fe35:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Clarissa Gillmann, Roland Coras, Karl Rössler, Arnd Doerfler, Michael Uder, Ingmar Blümcke, Tobias Bäuerle&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a new tool developed to overcome some limitations of pairwise meta-analyses. NMAs provide evidence on more than two comparators simultaneously. This study aimed to map the characteristics of the published NMAs on drug therapy comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review of NMAs comparing pharmacological interventions was performed. Searches in Medline (PubMed) and Scopus along with manual searches were conducted. The main characteristics of NMAs were systematically collected: publication metadata, criteria for drug inclusion, statistical methods used, and elements reported. A methodological quality score with 25 key elements was created and applied to the included NMAs. To identify potential trends, the median of the publication year distribution was used as a cut-off.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study identified 365 NMAs published from 2003 to 2016 in more than 30 countries. Randomised controlled trials were the primary source of data, with only 5% including observational studies, and 230 NMAs used a placebo as a comparator. Less than 15% of NMAs were registered in PROSPERO or a similar system. One third of studies followed PRISMA and less than 9% Cochrane recommendations. Around 30% presented full-search strategies of the systematic review, and 146 NMAs stated the selection criteria for drug inclusion. Over 75% of NMAs presented network plots, but only half described their geometry. Statistical parameters (model fit, inconsistency, convergence) were properly reported by one third of NMAs. Although 216 studies exhibited supplemental material, no data set of primary studies was available. The methodological quality score (mean 13·9; SD 3·8) presented a slightly positive trend over the years.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The map of the published NMAs emphasises the potential of this tool to gather evidence in healthcare, but it also identified some weaknesses, especially in the report, which limits its transparency and reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196644</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16317b8efb4:2007e59:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fernanda S.

Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years.

Soil salinity is a common and serious environmental problem worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered as bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. However, few studies have addressed the possible benefits of AMF inoculation for medicinal plants under saline conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of colonization with two AMF, &lt;i&gt;Funneliformis mosseae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diversispora versiformis&lt;/i&gt;, alone and in combination, on the growth and nutrient uptake of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt; (Hangbaiju) in a greenhouse salt stress experiment. After 6 weeks of a non-saline pretreatment, Hangbaiju plants with and without AMF were grown for five months under salinity levels that were achieved using 0, 50 and 200 mM NaCl. Root length, shoot and root dry weight, total dry weight, and root N concentration were higher in the mycorrhizal plants than in the non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of moderate salinity, especially with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; colonization. As salinity increased, mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal dependence decreased. The enhancement of root N uptake is probably the main mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. These results suggest that the symbiotic associations between the fungus &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;morifolium&lt;/i&gt; plants may be useful in biotechnological practice.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196408</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6f:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yanhong Wang, Minqiang Wang, Yan Li, Aiping Wu, Juying Huang&lt;/p&gt;

The Old World farming system arose in the semi-arid Mediterranean environments of southwest Asia. Pioneer farmers settling the interior of the Balkans by the early sixth millennium BC were among the first to introduce southwest Asian-style cultivation and herding into areas with increasingly continental temperate conditions. Previous research has shown that the bioarchaeological assemblages from early farming sites in southeast Europe vary in their proportions of plant and animal taxa, but the relationship between taxonomic variation and climate has remained poorly understood. To uncover associations between multiple species and environmental factors simultaneously, we explored a dataset including altitude, five bioclimatic and 30 bioarchaeological variables (plant and animal taxa) for 57 of the earliest farming sites in southeast Europe using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). An extension of correspondence analysis, CCA is widely used in applied ecology to answer similar questions of species-environment relationships, but has not been previously applied in prehistoric archaeology to explore taxonomic and climatic variables in conjunction. The analyses reveal that the changes in plant and animal exploitation which occurred with the northward dispersal of farmers, crops and livestock correlate with south-north climate gradients, and emphasize the importance of adaptations in the animal domain for the initial establishment of farming beyond the Mediterranean areas.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197225</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721d:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Ivanova, Bea De Cupere, Jonathan Ethier, Elena Marinova&lt;/p&gt;

The spatial distribution of nine Northwest Atlantic groundfish stocks was documented using spatial indicators based on Northeast Fisheries Science Center spring and fall bottom trawl survey data, 1963–2016. We then evaluated the relative importance of population size, fishing pressure and bottom temperature on spatial distribution with an information theoretic approach. Northward movement in the spring was generally consistent with prior analyses, whereas changes in depth distribution and area occupancy were not. Only two stocks exhibited the same changes in spatiotemporal distribution in the fall as compared with the spring. Fishing pressure was the most important predictor of the center of gravity (i.e., bivariate mean location of the population) for the majority of stocks in the spring, whereas in the fall this was restricted to the east-west component. Fishing pressure was also the most important predictor of the dispersion around the center of gravity in both spring and fall. In contrast, biomass was the most important predictor of area occupancy for the majority of stocks in both seasons. The relative importance of bottom temperature was ranked highest in the fewest number of cases. This study shows that fishing pressure, in addition to the previously established role of climate, influences the spatial distribution of groundfish in the Northwest Atlantic. More broadly, this study is one of a small but growing body of literature to demonstrate that fishing pressure has an effect on the spatial distribution of marine resources. Future work must consider both fishing pressure and climate when examining mechanisms underlying fish distribution shifts.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196583</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae7f:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charles F.

The effects of age on neophobia and exploration are best described in birds and primates, and broader comparisons require reports from other taxa. Here we present data showing age-dependent exploration in a long-lived social species, the common vampire bat (&lt;i&gt;Desmodus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;). A previous study found that vampire bats regurgitated food to partners trapped in a cage. Interestingly, while only a few adult bats visited the trapped bat, in every trial all or most of the eight young males in the colony would visit the trapped bat without feeding it. To test whether this behavioral difference resulted from age class differences in exploration, we compared responses of the bats to a trapped conspecific versus an inanimate novel object. Some adults and young showed interest in trapped conspecifics, but only the young males explored the novel objects. Additional novel object tests in a second captive colony showed that higher rates of novel object exploration were shown by young of both sexes. Our results corroborate past findings from other mammals and birds that age predicts exploration. If age-dependent exploration is indeed adaptive, then the role of age as a predictor of exploration tendency should depend on species-specific life history traits. Finally, because younger vampire bats also appear to have higher exposure to pathogens such as rabies virus, there may be implications for pathogen transmission if younger and more exploratory vampire bats are more likely to feed on novel hosts.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196889</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae8:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gerald G.

Coral reefs protect islands from tropical storm waves and provide goods and services for millions of islanders worldwide. Yet it is unknown how coral reefs in general, and carbonate production in particular, will respond to sea-level rise and thermal stress associated with climate change. This study compared the reef-building capacity of different shallow-water habitats at twenty-four sites on each of two islands, Palau and Yap, in the western Pacific Ocean. We were particularly interested in estimating the inverse problem of calculating the value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative, and whether that value varied across habitats. Net carbonate production varied among habitats, averaging 10.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for outer reefs, 12.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for patch reefs, and 7.2 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for inner reefs. The value of live coral cover at which net carbonate production became negative varied across habitats, with highest values on inner reefs. These results suggest that some inner reefs tend to produce less carbonate, and therefore need higher coral cover to produce enough carbonate to keep up with sea-level rise than outer and patch reefs. These results also suggest that inner reefs are more vulnerable to sea-level rise than other habitats, which stresses the need for effective land-use practices as the climate continues to change. Averaging across all reef habitats, the rate of carbonate production was 9.7 kg CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 7.9 mm y&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of potential vertical accretion.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197432</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fda:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rivka R.

The response of each gene to changes in TF activity is generally assumed to be encoded in the promoter. Here we show that, even when the promoter itself remains constant, each gene has a unique TF dose response curve. Many genes have an intrinsic ability to either buffer or amplify the effects of high promoter activity. We present a coupled mathematical model and experimental system for quantifying this property. Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3UTR and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression. The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/215186v3?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1632cf802e5:17eea70:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Cells regulate gene expression by changing the concentration and activity of transcription factors (TFs).

It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an &amp;quot;aesthetics associated traits cluster&amp;quot; and a Factor &amp;quot;personality traits cluster&amp;quot; which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7219:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Klaus Sinko, Ulrich S.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05126-9/d41586-018-05126-9_15744626.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><published>1525762800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt</title><crawled>1525801790399</crawled><fingerprint>97c95447</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05126-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short stinging organs tend to carry more-toxic venom — but inflict less pain — than long ones.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16340dfabbf:493f3a:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to tell how much wasp stings will hurt, Published online: 08 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05126-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05126-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Short stinging organs tend to carry more-toxic venom — but inflict less pain — than long ones.</content></content><engagement>93</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197163</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197163</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Hiroki Maita</name></author><published>1525986000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza in a rural primary care setting in Japan: A cross sectional observational study</title><updated>1525986000000</updated><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><fingerprint>93393f2a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197163</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroki Maita, Tadashi Kobayashi, Hiroshi Osawa, Hiroyuki Kato&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the accuracy and optimal cut-off point of self-diagnosis and clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza compared with rapid influenza diagnostic tests as the reference standard, we conducted a cross sectional observational study at a rural clinic in Japan.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data during three influenza seasons (December 2013 to April 2016) were retrospectively collected from the medical records and pre-examination sheets of 111 patients aged &gt;11 years (mean age 48.1 years, men 53.2%) who were suspected of influenza infection and underwent rapid influenza diagnostic testing. Patients’ characteristics (age, sex, and past medical history of influenza infection), clinical signs (axillary temperature, pulse rate, cough, joint and muscle pain, and history of fever [acute or sudden, gradual, and absence of fever]), duration from the onset of symptoms, severity of feeling sick compared with a common cold (severe, similar, and mild), self-reported likelihood of influenza (%), and results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the optimal cut-off point (30%) for estimation of self-diagnosis of seasonal influenza, the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) was 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.00) and negative likelihood ratio (LR–) was 0.57 (0.35 to 0.93). At a 10% cut-off point, LR–was 0.33 (0.12 to 0.96). At an 80% cut-off point, LR+ was 2.75 (0.75 to 10.07). As for clinical signs, the combination of acute or sudden onset fever and cough had LR+ of 3.27 (1.68 to 6.35). Absence of cough showed LR–of 0.15 (0.04 to 0.61).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosis of influenza using the optimal cut-off point (30%) was not found useful for ruling in or ruling out an influenza diagnosis. However, it could be useful when patients self-report extremely high (80%) or low (10%) probability of having influenza.

Mechanical ventilation is an important tool for supporting critically ill patients but may also exert pathological forces on lung cells leading to Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). We hypothesised that inhibition of the force-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV4) ion channel may attenuate the negative effects of mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch increased intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung epithelial cells that was partially blocked by about 30% with the selective TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874, but nearly completely blocked with the pan-calcium channel blocker ruthenium red, suggesting the involvement of more than one calcium channel in the response to mechanical stress. Mechanical stretch also induced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from M1 macrophages, but in contrast this was entirely dependent upon TRPV4. In a murine ventilation model, TRPV4 inhibition attenuated both pulmonary barrier permeability increase and pro-inflammatory cytokines release due to high tidal volume ventilation. Taken together, these data suggest TRPV4 inhibitors may have utility as a prophylactic pharmacological treatment to improve the negative pathological stretch-response of lung cells during ventilation and potentially support patients receiving mechanical ventilation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196055</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d4b0457a:3344164:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by N.

Background &lt;p&gt;Prediction of disease burden in China arising from smoking based on earlier cohorts in the West and China could not reflect the disease burden at the current stage accurately. No cohort studies in China focused specifically on people born since 1950. We examined the risk of all-cause mortality attributed to smoking in adults in Guangzhou, the city with the most rapidly expanding economy in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;This population-based prospective cohort included 21,658 women and 8,284 men aged 50+ years enrolled from 2003–2008 and followed until January 2016. During an average follow-up of 8.8 (standard deviation = 1.8) years, 2,986 (1,586 women, 1,400 men) deaths were recorded. After adjustment for confounders, the hazards ratios (95% confidence interval (CI)) of all-cause mortality in current versus never smokers increased from 1.61 (95% CI 1.45–1.80) in those born in 1920–1939 to 2.02 (95% CI 1.74–2.34), and 4.40 (95% CI 3.14–6.17), in those born in the 1940s and 1950s, respectively (P for trend 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In smokers born after 1949 in Guangzhou and other areas which have the longest history of smoking, the mortality risk could have reached three fold that of non-smokers, as in the UK, US and Australia. If confirmed, unless China quickly and strictly complies with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control with massive smoking cessation in the population, this is a more striking warning that China will be facing an even larger disease burden from tobacco use than previous forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196610</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbb:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tai Hing Lam, Lin Xu, Chao Qiang Jiang, Wei Sen Zhang, Feng Zhu, Ya Li Jin, G.

= 0.26 kcal/mol) associated with electron transfer in Be2B36Li21 and Be2B36 species confirm that boron rich species have potential abilities to be used in the Li‐based battery. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1633527c69f:221b4ea:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315408v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/06/315408</canonicalUrl><author><name>Basharat, Z.</name></author><published>1525590000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Drug target identification and virtual screening in pursuit of phytochemical intervention of Mycobacterium chelonae [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1525641119573</crawled><fingerprint>42395f56</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315408v1?rss=1</originId><description>Mycobacterium chelonae is a rapidly growing mycobacterium present in the environment.

However, dimensionality of imaging data, together with a great variability of nuclear shapes present challenges for 3D morphological analysis. Thus, there is a compelling need for robust 3D nuclear morphometric techniques to carry out population-wise analysis. We propose a new approach that combines modeling, analysis, and interpretation of morphometric characteristics of cell nuclei and nucleoli in 3D. We use robust surface reconstruction that allows accurate approximation of 3D object boundary. Then, we compute geometric morphological measures characterizing the form of cell nuclei and nucleoli. Using these features, we compare over 450 nuclei with about 1,000 nucleoli of epithelial and mesenchymal prostate cancer cells, as well as 1,000 nuclei with over 2,000 nucleoli from serum-starved and proliferating fibroblast cells. Classification of sets of 9 and 15 cells achieves accuracy of 95.4% and 98%, respectively, for prostate cancer cells, and 95% and 98% for fibroblast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313411v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1632539c255:b6d709:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Quantitative analysis of morphological changes in a cell nucleus is important for understanding of nuclear architecture and their relationship with pathological conditions such as cancer.

To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine these methods for 3D nuclear shape modeling and morphometry into a highly parallel pipeline workflow for morphometric analysis of thousands of nuclei and nucleoli in 3D.</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00270</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/f6QyDQtN2_s/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00270</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Mingfei Zhang, Linwei Lu, Man Ying, Huitong Ruan, Xiaoyi Wang, Huan Wang, Zhilan Chai, Songli Wang, Changyou Zhan, Jun Pan, Weiyue Lu</name></author><published>1526529600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00270/20180517/images/medium/mp-2018-00270j_0012.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00270&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Isolated mitochondria are widely used to study the function of the organelle. Typically, mitochondria are prepared using differential centrifugation alone or in conjunction with density gradient ultracentrifugation. However, mitochondria isolated using differential centrifugation contain membrane or organelle contaminants, and further purification of crude mitochondria by density gradient ultracentrifugation requires large amounts of starting material, and is time-consuming. Mitochondria have also been isolated by irreversible binding to antibody-coated magnetic beads. We developed a method to prepare mitochondria from budding yeast that overcomes many of the limitations of other methods. Mitochondria are tagged by insertion of 6 histidines (6xHis) into the &lt;i&gt;TOM70&lt;/i&gt; (Translocase of outer membrane 70) gene at its chromosomal locus, isolated using Ni-NTA (nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid) paramagnetic beads and released from the magnetic beads by washing with imidazole. Mitochondria prepared using this method contain fewer contaminants, and are similar in ultrastructure as well as protein import and cytochrome c oxidase complex activity compared to mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation. Moreover, this isolation method is amenable to small samples, faster than purification by differential and density gradient centrifugation, and more cost-effective than purification using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Importantly, this method can be applied to any cell type where the genetic modification can be introduced by CRISPR or other methods.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196632</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefbe:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Pin-Chao Liao, Istvan R.

Admixture studies rely on local ancestry inference for admixed individuals, which consists of computing at each locus the number of copies that originate from ancestral source populations.

Here, we introduce Loter, an open-source software package that does not require any biological parameter besides haplotype data in order to make local ancestry inference available for a wide range of species. Using simulations, we compare the performance of Loter to HAPMIX, LAMP-LD, and RFMix. HAPMIX is the only software severely impacted by imperfect haplotype reconstruction. Loter is the less impacted software by increasing admixture time when considering simulated and admixed human genotypes. For simulations of admixed Populus genotypes, Loter and LAMP-LD are robust to increasing admixture times by contrast to RFMix. When comparing length of reconstructed and true ancestry tracts, Loter and LAMP-LD provide results whose accuracy is again more robust than RFMix to increasing admixture times. We apply Loter to individuals resulting from admixture between Populus trichocarpa and Populus balsamifera and lengths of ancestry tracts indicate that admixture took place around 100 generations ago. We expect that providing a rapid and parameter-free software for local ancestry inference will make more accessible genomic studies about admixture processes.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/213728v2?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163038283a8:4a03fc:11c251fd</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Admixture between populations provides opportunity to study biological adaptation and phenotypic variation.

Past and recent attempts at devising objective biomarkers for traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid have focused on abundance measures of time-dependent proteins. Similar independent determinants would be most welcome in diagnosing the most common form of TBI, mild TBI (mTBI), which remains difficult to define and confirm based solely on clinical criteria. There are currently no consensus diagnostic measures that objectively define individuals as having sustained an acute mTBI. Plasma metabolomic analyses have recently evolved to offer an alternative to proteomic analyses, offering an orthogonal diagnostic measure to what is currently available. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a developed set of metabolomic biomarkers is able to objectively classify college athletes sustaining mTBI from non-injured teammates, within 6 hours of trauma and whether such a biomarker panel could be effectively applied to an independent cohort of TBI and control subjects.
A 6-metabolite panel was developed from biomarkers that had their identities confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in our Athlete cohort. These biomarkers were defined at ≤6 hours following mTBI and objectively classified mTBI athletes from teammate controls, and provided similar classification of these groups at the 2, 3, and 7 days post-mTBI. The same 6-metabolite panel, when applied to a separate, independent cohort provided statistically similar results despite major differences between the two cohorts. Our confirmed plasma biomarker panel objectively classifies acute mTBI cases from controls within 6 hours of injury in our two independent cohorts. While encouraged by our initial results, we expect future studies to expand on these initial observations.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195318</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e7f3:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Massimo S.

The thalamus, a crucial regulator of cortical functions, is composed of many nuclei arranged in a spatially complex pattern. Thalamic neurogenesis occurs over a short period during mammalian embryonic development. These features have hampered the effort to understand how regionalization, cell divisions, and fate specification are coordinated and produce a wide array of nuclei that exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression and functions. Here, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; clonal analysis to track the divisions of individual progenitor cells and spatial allocation of their progeny in the developing mouse thalamus. Quantitative analysis of clone compositions revealed evidence for sequential generation of distinct sets of thalamic nuclei based on the location of the founder progenitor cells. Furthermore, we identified intermediate progenitor cells that produced neurons populating more than one thalamic nuclei, indicating a prolonged specification of nuclear fate. Our study reveals an organizational principle that governs the spatial and temporal progression of cell divisions and fate specification and provides a framework for studying cellular heterogeneity and connectivity in the mammalian thalamus.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bh5Rbs1VtLg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>1</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b4:76251cdd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel Z.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/2cAwf6pBIME/s41598-018-25177-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Joana Costa-Gouveia</name></author><published>1525935600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles</title><crawled>1525940317057</crawled><fingerprint>6a3df55d</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16349216b81:11b4d48:93d646dc</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles, Published online: 10 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25177-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Publisher Correction: Combination therapy for tuberculosis treatment: pulmonary administration of ethionamide and booster co-loaded nanoparticles&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/2cAwf6pBIME&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25177-2</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Jos Oudeman</name></author><published>1525899600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Diffusion tensor MRI of the healthy brachial plexus</title><updated>1525899600000</updated><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><fingerprint>6c1078ed</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196975</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jos Oudeman, Camiel Verhamme, Maurits P.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Diffusion Tensor MRI (DT-MRI) is a promising tool for the evaluation of brachial plexus pathology.

Means of fractional-anisotropy (FA), mean-diffusivity (MD), axial-diffusivity (AD), and radial-diffusivity (RD) for the individual roots and trunks were evaluated. A stepwise forward approach was applied to test for correlations with age, sex, body-mass-index (BMI), bodysurface, height, and bodyweight. Within-subject, intra-rater, and inter-rater repeatability were assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass-correlation (ICC), and minimal detectable difference (MDD).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;No differences between sides and root levels were found. MD, AD, and RD correlated (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) with bodyweight. Within-subject quantification proved repeatable with CVs for FA, MD, AD, and RD of 16%, 12%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;The DT-MRI protocol was fast and repeatable.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community.

Coal mining has led to increasingly serious land subsidence, and the reclamation of the subsided land has become a hot topic of concern for governments and scholars. Soil quality of reclaimed land is the key indicator to the evaluation of the reclamation effect; hence, rapid monitoring and evaluation of reclaimed land is of great significance. Visible-near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has been shown to be a rapid, timely and efficient tool for the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC). In this study, 104 soil samples were collected from the Baodian mining area of Shandong province. Vis-NIR reflectance spectra and soil organic carbon content were then measured under laboratory conditions. The spectral data were first denoised using the Savitzky-Golay (SG) convolution smoothing method or the multiple scattering correction (MSC) method, after which the spectral reflectance (R) was subjected to reciprocal, reciprocal logarithm and differential transformations to improve spectral sensitivity. Finally, regression models for estimating the SOC content by the spectral data were constructed using partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results showed that: (1) The SOC content in the mining area was generally low (at the below-average level) and exhibited great variability. (2) The spectral reflectance increased with the decrease of soil organic carbon content. In addition, the sensitivity of the spectrum to the change in SOC content, especially that in the near-infrared band of the original reflectance, decreased when the SOC content was low. (3) The modeling results performed best when the spectral reflectance was preprocessed by Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing coupled with multiple scattering correction (MSC) and first-order differential transformation (modeling R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.86, RMSE = 2.00 g/kg, verification R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.78, RMSE = 1.81 g/kg, and RPD = 2.69). In addition, the first-order differential of R combined with SG, MSC with R, SG together with MSC and R also produced better modeling results than other pretreatment combinations. Vis-NIR modeling with specific spectral preprocessing methods could predict SOC content effectively.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196198</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162e4239f6d:4c4e805:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wenjuan Sun, Xinju Li, Beibei Niu&lt;/p&gt;

Each neuromast shows hair bundles arranged in two opposing directions and each afferent neuron only innervate HCs of the same orientation. In previous paper, we show that this opposition is established by expression of Emx2 in half of the HCs, where it mediates hair bundle reversal (Jiang et al. 2017).

Each neuromast shows hair bundles arranged in two opposing directions and each afferent neuron only innervate HCs of the same orientation. In previous paper, we show that this opposition is established by expression of Emx2 in half of the HCs, where it mediates hair bundle reversal (Jiang et al. 2017). Here, we show that Emx2 also regulates neuronal selection: afferent neurons innervate either Emx2-positive or negative HCs. In emx2 knockout and gain-of-function neuromasts, all HCs are unidirectional and the innervation patterns and physiological responses of the afferent neurons are dependent on the presence or absence of Emx2. Our results indicate that Emx2 mediates the directional selectivity of neuromasts by two distinct processes: regulating hair bundle orientation in HCs and selecting afferent neuronal targets.</description><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196542</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196542</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Gabriela Luiza Nogueira Vitral</name></author><published>1524776400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Skin thickness as a potential marker of gestational age at birth despite different fetal growth profiles: A feasibility study</title><updated>1524776400000</updated><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><fingerprint>5003b2fd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196542</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriela Luiza Nogueira Vitral, Regina Amélia P.

Background &lt;p&gt;New methodologies to estimate gestational age (GA) at birth are demanded to face the limited access to obstetric ultrasonography and imprecision of postnatal scores. The study analyzed the correlation between neonatal skin thickness and pregnancy duration. Secondarily, it investigated the influence of fetal growth profiles on tissue layer dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;In a feasibility study, 222 infants selected at a term-to-preterm ratio of 1:1 were assessed. Reliable information on GA was based on the early ultrasonography-based reference. The thicknesses of the epidermal and dermal skin layers were examined using high-frequency ultrasonography. We scanned the skin over the forearm and foot plantar surface of the newborns. A multivariate regression model was adjusted to determine the correlation of GA with skin layer dimensions. The best model to correlate skin thickness with GA was fitted using the epidermal layer on the forearm site, adjusted to cofactors, as follows: Gestational age (weeks) = −28.0 + 12.8 &lt;i&gt;Ln&lt;/i&gt; (Thickness) − 4.4 Incubator staying; &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.604 (P&amp;lt;0.001). In this model, the constant value for the standard of fetal growth was statistically null. The dermal layer thickness on the forearm and plantar surfaces had a negative moderate linear correlation with GA (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = −0.370, P&amp;lt;0.001 and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; = −0.421, P&amp;lt;0.001, respectively). The univariate statistical analyses revealed the influence of underweight and overweight profiles on neonatal skin thickness at birth. Of the 222 infants, 53 (23.9%) had inappropriate fetal growths expected for their GA. Epidermal thickness was not fetal growth standard dependent as follows: 172.2 (19.8) μm for adequate for GA, 171.4 (20.6) μm for SGA, and 177.7 (15.2) μm for LGA (P = 0.525, mean [SD] on the forearm).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The analysis highlights a new opportunity to relate GA at birth to neonatal skin layer thickness.

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197413</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559164:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

Large-scale insertional mutagenesis screens can be powerful genome-wide tools if they are streamlined with efficient downstream analysis, which is a serious bottleneck in complex biological systems. A major impediment to the success of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based screens for virulence factors is that the genetic material of pathogens is often underrepresented within the eukaryotic host, making detection extremely challenging. We therefore established insertion Pool-Sequencing (iPool-Seq) on maize infected with the biotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maydis&lt;/i&gt;. iPool-Seq features tagmentation, unique molecular barcodes, and affinity purification of pathogen insertion mutant DNA from in vivo-infected tissues. In a proof of concept using iPool-Seq, we identified 28 virulence factors, including 23 that were previously uncharacterized, from an initial pool of 195 candidate effector mutants. Because of its sensitivity and quantitative nature, iPool-Seq can be applied to any insertional mutagenesis library and is especially suitable for genetically complex setups like pooled infections of eukaryotic hosts.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/I200kmApCCw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162f3ad5b12:38e8b3:76251cdd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon Uhse, Florian G.

Constrained Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (Cons_SaDE) algorithm is used to find the minimum energy conformation using proposed constraints such as boundary surface complementary interactions, non-bonded inter-atomic allowed distances, and finding of interaction and non-interaction sites. With these constraints, Cons_SaDE is efficient enough to explore the promising solutions by gradually self-adapting the strategies and parameters learnt from their previous experiences. Modified sampling scheme called Rotate Only Representation is used to represent a docking conformation. GROMOS53A6 force field is used to find the potential energy. To test the performance of this algorithm, few bound and unbound complexes from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and few easy, medium and difficult complexes from Zlab benchmark4.0 are used. Buried Surface Area, Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Correlation Coefficient are some of the metrics applied to evaluate the best docked conformations.

Constrained Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (Cons_SaDE) algorithm is used to find the minimum energy conformation using proposed constraints such as boundary surface complementary interactions, non-bonded inter-atomic allowed distances, and finding of interaction and non-interaction sites. With these constraints, Cons_SaDE is efficient enough to explore the promising solutions by gradually self-adapting the strategies and parameters learnt from their previous experiences. Modified sampling scheme called Rotate Only Representation is used to represent a docking conformation. GROMOS53A6 force field is used to find the potential energy. To test the performance of this algorithm, few bound and unbound complexes from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and few easy, medium and difficult complexes from Zlab benchmark4.0 are used. Buried Surface Area, Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) and Correlation Coefficient are some of the metrics applied to evaluate the best docked conformations. RMSD values of the best docked conformations obtained from five popular docking web servers are compared with Cons_SaDE results and nonparametric statistical tests for multiple comparisons with control method are implemented to show the performance of this algorithm. Cons_SaDE has produced good quality solutions for the most of the data sets considered.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</link><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.17.full</canonicalUrl><author><name>Fahrenkamp-Uppenbrink, J.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Knowing how to prevent induced earthquakes</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>e278b830</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-q?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d2:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/252?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6386/252.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/252?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Wade, L.</name></author><published>1524159423000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Ancient DNA untangles South Asian roots</title><crawled>1524160533249</crawled><fingerprint>3a2a38cc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6386/252?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Anthropology, Asia/Pacific News, Evolution, Genetics</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_162df0c1301:449d6c7:34f43e70</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>115</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315903v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/07/315903</canonicalUrl><author><name>Zitnik, M.</name></author><published>1525676400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Prioritizing network communities [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1525711595031</crawled><fingerprint>565df334</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/315903v1?rss=1</originId><description>Uncovering modular structure in networks is fundamental for advancing the understanding of complex systems in biology, physics, engineering, and technology.

During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>15</engagement><engagementRate>1.25</engagementRate><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636f3e460d:51f32:d63e3ae2</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;

We explore using word and sentence embedding approaches for nucleotide sequences since they may be a suitable numerical representation for downstream machine learning applications (especially deep learning). This work involves first encoding (&apos;&apos;embedding&apos;&apos;) each sequence into a dense, low-dimensional, numeric vector space. Here, we use Skip-Gram word2vec to embed {kappa}-mers, obtained from 16S rRNA amplicon surveys, and then leverage an existing sentence embedding technique to embed all sequences belonging to specific body sites or samples. We demonstrate that these representations are biologically meaningful, and hence the embedding space can be exploited as a form of feature extraction for exploratory analysis. We show that sequence embeddings preserve relevant information about the sequencing data such as {kappa}-mer context, sequence taxonomy, and sample class. Specifically, the sequence embedding space resolved differences among phyla, as well as differences among genera within the same family. Distances between sequence embeddings had similar qualities to distances between alignment identities, and embedding multiple sequences can be thought of as generating a consensus sequence. Using sample embeddings for body site classification resulted in negligible performance loss compared to using OTU abundance data. Lastly, the {kappa}-mer embedding space captured distinct {kappa}-mer profiles that mapped to specific regions of the 16S rRNA gene and corresponded with particular body sites. Together, our results show that embedding sequences results in meaningful representations that can be used for exploratory analyses or for downstream machine learning applications that require numeric data. Moreover, because the embeddings are trained in an unsupervised manner, unlabeled data can be embedded and used to bolster supervised machine learning tasks.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314260v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1632c295b4c:17004e0:5785ab88</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Advances in high-throughput sequencing have increased the availability of microbiome sequencing data that can be exploited to characterize microbiome community structure in situ.

The present study aimed to identify novel microbial producers of bioemulsificant compounds from Antarctic soils. Fifty-nine microbial strains were isolated from five different locations at South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, and screened for biosurfactant production by β-hemolytic activity. Strain So 3.2 was determined as bioemulsifier-producer and identified by phenotypic and molecular characterization as &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt;. Emulsification activity, oil displacement method and drop-collapsing test were performed to evaluate the biosurfactant activity with different oils and hydrocarbons using two different culture media (Luria Bertani and Bushnell Haas in the presence of different carbon sources: glucose, glycerol, olive oil and n-Hexadecane). Cell free supernatant of Bushnell Haas culture supplemented with n-Hexadecane showed the best results for all tests. Emulsification of hydrocarbons exceeded 60%, reaching up to 90% on oil with high API grade, while displacement tests ranged from 8 cm to 4 cm in diameter according the culture media and tested oils. Our results revealed that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces luridus&lt;/i&gt; So3.2 is able to produce bioemulsifiers capable of emulsifying hydrocarbons and oils, which could be used in different biotechnological applications, particularly for bioremediation of environments contaminated by oil leaks.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196054</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb93:7d6c1c1c</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Lamilla, Douglas Braga, Rui Castro, Carolina Guimarães, Livia V.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine whether earlier time to initiation of aerobic exercise following acute concussion is associated with time to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A retrospective stratified propensity score survival analysis of acute (≤14 days) concussion was used to determine whether time (days) to initiation of aerobic exercise post-concussion was associated with, both, time (days) to full return to (1) sport and (2) school or work.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 253 acute concussions [median (IQR) age, 17.0 (15.0–20.0) years; 148 (58.5%) males] were included in this study. Multivariate Cox regression models identified that earlier time to aerobic exercise was associated with faster return to sport and school/work adjusting for other covariates, including quintile propensity strata. For each successive day in delay to initiation of aerobic exercise, individuals had a less favourable recovery trajectory. Initiating aerobic exercise at 3 and 7 days following injury was associated with a respective 36.5% (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53–0.76) and 73.2% (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.16–0.45) reduced probability of faster full return to sport compared to within 1 day; and a respective 45.9% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44–0.66) and 83.1% (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.10–0.30) reduced probability of faster full return to school/work. Additionally, concussion history, symptom severity, LOC deleteriously influenced concussion recovery.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Earlier initiation of aerobic exercise was associated with faster full return to sport and school or work.

Thus, quantitative analysis of changes in size and shape of nuclear structures in 3D microscopic images is important not only for investigating nuclear organization, but also for detecting and treating pathological conditions such as cancer. While many efforts have been made to develop cell and nuclear shape characteristics in 2D or pseudo-3D, several studies have suggested that 3D morphometric measures provide better results for nuclear shape description and discrimination. A few methods have been proposed to classify cell and nuclear morphological phenotypes in 3D, however, there is a lack of publicly available 3D data for the evaluation and comparison of such algorithms. This limitation becomes of great importance when the ability to evaluate different approaches on benchmark data is needed for better dissemination of the current state of the art methods for bioimage analysis.

In addition, we perform a baseline evaluation of a number of popular classification algorithms using 2D and 3D voxel-based morphometric measures.

A major roadblock to clinically relevant, safe, and robust TE solutions has been the high complexity and variability inherent to bioengineering approaches that rely on cell-driven tissue remodeling.

Beyond previous studies, this work suggests the relevance of an integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo bioengineering approach as a basis for the safe and efficient clinical translation of TEHVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>65</engagement></item><item><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.14.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Giving a hand to metamaterials</title><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><fingerprint>7b2a899e</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><keywords><item>Engineering, Materials Science</item></keywords><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d5:93d646dc</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004786</link><recrawled>1525375448507</recrawled><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/_c4txNHahJg/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Aiko Yoshida</name></author><published>1525381200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Morphological changes of plasma membrane and protein assembly during clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title><updated>1525381200000</updated><crawled>1525370092024</crawled><fingerprint>9bf22316</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004786</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aiko Yoshida, Nobuaki Sakai, Yoshitsugu Uekusa, Yuka Imaoka, Yoshitsuna Itagaki, Yuki Suzuki, Shige H.

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) proceeds through a series of morphological changes of the plasma membrane induced by a number of protein components. Although the spatiotemporal assembly of these proteins has been elucidated by fluorescence-based techniques, the protein-induced morphological changes of the plasma membrane have not been fully clarified in living cells. Here, we visualize membrane morphology together with protein localizations during CME by utilizing high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) combined with a confocal laser scanning unit. The plasma membrane starts to invaginate approximately 30 s after clathrin starts to assemble, and the aperture diameter increases as clathrin accumulates. Actin rapidly accumulates around the pit and induces a small membrane swelling, which, within 30 s, rapidly covers the pit irreversibly. Inhibition of actin turnover abolishes the swelling and induces a reversible open–close motion of the pit, indicating that actin dynamics are necessary for efficient and irreversible pit closure at the end of CME.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_c4txNHahJg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>2</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163272479f8:1446:a96d255</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aiko Yoshida, Nobuaki Sakai, Yoshitsugu Uekusa, Yuka Imaoka, Yoshitsuna Itagaki, Yuki Suzuki, Shige H.

Flynn, David O. F. Skibinski, Christian Lindemann&lt;/p&gt;
Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and a half-saturation constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (&lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;, the value of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. The ability of cells to modulate the &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt; according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>2</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8d:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin J.

Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and a half-saturation constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (&lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;, the value of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. The ability of cells to modulate the &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt; according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196929</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475056:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4749.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/18/4749</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/18.cover-source.jpg?itok=V2AnzLfA</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>359</width></visual><author><name>Eunseon Ahn, Koichi Araki, Masao Hashimoto, Weiyan Li, James L.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of retrospective studies that investigated the association of preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels with the overall survival (OS) of patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A detailed literature search was performed in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed databases up to August 28, 2017, for related research publications written in English. We extracted the data from these studies and combined the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the correlation between CRP levels and OS in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Five studies with a total of 816 participants from several countries were enrolled in this current meta-analysis. In a pooled analysis of all the publications, increased serum CRP levels had an adverse prognostic effect on the overall survival of patients with bone neoplasms. However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms. More prospective studies are needed to confirm the prognostic significance of CRP levels in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt;</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195769</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb3:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Wenyi Li, Xujun Luo, Zhongyue Liu, Yanqiao Chen, Zhihong Li&lt;/p&gt;

However, the combined data showed no significant relationship between the level of CRP and OS in Asian patients (HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.86–3.49; P = 0.125). Similar trends were observed in patients with bone neoplasms when stratified by ethnicity, histology, metastasis and study sample size.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results of this meta-analysis suggest that increased CRP expression indicates a poorer prognosis in patients with bone neoplasms. More prospective studies are needed to confirm the prognostic significance of CRP levels in patients with bone neoplasms.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197705</link><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197705</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197705</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Franziska Zeyer</name></author><published>1526418000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Correction: mRNA-Mediated Gene Supplementation of Toll-Like Receptors as Treatment Strategy for Asthma &amp;lt;i&gt;In Vivo&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><updated>1526418000000</updated><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><fingerprint>c1a808ec</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197705</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franziska Zeyer, Benedikt Mothes, Clara Will, Melanie Carevic, Jennifer Rottenberger, Bernd Nürnberg, Dominik Hartl, Rupert Handgretinger, Sandra Beer-Hammer, Michael S.

We compared the clinical characteristics, treatments, and prognoses of fungal keratitis in patients with and without diabetes. Patients diagnosed with fungal keratitis at Shandong Eye Institute between January 2010 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed and classified as diabetic and nondiabetic groups. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (111 eyes) with diabetes and 740 patients (740 eyes) without diabetes were included. The diabetic patients showed significantly older (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.05) and lower male:female ratio (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). Plants trauma was the primary risk factor in both groups, and there was no significant difference of pathogen type (the most common was &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; genus, followed by &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; genera). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that diabetes and topical glucocorticoid use were the independent risk factors for the severity of fungal keratitis. The recurrent infection rate between the diabetic and nondiabetic patients during the follow-up (6 to 24 months) after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was not significantly different. Although the recurrent epithelial defect, rejection, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar between the patients with matched bed/graft size (7.75/8.0 mm) in the two groups 1 year after PKP, the incidence of delayed re-epithelialization (&gt;7 days) was significantly higher in diabetic patients (3/10 versus 2/43 in nondiabetic patients, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). More specially, the diabetic patients with the duration ≥10 years showed more significantly delayed re-epithelialization than those with the diabetic duration less than 10 years (3/5 versus 1/26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, the diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor that affect the severity of fungal keratitis. Corneal re-epithelialization was significantly delayed after PKP in the diabetic patients, especially with the duration ≥10 years.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196741</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1631cdf43f9:2696a6e:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Dan, Qingjun Zhou, Hualei Zhai, Jun Cheng, Lei Wan, Cheng Ge, Lixin Xie&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, we linked the two-gene ‘cardiac glycoside reductase’ (&lt;i&gt;cgr&lt;/i&gt;) operon encoded by the gut Actinobacterium &lt;i&gt;Eggerthella lenta&lt;/i&gt; to inactivation of the cardiac medication and plant natural product digoxin. Here, we compared the genomes of 25 &lt;i&gt;E. lenta&lt;/i&gt; strains and close relatives, revealing an expanded 8-gene &lt;i&gt;cgr&lt;/i&gt;-associated gene cluster present in all digoxin metabolizers and absent in non-metabolizers. Using heterologous expression and in vitro biochemical characterization, we discovered that a single flavin- and [4Fe-4S] cluster-dependent reductase, Cgr2, is sufficient for digoxin inactivation.

Recently, we linked the two-gene ‘cardiac glycoside reductase’ (&lt;i&gt;cgr&lt;/i&gt;) operon encoded by the gut Actinobacterium &lt;i&gt;Eggerthella lenta&lt;/i&gt; to inactivation of the cardiac medication and plant natural product digoxin. Here, we compared the genomes of 25 &lt;i&gt;E. lenta&lt;/i&gt; strains and close relatives, revealing an expanded 8-gene &lt;i&gt;cgr&lt;/i&gt;-associated gene cluster present in all digoxin metabolizers and absent in non-metabolizers. Using heterologous expression and in vitro biochemical characterization, we discovered that a single flavin- and [4Fe-4S] cluster-dependent reductase, Cgr2, is sufficient for digoxin inactivation. Unexpectedly, Cgr2 displayed strict specificity for digoxin and other cardenolides. Quantification of &lt;i&gt;cgr2&lt;/i&gt; in gut microbiomes revealed that this gene is widespread and conserved in the human population. Together, these results demonstrate that human-associated gut bacteria maintain specialized enzymes that protect against ingested plant toxins.</description><engagement>91</engagement></item><item><published>1525881732000</published><link>http://rss.sciencedirect.com/action/redirectFile?&amp;zone=main&amp;currentActivity=feed&amp;usageType=outward&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Fscience%3F_ob%3DGatewayURL%26_origin%3DIRSSSEARCH%26_method%3DcitationSearch%26_piikey%3DS2405471218301078%26_version%3D1%26md5%3D8389f9bbeaf1a53356b0e1451365fbae</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2405471218301078-fx1.jpg</url><height>375</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>375</width></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218301078</canonicalUrl><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Publication date: &lt;span&gt;Available online 9 May 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt;Cell Systems&lt;br&gt; Author(s): John Salamon, Xiaoyan Qian, Mats Nilsson, David John Lynn&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; sequencing methods generate spatially resolved RNA localization and expression data at an almost single-cell resolution.

Visual estimation of the material and shape of an object from a single image includes a hard ill-posed computational problem. However, in our daily life we feel we can estimate both reasonably well. The neural computation underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here we propose that the human visual system uses different aspects of object images to separately estimate the contributions of the material and shape. Specifically, material perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient magnitude information, while shape perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient order information. A clue to this hypothesis was provided by the observation that luminance-histogram manipulation, which changes luminance gradient magnitudes but not the luminance-order map, effectively alters the material appearance but not the shape of an object. In agreement with this observation, we found that the simulated physical material changes do not significantly affect the intensity order information. A series of psychophysical experiments further indicate that human surface shape perception is robust against intensity manipulations provided they do not disturb the intensity order information. In addition, we show that the two types of gradient information can be utilized for the discrimination of albedo changes from highlights. These findings suggest that the visual system relies on these diagnostic image features to estimate physical properties in a distal world.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiqJxpkZuOw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>41</engagement><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16308310122:44e8b:ed160cc3</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Masataka Sawayama, Shin&apos;ya Nishida&lt;/p&gt;

Visual stimuli evoke activity in visual cortical neuronal populations. Neuronal activity can be selectively modulated by particular visual stimulus parameters, such as the direction of a moving bar of light, resulting in well-defined trial averaged tuning properties. However, given any single stimulus parameter, a large number of neurons in visual cortex remain unmodulated, and the role of this untuned population is not well understood. Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging to record, in an unbiased manner, from large populations of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex to describe co-varying activity on single trials in neuronal populations consisting of both tuned and untuned neurons.

We investigated differences in the achievement of glycemic control among newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients according to gender using a multi-clinic retrospective cohort study. Optimal glycemic control was defined as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of less than 6.5% after 1 year of diabetes management. A generalized linear mixed model, which controlled for the fixed effects of baseline characteristics and prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent (OHA), was used to calculate the probability of achieving the target HbA1c. The study included 2,253 newly diagnosed type-2 diabetes patients who completed 1 year of diabetic management, including OHA, in the 36 participating primary clinics. Within the study population, the women had an older average age, were less likely to smoke or drink alcohol, and showed lower levels of fasting blood glucose and HbA1c at the time of diagnosis. There were no significant differences by sex in prescribed OHA or median number of visits. After 1 year of diabetes management, 38.9% of women and 40.6% of men achieved the target HbA1c—a small but significant difference. This suggests that type-2 diabetes is managed less well in women than in men.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196719</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a188:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung-Ah Choe, Joo Yeong Kim, Young Sun Ro, Sung-Il Cho&lt;/p&gt;

There were no significant differences by sex in prescribed OHA or median number of visits. After 1 year of diabetes management, 38.9% of women and 40.6% of men achieved the target HbA1c—a small but significant difference. This suggests that type-2 diabetes is managed less well in women than in men.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</link><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Doris H.

Anemia commonly occurs in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The management of patients with anemia in CKD is challenging, due to its severity, frequent hypo-responsiveness to treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) and common hemoglobin cycling. Nonlinear dose-response curves and long delays in the effect of treatment on red blood cell population size complicate predictions of hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in individual patients. A comprehensive physiology based mathematical model for erythropoiesis was adapted individually to 60 hemodialysis patients treated with ESAs by identifying physiologically meaningful key model parameters from temporal Hgb data. Crit-Line&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; III monitors provided non-invasive Hgb measurements for every hemodialysis treatment. We used Hgb data during a 150-day baseline period together to estimate a patient’s individual red blood cell lifespan, effects of the ESA on proliferation of red cell progenitor cells, endogenous erythropoietin production and ESA half-life. Estimated patient specific parameters showed excellent alignment with previously conducted clinical studies in hemodialysis patients. Further, the model qualitatively and quantitatively reflected empirical hemoglobin dynamics in demographically, anthropometrically and clinically diverse patients and accurately predicted the Hgb response to ESA therapy in individual patients for up to 21 weeks. The findings suggest that estimated model parameters can be used as a proxy for parameters that are clinically very difficult to quantify. The presented method has the potential to provide new insights into the individual pathophysiology of renal anemia and its association with clinical outcomes and can potentially be used to guide personalized anemia treatment.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195918</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccba:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Doris H.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery.

Inflammation causes nociceptive sensory neuron activation, evoking debilitating symptoms and reflexes. Inflammatory signaling pathways are capable of modulating mitochondrial function, resulting in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial depolarization and calcium release. Previously we showed that mitochondrial modulation with antimycin A, a complex III inhibitor, selectively stimulated nociceptive bronchopulmonary C-fibers via the activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) ankyrin 1 (A1) and vanilloid 1 (V1) cation channels. TRPA1 is ROS-sensitive, but there is little evidence that TRPV1 is activated by ROS. Here, we used dual imaging of dissociated vagal neurons to investigate the correlation of mitochondrial superoxide production (mitoSOX) or mitochondrial depolarization (JC-1) with cytosolic calcium (Fura-2AM), following mitochondrial modulation by antimycin A, rotenone (complex I inhibitor) and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP, mitochondrial uncoupling agent). Mitochondrial modulation by all agents selectively increased cytosolic calcium in a subset of TRPA1/TRPV1-expressing (A1/V1+) neurons. There was a significant correlation between antimycin A-induced calcium responses and mitochondrial superoxide in wild-type ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons, which was eliminated in TRPA1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, but not TRPV1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Nevertheless, antimycin A-induced superoxide production did not always increase calcium in A1/V1+ neurons, suggesting a critical role of an unknown factor. CCCP caused both superoxide production and mitochondrial depolarization but neither correlated with calcium fluxes in A1/V1+ neurons. Rotenone-induced calcium responses in ‘responding’ A1/V1+ neurons correlated with mitochondrial depolarization but not superoxide production. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction causes calcium fluxes in a subset of A1/V1+ neurons via ROS-dependent and ROS-independent mechanisms.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197106</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1633baf80e8:2b4226b:5785ab88</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katherine R.

Microbicides are an important strategy for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV but, so far, the most advanced tenofovir-based microbicides have had modest efficacy. This has been related to adherence problems and high prevalence of tenofovir-resistant HIV-1 strains. P3 is a new peptide with potent activity against HIV that may be a good microbicide candidate. In this work P3 was formulated in a gel of hydroxyethyl cellulose and its activity, stability and safety profile in Balb/c mice were evaluated. HIV infection was fully blocked by a 1.5% gel containing P3 at the IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; (366.4 nM) concentration. The antiviral activity did not change at 4°C during 4 months and at 25, 37 and 65°C for 1 week. P3 was stable and fully functional at acidic pH up to 24h, under different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and in the presence of genital fluids up to 48h. P3 had no antibacterial activity and did not affect sperm motility and vitality. Finally, P3 didn’t cause significant alterations in the vaginal epithelium of Balb/c mice at 0.06 (456.8 μM) and 0.2 mg/day (1522.7 μM) doses. These findings indicate that P3 is an excellent candidate for further development as a microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV transmission in women.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195744</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162d9dc2dbf:3c3ccb1:34f43e70</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Inês Bártolo, Ana Rita Diniz, Pedro Borrego, João Pedro Ferreira, Maria Rosário Bronze, Helena Barroso, Rui Pinto, Carlos Cardoso, João F.

Immunogenicity is a major concern in drug development as anti-drug antibodies in many cases affect both patient safety and drug efficacy. Another concern is often the limited half-life of drugs, which can be altered by different chemical modifications, like acylation with fatty acids. However, acylation with fatty acids has been shown in some cases to modulate T cell activation. Therefore, to understand the role of acylation with fatty acids on immunogenicity we tested three immunogenic non-acylated peptides and 14 of their acylated analogues for binding to 26 common HLA class II alleles, and their ability to activate T cells in an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; T cell assay. Changes in binding affinity associated with acylation with fatty acids were typically modest, though a significant decrease was observed for influenza HA acylated with a stearic acid, and affinities for DQ alleles were consistently increased. Importantly, we showed that for all three immunogenic peptides acylation with fatty acids decreased their capacity to activate T cells, a trend particularly evident with longer fatty acids typically positioned within the peptide HLA class II binding core region, or when closer to the C-terminus. With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197407</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a21a1:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Heidi S.

With these results we have demonstrated that acylation with fatty acids of immunogenic peptides can lower their stimulatory capacity, which could be important knowledge for drug design and immunogenicity mitigation.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><published>1525369184000</published><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/eaat9919?rss=1</link><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/eaat9919.full</canonicalUrl><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Erratum for the Report &quot;Seasonal and daily climate variation have opposite effects on species elevational range size&quot; by W.-P.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>1</engagement></item><item><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4006.short?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/17/E4006</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Constanza de la Fuente, Maria C.

There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing.

There are only few reports regarding the role of lifetime drug or substance use in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of drug or substance exposure on the onset of MS diagnosis. We conducted a population-based incident case control study in Tehran. Cases (n = 547) were 15–50 years old persons with MS identified from the Iranian Multiple Sclerosis Society (IMSS) register during August 7, 2013, and November 17, 2015. Population-based controls (n = 1057) were 15–50 years old and were recruited by random digit telephone dialing. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighing (IPTW) using two sets of propensity scores (PSs) was used to estimate marginal incidence odds ratios (ORs) for MS contrasting pre-specified substance use. The estimated marginal OR was 6.03 (95% confidence interval: 3.54;10.3, using trimmed weights at the 95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile of the stabilized weight distribution) in both IPTW analyses comparing lifetime substance use (opioids, cannabis, inhalants, hallucinogens and stimulants) for at least one time monthly during a six-months or longer period vs. no such history of drug use. Subject to limitation of causal claims based on case-control studies, this study suggests that monthly drug or substance use for a period of at least six consecutive months, may increase the risk of MS by factor 3.5 or higher.</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05049-5</link><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05049-5/d41586-018-05049-5_15731608.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><width>1024</width></visual><author><name>Todd C.

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; microenvironment of bacterial pathogens is often characterized by nutrient limitation. Consequently, conventional rich &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture conditions used widely to evaluate antibacterial agents are often poorly predictive of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity, especially for agents targeting metabolic pathways. In one such pathway, the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, which is essential for production of isoprenoids in bacterial pathogens, relatively little is known about the influence of growth environment on antibacterial properties of inhibitors targeting enzymes in this pathway. The early steps of the MEP pathway are catalyzed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) synthase and reductoisomerase (IspC). The in vitro antibacterial efficacy of the DXP synthase inhibitor butylacetylphosphonate (BAP) was recently reported to be strongly dependent upon growth medium, with high potency observed under nutrient limitation and exceedingly weak activity in nutrient-rich conditions. In contrast, the well-known IspC inhibitor fosmidomycin has potent antibacterial activity in nutrient-rich conditions, but to date, its efficacy had not been explored under more relevant nutrient-limited conditions. The goal of this work was to thoroughly characterize the effects of BAP and fosmidomycin on bacterial cells under varied growth conditions. In this work, we show that activities of both inhibitors, alone and in combination, are strongly dependent upon growth medium, with differences in cellular uptake contributing to variance in potency of both agents. Fosmidomycin is dissimilar to BAP in that it displays relatively weaker activity in nutrient-limited compared to nutrient-rich conditions. Interestingly, while it has been generally accepted that fosmidomycin activity depends upon expression of the GlpT transporter, our results indicate for the first time that fosmidomycin can enter cells by an alternative mechanism under nutrient limitation. Finally, we show that the potency and relationship of the BAP-fosmidomycin combination also depends upon the growth medium, revealing a striking loss of BAP-fosmidomycin synergy under nutrient limitation. This change in BAP-fosmidomycin relationship suggests a shift in the metabolic and/or regulatory networks surrounding DXP accompanying the change in growth medium, the understanding of which could significantly impact targeting strategies against this pathway. More generally, our findings emphasize the importance of considering physiologically relevant growth conditions for predicting the antibacterial potential MEP pathway inhibitors and for studies of their intracellular targets.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197638</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8543b:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sara Sanders, David Bartee, Mackenzie J.

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7222:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to impinge on telomere homeostasis in a number of ways. However, the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction of viruses with the telomere homeostasis apparatus has not been previously explored. Since E6 and E7 are the main viral oncogenes and key for viral replication, we have explored here the short-term phenotypes of the genes in the context of defective telomere homeostasis. We examined the short-term phenotypes of E6 and E7 in a context where the Terc component of the telomerase holoenzyme was knocked out. We determined that Terc was dispensable for most oncogene-mediated phenotypes. Surprisingly, E7-mediated reduction of label retaining cells was found to be in part dependent on the presence of Terc. Under the conditions examined here, there appears to be no compelling evidence Terc is required for most short-term viral oncogene mediated phenotypes. Further studies will elucidate its role in longer-term phenotypes.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196604</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1630319f428:3eefba:11c251fd</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Charis Achilleos, Stella Michael, Katerina Strati&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have explored differences in the determinants of individual dietary/energy intake patterns between urban and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine whether the associations between individual characteristics and dietary/energy intake patterns differ between urban and rural areas in West Java, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A 3-day weighed food record, interviews, and anthropometric measurements were conducted in Bandung (urban area; n = 85) and Sumedang (rural area; n = 201). Total energy intake and intake from protein, fat, and carbohydrates were calculated. Food items were grouped into dietary categories based on the main ingredients to calculate their share of total energy intake. The associations between individual characteristics and dietary/energy intake were examined by fitting regression models. Models that also included education and body mass index (BMI) were fitted to adult samples only.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In Sumedang, the total energy intake and energy intake from carbohydrates, fat, and grain/tubers were significantly associated with age and occupation.

Background &lt;p&gt;Few studies have explored differences in the determinants of individual dietary/energy intake patterns between urban and rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine whether the associations between individual characteristics and dietary/energy intake patterns differ between urban and rural areas in West Java, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A 3-day weighed food record, interviews, and anthropometric measurements were conducted in Bandung (urban area; n = 85) and Sumedang (rural area; n = 201). Total energy intake and intake from protein, fat, and carbohydrates were calculated. Food items were grouped into dietary categories based on the main ingredients to calculate their share of total energy intake. The associations between individual characteristics and dietary/energy intake were examined by fitting regression models. Models that also included education and body mass index (BMI) were fitted to adult samples only.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In Sumedang, the total energy intake and energy intake from carbohydrates, fat, and grain/tubers were significantly associated with age and occupation. In Bandung, energy intake from grain/tubers and vegetables/legumes was related to sex and occupation, while other indicators showed no associations. Among adults, BMI was associated with the total energy intake and educational level was associated with energy intake from vegetables/legumes (both only in Sumedang).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The relationship between demographic and socioeconomic factors and dietary/energy intake patterns differs in rural versus urban areas in West Java. These results suggest that different strategies are needed in rural and urban areas to identify and aid populations at risk of diet-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/437/eaat4477.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Lujambio, A.</name></author><published>1524073687000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>[Editors&apos; Choice] A (synthetic) lethal weapon for cancer</title><crawled>1524075079110</crawled><fingerprint>7184314f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;ROS1 inhibition in E-cadherin–deficient tumors leads to synthetic lethality, which could be exploited for the selective treatment of breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/437/eaat4477?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>wnkrsZvJ/I8FcpnJN66aQJEbdeWdw7Fc0LoIj490v/0=_162d9f425c6:3bd58ce:7d6c1c1c</id><origin><streamId>feed/http://stm.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science Translational Medicine current issue</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;ROS1 inhibition in E-cadherin–deficient tumors leads to synthetic lethality, which could be exploited for the selective treatment of breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><engagement>0</engagement></item><item><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325522v1?rss=1</link><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/325522</canonicalUrl><author><name>Moshiri, N.</name></author><published>1526626800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>TreeSwift: a massively scalable Python package for trees [NEW RESULTS]</title><crawled>1526653655587</crawled><fingerprint>1dbf43e1</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325522v1?rss=1</originId><description>Background: Phylogenetic trees are essential to evolutionary biology, and numerous methods exist that attempt to extract information applicable to a wide range of disciplines, such as epidemiology and metagenomics.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) regulates genes in many physiological pathways by binding to enhancer and silencer elements of target genes, where it recruits coregulator proteins that remodel chromatin and regulate the assembly of transcription complexes. The coregulator Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 (Hic-5) is necessary for glucocorticoid (GC) regulation of one group of GR target genes, is irrelevant for a second group, and inhibits GR binding to a third gene set, thereby blocking their regulation by GC. Gene-specific characteristics that distinguish GR binding regions (GBR) at Hic-5 blocked genes from GBR at other GC-regulated genes are unknown. Here we show genome-wide that blocked GBR generally require CHD9 and BRM for GR occupancy in contrast to GBR that are not blocked by Hic-5. Hic-5 blocked GBR are enriched near Hic-5 blocked GR target genes but not near GR target genes that are not blocked by Hic-5. Furthermore blocked GBR are in a closed conformation prior to Hic-5 depletion, and require Hic-5 depletion and glucocorticoid treatment to create an open conformation necessary for GR occupancy. A transcription factor binding motif characteristic of the ETS family was enriched near blocked GBR and blocked genes but not near non-blocked GBR or non-blocked GR target genes. Thus, we identify specific differences in chromatin conformation, chromatin remodeler requirements, and local DNA sequence motifs that contribute to gene-specific actions of transcription factors and coregulators. These findings shed light on mechanisms that contribute to binding site selection by transcription factors, which vary in a cell type-specific manner.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196965</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47505b:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Brian H.

Long reads, which are nowadays cheaper to produce and more widely available than ever before, have been used to reduce the fragmentation of the assembled haplotypes since their ability to span several variants along the genome. These long reads are also characterized by a high error rate, an issue which may be mitigated, however, with larger sets of reads, when this error rate is uniform across genome positions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art dynamic programming approaches designed for long reads deal only with limited coverages. Results: Here, we propose a new method for assembling haplotypes which combines and extends the features of previous approaches to deal with long reads and higher coverages. In particular, our algorithm is able to dynamically adapt the estimated number of errors at each variant site, while minimizing the total number of error corrections necessary for finding a feasible solution. This allows our method to significantly reduce the required computational resources, allowing to consider datasets composed of higher coverages. The algorithm has been implemented in a freely available tool, HapCHAT: Haplotype Assembly Coverage Handling by Adapting Thresholds. An experimental analysis on sequencing reads with up to 60x coverage reveals improvements in accuracy and recall achieved by considering a higher coverage with lower runtimes. Conclusions: Our method leverages the long-range information of sequencing reads that allows to obtain assembled haplotypes fragmented in a lower number of unphased haplotype blocks. At the same time, our method is also able to deal with higher coverages to better correct the errors in the original reads and to obtain more accurate haplotypes as a result.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To assess whether embryonic DNA isolated from blastocyst culture conditioned medium (BCCM) combined with blastocoel fluid (BF) could be used for blastocyst stage non-invasive preimplantation genetic testing for chromosomal aneuploidy (non-invasive preimplantation genetic screening, NIPGS).&lt;/p&gt; Patients &lt;p&gt;47 embryos from 35 patients undergoing IVF.&lt;/p&gt; Interventions &lt;p&gt;DNA analysis of combined BCCM plus BF in comparison with trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and/or whole blastocyst (WB)using next generation sequencing (NGS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Embryonic DNA was successfully amplified in 47/47 NIPGS samples (28 frozen-thawed and 19 fresh culture samples) ranging from 6.3 to 44.0 ng/μl.

Metformin, the medicine most commonly prescribed for treatment of Type II diabetes, is among the most abundant pharmaceuticals being introduced into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are increasingly found in wastewater and surface waters around the world, often due to incomplete metabolism in humans and subsequent excretion in human waste. Risk analyses and exposure studies have raised concerns about potential negative impacts of pharmaceuticals at current environmental levels. Results of the present study indicate that metformin at concentrations in the range of what has been documented in freshwater systems and waste-water effluent (40 μg/L) affects aggressive behavior in adult male &lt;i&gt;Betta splendens&lt;/i&gt;. Subjects exhibited less aggression toward a male dummy stimulus after four weeks exposure to metformin-treated water when compared to behavior measured immediately prior to their exposure, and in comparison to a separate cohort of un-exposed control fish. This effect persisted after 20 weeks exposure as well. Subjects exposed to metformin at a concentration twice that currently observed in nature (80 μg/L) exhibited an even more substantial reduction in aggressive behaviors compared to controls and pre-exposure measurements than those observed in the low-dose treatment group. Such changes in behavior have the potential to affect male fitness and possibly impact the health of natural populations of aquatic organisms exposed to the drug.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197259</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b7a:93d646dc</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ronald David MacLaren, Kathryn Wisniewski, Christina MacLaren&lt;/p&gt;

Experimental infiltrations revealed a high heterogeneity in peptide tolerance among native isolates and suggests that the diversity of natural microbial communities can be a major obstacle for microbiome manipulations in nature.</description><engagement>64</engagement></item><item><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25858-y</link><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/dBkk_-V5SO0/s41598-018-25858-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Dominik Dornfeld</name></author><published>1526281200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><title>Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses</title><crawled>1526287291961</crawled><fingerprint>6b5b7b96</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25858-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25858-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25858-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dBkk_-V5SO0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635dcfd639:2eca3ee:2835af05</id><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25858-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25858-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: SMARCA2-regulated host cell factors are required for MxA restriction of influenza A viruses&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/dBkk_-V5SO0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25858-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical></item><item><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acschembio.7b01048</link><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/acbcct/~3/W592P748xyE/acschembio.7b01048</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><author><name>Andreja Kust, Jan Mareš, Jouni Jokela, Petra Urajová, Jan Hájek, Kumar Saurav, Katerina Vorácová, David P.

Few studies have estimated the economic burden of chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) attributable to unhealthy eating. In this study, we estimated the economic burden of chronic disease attributable to not meeting Canadian food recommendations. We first obtained chronic disease risk estimates for intakes of both protective (1. vegetables; 2. fruit; 3. whole grains; 4. milk; 5. nuts and seeds) and harmful (6. processed meat; 7. red meat; 8. sugar-sweetened beverages) foods from the Global Burden of Disease Study, and food intakes from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey 24-hour dietary recalls (n = 33,932 respondents). We then calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all relevant food-chronic disease combinations by age and sex groups. These PAFs were then mathematically combined for each disease for each age and sex group. We then estimated attributable costs by multiplying these combined PAFs with estimated 2014 annual direct health care (hospital, drug, physician) and indirect (human capital approach) costs for each disease. We found that not meeting recommendations for the eight foods was responsible for CAD$13.8 billion/year (direct health care: CAD$5.1 billion, indirect: CAD$8.7 billion). Nuts and seeds and whole grains were the top cost contributors rather than vegetables and fruit. Our findings suggest that unhealthy eating constitutes a tremendous economic burden to Canada that is similar in magnitude to the burden of smoking and larger than that of physical inactivity which were estimated using similar approaches. A status quo in promotion of healthy eating will allow this burden to continue. Interventions to reduce the health and economic burden of unhealthy eating in Canada may be more effective if they are broad in focus and include promotion of nuts and seeds and whole grains along with vegetables and fruit rather than have a narrow focus such as primarily on vegetables and fruit.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196333</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163082fd9b1:c0d745:fc1f8953</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jessica R.

When core body temperature increases, appetite and food consumption decline. A higher core body temperature can occur during exercise, during exposure to warm environmental temperatures, or during a fever, yet the mechanisms that link relatively warm temperatures to appetite suppression are unknown. A recent study in &lt;i&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates that neurons in the mouse hypothalamus that express pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), a neural population well known to suppress food intake, also express a temperature-sensitive ion channel, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). Slight increases in body temperature cause a TRPV1-dependent increase in activity in POMC neurons, which suppresses feeding in mice. Taken together, this study suggests a novel mechanism linking body temperature and food-seeking behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1bk6Jjx1vEo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>4</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1633bba0164:e03f8c:abeb7260</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maria A.

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedf:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seon Woo Kim, Julie Haendiges, Eric N.

The ability to simultaneously process and maintain multiple pieces of information is limited. Over the past 50 years, observational methods have provided a large amount of insight regarding the neural mechanisms that underpin the mental capacity that we refer to as “working memory.” More than 20 years ago, a neural coding scheme was proposed for working memory. As a result of technological developments, we can now not only observe but can also influence brain rhythms in humans. Building on these novel developments, we have begun to externally control brain oscillations in order to extend the limits of working memory.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZK-DqGkj6Do&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagement>12</engagement><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162df0f876e:4dc26a:bdf8aaf1</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zsolt Turi, Ivan Alekseichuk, Walter Paulus&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;We aimed to clarify the factors associated with the presentation of erosive esophagitis (EE) symptoms in subjects undergoing health checkups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We utilized baseline data from 7,552 subjects who underwent upper endoscopy for health screening in a prospective, multicenter cohort study. The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing their upper abdominal symptoms and lifestyle. Based on the heartburn and/or acid regurgitation frequency, the EE subjects were stratified into the following three groups: (1) at least one day a week (symptomatic EE [sEE]), (2) less than one day a week (mild symptomatic EE [msEE]), and (3) never (asymptomatic EE [aEE]). Postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) were defined according to the Rome III criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,262 (16.7%) subjects (male 83.8%, mean age 52.6 years) with EE, the proportions of sEE, msEE and aEE were 15.0%, 37.2% and 47.9%, respectively. The sEE group showed significant associations with overlapping EPS (OR: 58.4, 95% CI: 25.2–160.0), overlapping PDS (OR: 9.96, 95% CI: 3.91–26.8), severe hiatal hernia (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.43–4.05), experiencing high levels of stress (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.43–3.40), atrophic gastritis (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.03–2.36) and Los Angeles (LA) grade B or worse (OR: 1.72, 95% CI: 1.12–2.60) in the multivariate analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Approximately one-sixth of EE subjects were symptomatic.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</canonicalUrl><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;
