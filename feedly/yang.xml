Background &lt;p&gt;No evidence-based therapy exists for non-arteritic central retinal artery occlusion (NA-CRAO). Retinal ischemic tolerance is low; irreversible damage occurs within four hours of experimental NA-CRAO. In previous randomized trials evaluating intra-arterial or intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in NA-CRAO, only one patient was treated this early. In December 2013, the Departments of Neurology &amp;amp; Stroke and Ophthalmology at University Hospital Tuebingen, Germany, decided to treat patients using IVT within 4.5 hours of NA-CRAO, the therapeutic window established for ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Consecutive NA-CRAO patients with severe visual loss received IVT after exclusion of intracranial hemorrhage. Follow-up was conducted at day 5 (d5) and day 30 (d30). Visual outcomes were compared to the conservative standard treatment (CST) arm of the EAGLE-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Until August 2016, 20 patients received IVT within 4.5 hours after NA-CRAO with a median onset-to-treatment time of 210 minutes (IQR 120–240). Visual acuity improved from baseline mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.46±0.33 (SD) (light perception) to 1.52±1.09 (Snellen equivalent: 6/200) at d5 (p = 0.002) and 1.60±1.08 (Snellen equivalent: 6/240) at d30. Compared to the EAGLE CST-arm, functional recovery to reading ability occurred more frequently after IVT: 6/20 (30%) versus 1/39 (3%) at d5 (p = 0.005) and at d30 5/20 (25%) versus 2/37 (5%) (p = 0.045). Two patients experienced serious adverse events (one angioedema and one bleeding from an abdominal aortic aneurysm) but recovered without sequelae.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IVT within 4.5 hours after symptom onset may represent an effective treatment of NA-CRAO. Randomized trials are warranted to evaluate efficacy and safety of early IVT in acute NA-CRAO.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198114</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Intravenous thrombolysis in acute central retinal artery occlusion – A prospective interventional case series</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Maximilian Schultheiss, Florian Härtig, Martin S.

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect. In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Binding of sulphonylureas to plasma proteins – A K&amp;lt;sub&gt;ATP&amp;lt;/sub&gt; channel perspective</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Proks, Holger Kramer, Elizabeth Haythorne, Frances M.

Applying machine learning methods to analyze these data holds great promise in facilitating new insights into the genetic and epidemiological associations between anatomical structures and human health. However, the majority of these imaging data are unlabeled and deriving insights is hindered by the cost of manually annotating data at sufficient scale to train state-of-the-art deep learning models. In this work, we develop a weakly supervised deep learning model for Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) classification using up to 4,000 unlabeled cardiac MRI sequences, comprising a total of 120,000 images. Instead of requiring manually labeled training data, weak supervision relies on noisy heuristic functions defined by domain experts to automatically generate large-scale, imperfect training sets. By leveraging new theoretical work on coping with label noise, models can use weaker supervision sources than was previously possible. In our BAV models, this approach substantially outperforms a traditional supervised baseline trained on hand-labeled data alone, with a 64% improvement in mean F1 score (37.8 to 61.4) on held out test data. In a validation experiment using 9,230 individuals with MRIs and long-term outcome data from the UK Biobank, applying the best-performing BAV classification model identified a subset of individuals with a 1.8-fold increase in risk of a major adverse cardiac event (p &amp;lt; 0.001). This work formalizes the first deep learning baseline for aortic valve classification and outlines a general strategy for using weak supervision to analyze large collections of unlabeled medical images.</description><published>1528182000000</published><fingerprint>3a5a867</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/339630v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Recent releases of population-scale biomedical repositories such as the UK Biobank have enabled unprecedented access to prospectively collected medical imaging data.

In this work, we propose methods for (1) automatic feature extraction and classification for VIA and VILI cervigrams and (2) combining features of VIA/VILI cervigrams for improved performance.

The proposed framework achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 81.3%, 78.6%, and 80.0%, respectively when used to distinguish cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN+) relative to normal and benign tissues. This is superior to the average values achieved by expert physicians on the same data set for discriminating normal/benign from CIN+ (sensitivity=77%, specificity=51%, accuracy=63%).

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195565</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Species turnover drives &amp;lt;i&gt;β&amp;lt;/i&gt;-diversity patterns across multiple spatial scales of plant-galling interactions in mountaintop grasslands</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197960</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Student researchers’ perceived prerequisites for voluntary research collaboration in the context of Flemish and Chinese universities</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations. Isolates of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (&lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt;) corresponding to the resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; + QR) and Adriana (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (&lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt;) and Bilbao (&lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt;), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;maculans&lt;/i&gt; populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm1&lt;/i&gt; (10%) and &lt;i&gt;AvrLm4&lt;/i&gt; (41%) were less than that of &lt;i&gt;AvrLm7&lt;/i&gt; (100%), suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Rlm1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rlm4&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt; + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (&lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene &lt;i&gt;Rlm7&lt;/i&gt;. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem canker than NK Grandia (QR). Analysis of the relationship between severity of stem canker and weather data among the 13 sites in the three growing seasons showed that increased severity of stem canker was associated with increased rainfall during the phoma leaf spot development stage and increased temperature during the stem canker development stage. Further analysis of cultivar response to environmental factors showed that cultivars with both an &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR (e.g. DK Cabernet, Adriana and Excel) were less sensitive to a change in environment than cultivars with only &lt;i&gt;Rlm&lt;/i&gt; genes (e.g. Capitol, Bilbao) or only QR (e.g. DK Grandia). These results suggest that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene and QR can provide effective, stable control of phoma stem canker in different environments.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197752</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Combining &amp;lt;i&gt;R&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene and quantitative resistance increases effectiveness of cultivar resistance against &amp;lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&amp;lt;/i&gt; in &amp;lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&amp;lt;/i&gt; in different environments</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yong-Ju Huang, Georgia K.

Using cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (&lt;i&gt;Brassica napus&lt;/i&gt;) cultivars with different &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; genes and/or QR against &lt;i&gt;Leptosphaeria maculans&lt;/i&gt; (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013).

Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyse protein cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chain of a glutamine residue on one protein and the side chain of a lysine residue on another. Generally, TGases show low substrate specificity with respect to their amine substrate, such that a wide variety of primary amines can participate in the modification of specific glutamine residue. Although a number of different TGases have been used to mediate these bioconjugation reactions, the TGase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (bTG) may be particularly suited to this application. It is smaller than most TGases, can be expressed in a soluble active form, and lacks the calcium dependence of its mammalian counterparts. However, little is known regarding this enzyme and its glutamine substrate specificity, limiting the scope of its application. In this work, we designed a FRET-based ligation assay to monitor the bTG-mediated conjugation of the fluorescent proteins Clover and mRuby2. This assay allowed us to screen a library of random heptapeptide glutamine sequences for their reactivity with recombinant bTG in bacterial cells, using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. From this library, several reactive sequences were identified and kinetically characterized, with the most reactive sequence (YAHQAHY) having a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19 ± 3 μM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This sequence was then genetically appended onto a test protein as a reactive ‘Q-tag’ and fluorescently labelled with dansyl-cadaverine, in the first demonstration of protein labelling mediated by bTG.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Design of a glutamine substrate tag enabling protein labelling mediated by &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; transglutaminase</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197073</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Histological validation of calcifications in the human hippocampus as seen on computed tomography</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Melissa E.

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197392</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Genome-wide classification, evolutionary analysis and gene expression patterns of the kinome in &amp;lt;i&gt;Gossypium&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Yan, Guilin Li, Xingqi Guo, Yang Li, Xuecheng Cao&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, can elude hosts’ innate and adaptive immunity as part of the course of infection. The ability of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; to invade or be internalized by host cells in vitro has been proposed as a mechanism for the pathogen to evade immune responses or antimicrobials. We have previously shown that &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; can be internalized by human neuroglial cells. In this study we demonstrate that these cells take up &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; via coiling phagocytosis mediated by the formin, Daam1, a process similarly described for human macrophages. Following coincubation with glial cells, &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was enwrapped by Daam1-enriched coiling pseudopods. Coiling of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; was significantly reduced when neuroglial cells were pretreated with anti-Daam1 antibody indicating the requirement for Daam1 for borrelial phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy showed Daam1 colocalizing to the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface suggesting interaction with borrelial membrane protein(s). Using the yeast 2-hybrid system for identifying protein-protein binding, we found that the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; surface lipoprotein, BBA66, bound the FH2 subunit domain of Daam1. Recombinant proteins were used to validate binding by ELISA, pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Evidence for native Daam1 and BBA66 interaction was suggested by colocalization of the proteins in the course of borrelial capture by the Daam1-enriched pseudopodia. Additionally, we found a striking reduction in coiling for a BBA66-deficient mutant strain compared to BBA66-expressing strains. These results show that coiling phagocytosis is a mechanism for borrelial internalization by neuroglial cells mediated by Daam1.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197413</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Human neuroglial cells internalize &amp;lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&amp;lt;/i&gt; by coiling phagocytosis mediated by Daam1</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shanna K.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the prognosis after early MRI on clinical suspicion of scaphoid fracture, hypothesising that MRI pathology is associated with more disability and that MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures are associated with slower return to work (RTW).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a follow-up study of a cohort of 469 patients, who were scanned in the period 2006 to 2010. The respondents constituted our cohort for disability analysis and the subset that was in the labour market at the time of the trauma constituted our sub-cohort for RTW analysis. Questionnaires included disability scores, job title, and lifestyle factors. Job titles were linked with a job exposure matrix to estimate occupational exposures. Register information was obtained on time until RTW. We used logistic regression analysis of disability and Cox regression analysis of time until RTW.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The proportion that responded was 53% (249/469) for the disability analysis and 59% (125/212) for the RTW analysis. The mean age at follow up was 43.5 years, the mean time since trauma was 4.8 years, 53% had injury of the dominant hand, and 54% had MRI pathology. Men constituted 43% of the cohort and 56% of the sub-cohort. MRI pathology was not associated with more disability [e.g., for a &apos;Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand&apos;-score ≥20 the odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.26–1.17)]. Patients without MRI pathology and with low occupational exposures were off work for an average of four weeks. Patients with MRI pathology or high occupational exposures were off work for twice as long time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MRI pathology was not associated with more disability. For patients, who were in the labour market at the time of the trauma, MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures were associated with slower RTW.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197978</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Disability and return to work after MRI on suspicion of scaphoid fracture: Influence of MRI pathology and occupational mechanical exposures</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lone Kirkeby, Poul Frost, Torben Bæk Hansen, Susanne Wulff Svendsen&lt;/p&gt;

Men constituted 43% of the cohort and 56% of the sub-cohort. MRI pathology was not associated with more disability [e.g., for a &apos;Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand&apos;-score ≥20 the odds ratio was 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.26–1.17)]. Patients without MRI pathology and with low occupational exposures were off work for an average of four weeks. Patients with MRI pathology or high occupational exposures were off work for twice as long time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;MRI pathology was not associated with more disability. For patients, who were in the labour market at the time of the trauma, MRI pathology and high occupational mechanical hand-arm exposures were associated with slower RTW.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1528146000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Lone Kirkeby</name></author><fingerprint>7c9787b8</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197978</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197978</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>14</engagement><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6d:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197511</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rangeline Azevedo da Silva, Leandro de Mattos Pereira, Melise Chaves Silveira, Rodrigo Jardim, Antonio Basilio de Miranda&lt;/p&gt;
Pesticides are one of the most widely used pest and disease control measures in plant crops and their indiscriminate use poses a direct risk to the health of populations and environment around the world. As a result, there is a great need for the development of new, less toxic molecules to be employed against plant pathogens. In this work, we employed an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach to study the genes coding for enzymes of the genomes of three commercially important plants, soybean (&lt;i&gt;Glycine max&lt;/i&gt;), tomato (&lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt;) and corn (&lt;i&gt;Zea mays&lt;/i&gt;), as well as 15 plant pathogens (4 bacteria and 11 fungi), focusing on revealing a set of essential and non-homologous isofunctional enzymes (NISEs) that could be prioritized as drug targets. By combining sequence and structural data, we obtained an initial set of 568 cases of analogy, of which 97 were validated and further refined, revealing a subset of 29 essential enzymatic activities with a total of 119 different structural forms, most belonging to central metabolic routes, including the carbohydrate metabolism, the metabolism of amino acids, among others. Further, another subset of 26 enzymatic activities possess a tertiary structure specific for the pathogen, not present in plants, men and &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;, which may be of importance for the development of specific enzymatic inhibitors against plant diseases that are less harmful to humans and the environment.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197511</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mining of potential drug targets through the identification of essential and analogous enzymes in the genomes of pathogens of &amp;lt;i&gt;Glycine max&amp;lt;/i&gt;, &amp;lt;i&gt;Zea mays&amp;lt;/i&gt; and &amp;lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangeline Azevedo da Silva, Leandro de Mattos Pereira, Melise Chaves Silveira, Rodrigo Jardim, Antonio Basilio de Miranda&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV8) can cause Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) in immunosuppressed individuals. However, little is known about the association between chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), circulating HHV8 DNA levels, and clinical KS in HIV-1-infected individuals with various malignancies. Therefore, we examined the associations between various malignancies, systemic cancer chemotherapy, T cell phenotypes, and circulating HHV8 DNA in 29 HIV-1-infected participants with concomitant KS or other cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We quantified HHV8 plasma viral loads and cell-associated HHV8 DNA and determined the relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and lymphocyte counts, and markers of early and late lymphocyte activation, proliferation and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There were no significant differences in plasma HHV8 DNA levels between baseline and post-chemotherapy time points or with the presence or absence of clinical KS. However, in two participants circulating HHV8 DNA increased following treatment for KS or HSCT for lymphoma,. We observed an approximately 2-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in plasma HHV8 DNA in an individual with KS and multicentric Castleman disease following rituximab monotherapy. Although individuals with clinical KS had lower mean CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts and percentages as expected, there were no significant associations with these factors and plasma HHV8 levels. We identified increased proportions of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells expressing CD69 (P = 0.01 &amp;amp; P = 0.04 respectively), and increased CD57 expression on CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (P = 0.003) in participants with detectable HHV8.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These results suggest there is a complex relationship between circulating HHV8 DNA and tissue-based disease in HIV-1 and HHV8 co-infected individuals with various malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197298</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Human Herpes Virus 8 in HIV-1 infected individuals receiving cancer chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Louise E.

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd). Despite well-documented differences in susceptibility between species, we found no evidence for antibody-mediated immune response and no Bd-related mortality in either species. Additionally, during the study, the sham-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; control group became unexpectedly Bd-positive. We used a custom genotyping assay to demonstrate that the aberrantly-infected &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; carried a Bd genotype distinct from the inoculation genotype. Thus &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; individuals were acquired with low-intensity infections that could not be detected with qPCR. In the Bd-inoculated &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; treatment group, the inoculated genotype appeared to out-compete the cryptic infection. Thus, our results provide insight into Bd coinfection dynamics, a phenomenon that is increasingly relevant as different pathogen strains are moved around the globe. Our experiment highlights how unexpected experimental outcomes can serve as both cautionary tales and opportunities to explore unanswered research questions. We use our results as a case study to highlight common sources of anomalous results for infection experiments. We argue that understanding these factors will aid researchers in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments to understand wildlife disease processes.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196851</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Opening the file drawer: Unexpected insights from a chytrid infection experiment</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Allison Q.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services. In urban residence, mothers professing Islam, those who did not read newspaper at all, and those who lacked health insurance, had greater odds of ANC underuse. In both rural and urban residence, maternal and husband’s education level, region of residence, wealth index, maternal age, frequency of watching television, distance to- and permission to visit health facility were significantly associated with ANC underuse.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural-urban differences exist in the use of ANC services, and to varying degrees, factors associated with underuse of ANC in Nigeria.

Our findings can be applied in 2D layered materials and provide a new strategy to enhance out-of-plane electrical transport properties without degrading thermal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>3D charge and 2D phonon transports leading to high out-of-plane ZT in n-type SnSe crystals</title><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Chang, C., Wu, M., He, D., Pei, Y., Wu, C.-F., Wu, X., Yu, H., Zhu, F., Wang, K., Chen, Y., Huang, L., Li, J.-F., He, J., Zhao, L.-D.</name></author><fingerprint>a40a5817</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/778?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/778?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>9</engagement><crawled>1525975049460</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1634b3364f4:491e3a:abeb7260</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1525986000000</published><fingerprint>dd03e042</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</link><title>Bi-stability in cooperative transport by ants in the presence of obstacles</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

This study aims to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of PCa with bioinformatics. Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</description><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>832b00dd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Biodiversity loss in riparian forests has the potential to alter rates of leaf litter decomposition in stream ecosystems. However, studies have reported the full range of positive, negative and no effects of plant diversity loss on decomposition, and there is currently no explanation for such inconsistent results. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether plant diversity loss affects other ecological processes related to decomposition, such as fine particulate organic matter production or detritivore growth, which precludes a thorough understanding of how detrital stream food webs are impacted by plant diversity loss. We used a microcosm experiment to examine the effects of plant diversity loss on litter decomposition, fine particulate organic matter production, and growth of a dominant leaf-shredding detritivore, using litter mixtures varying in species composition. We hypothesized that plant diversity loss would decrease the rates of all studied processes, but such effects would depend on the leaf traits present in litter mixtures (both their average values and their variability). Our findings partly supported our hypotheses, showing that plant diversity loss had a consistently negative effect on litter decomposition and fine particulate organic matter production (but not on detritivore growth) across litter mixtures, which was mediated by detritivores. Importantly, the magnitude of the diversity effect and the relative importance of different mechanisms underlying this effect (i.e., complementarity vs. selection) varied depending on the species composition of litter mixtures, mainly because of differences in litter nutritional quality and trait variability. Complementarity was prevalent but varied in size, with positive selection effects also occurring in some mixtures. Our results support the notion that loss of riparian plant species is detrimental to key stream ecosystem processes that drive detrital food webs, but that the magnitude of such effects largely depends on the the order of species loss.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198243</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Leaf traits drive plant diversity effects on litter decomposition and FPOM production in streams</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Naiara López-Rojo, Aingeru Martínez, Javier Pérez, Ana Basaguren, Jesús Pozo, Luz Boyero&lt;/p&gt;

Studies in rodents show that olfactory processing in the principal neurons of olfactory bulb (OB) and piriform cortex (PC) is controlled by local inhibitory interneurons, and glutamate NMDA receptor plays a role in this inhibitory control. It is not clear if findings from studies in rodents translate to olfactory processing in nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this study, the effect of the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 on odorant-induced olfactory responses in the OB and PC of anesthetized NHPs (rhesus monkeys) was investigated by cerebral blood volume (CBV) fMRI. Isoamyl-acetate was used as the odor stimulant. For each NHP, sixty fMRI measurements were made during a 4-h period, with each 4-min measurement consisting of a 1-min baseline period, a 1-min odor stimulation period, and a 2-min recovery period. MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) was intravenously delivered 1 hour after starting fMRI. Before MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations were observed only in the OB, not in the PC. After MK801 injection, olfactory fMRI activations in the OB increased, and robust olfactory fMRI activations were observed in the PC. The data indicate that MK801 enhances the olfactory responses in both the OB and PC. The enhancement effects of MK801 are most likely from its blockage of NMDA receptors on local inhibitory interneurons and the attenuation of the inhibition onto principal neurons. This study suggests that the mechanism of local inhibitory control of principal neurons in the OB and PC derived from studies in rodents translates to NHPs.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>fMRI study of the role of glutamate NMDA receptor in the olfactory processing in monkeys</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Fuqiang Zhao, Marie A.

This study suggests that the mechanism of local inhibitory control of principal neurons in the OB and PC derived from studies in rodents translates to NHPs.</content></content><updated>1528232400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Fuqiang Zhao</name></author><fingerprint>d1c8b83f</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198395</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198395</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c2a:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198202</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nga Thi Thu Tran, Christopher Leigh Blizzard, Khue Ngoc Luong, Ngoc Le Van Truong, Bao Quoc Tran, Petr Otahal, Mark Nelson, Costan Magnussen, Seana Gall, Tan Van Bui, Velandai Srikanth, Thuy Bich Au, Son Thai Ha, Hai Ngoc Phung, Mai Hoang Tran, Michele Callisaya&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Waist circumference (WC) is an indicator of intra-abdominal adipose tissue, high levels of which confer an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Population data on WC should be more informative than data on body mass index (BMI), which is a general indicator of body size. This study aimed to evaluate the importance of WC relative to BMI in cross-sectional relationships with blood pressure (BP), glucose, and total cholesterol (TC) in the adult population of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The data were collected in a population-based survey conducted during 2009–10 using the “WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance of risk factors for non-communicable disease” (STEPS) methodology. The survey participants (n = 14 706 aged 25 to 64 years) were selected by multi-stage stratified cluster sampling from eight provinces representative of the eight geographical regions of Vietnam. All measurements were performed in accordance with the STEPS protocols. All analyses were performed using complex survey methods.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The measurements of WC and BMI were highly correlated (men r = 0.80, women r = 0.77). For men, the strongest and predominant associations with BP, glucose, and TC were for WC or an index based on WC. For women, this was true for glucose but BMI was more important for BP and TC. WC or an index based on WC provided better discrimination than BMI of hypertension and elevated glucose, and of raised TC for men. Information on four new anthropometric indices did not improve model fit or subject discrimination.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;For BP/hypertension, glucose/elevated glucose, and TC/raised TC, WC was more informative than BMI for Vietnamese men, but both WC and BMI were important for Vietnamese women.

Typically, such proteomic profiles are interpreted intuitively or by simple correlation analysis. Here, we present a computational method to generate causal explanations for proteomic profiles using prior mechanistic knowledge in the literature, as recorded in cellular pathway maps. To demonstrate its potential, we use this method to analyze the cascading events after EGF stimulation of a cell line, to discover new pathways in platelet activation, to identify influential regulators of oncoproteins in breast cancer, to describe signaling characteristics in predefined subtypes of ovarian and breast cancers, and to highlight which pathway relations are most frequently activated across 32 cancer types. Causal pathway analysis, that combines molecular profiles with prior biological knowledge captured in computational form, may become a powerful discovery tool as the amount and quality of cellular profiling rapidly expands. The method is freely available at http://causalpath.org.</description><published>1526886000000</published><fingerprint>66561d52</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/258855v4?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Measurement of changes in protein levels and in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can be highly informative about the phenotypic consequences of genetic differences or about the dynamics of cellular processes.

Background &lt;p&gt;The use of immediate breast reconstruction and adjuvant radiation therapy is increasing in breast cancer patients. This study aimed to analyze the aesthetic outcome and changes in flap volume in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy of the surgical site after immediate autologous tissue reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Immediate abdominal free flap breast reconstruction following unilateral mastectomy was performed in 42 patients; 21 patients received adjuvant radiation (study group) and 21 patients did not (control group). To compare flap volume, three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) was performed before and after radiation. Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluate shape changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion of radiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in the short- and long-term aesthetic results between the groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When performing immediate autologous breast reconstruction, 14% volume overcorrection is recommended for patients in whom adjuvant radiation therapy is anticipated to improve aesthetic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197615</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Objective assessment of flap volume changes and aesthetic results after adjuvant radiation therapy in patients undergoing immediate autologous breast reconstruction</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yujin Myung, Yousung Son, Tae-hyun Nam, Eunyoung Kang, Eun-Kyu Kim, In Ah Kim, Keun-Yong Eom, Chan Yeong Heo, Jae Hoon Jeong&lt;/p&gt;

First discovered for their role in mediating programmed cell death and inflammatory responses, caspases have now emerged as crucial regulators of other cellular and physiological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In the developing nervous system, for instance, the non-apoptotic functions of caspases have been shown to play critical roles in the formation of neuronal circuits by regulating axon outgrowth, guidance and pruning. How caspase activity is spatially and temporally maintained at sub-lethal levels within cells remains however poorly understood, especially in vivo. Thanks to its transparency and accessibility, the zebrafish offers the unique ability to directly visualize caspase activation in vivo. Yet, detailed information about the caspase family in zebrafish is lacking. Here, we report the identification and characterization of 19 different caspase genes in zebrafish, and show that caspases have diverse expression profiles from cleavage to larval stages, suggesting highly specialized and/or redundant functions during embryonic development.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197966</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization of the caspase family in zebrafish</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Olivia Spead, Tine Verreet, Cory J.

Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197954</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>No-U-turn sampling for fast Bayesian inference in ADMB and TMB: Introducing the adnuts and tmbstan R packages</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Cole C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Social inequalities are widely accepted to have a deleterious effect on children’s mental health, and those with lower socioeconomic status generally experience more mental health issues. In this study, we examine the impact of socioeconomic situations of children’s families during their early childhood on the children’s social adaptation in Japanese elementary school.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The current investigation consisted of two sets of data relating to two separate years (with a one-year interval). The participants included preschoolers aged five years at Time 1 (the first year) and first graders aged six years at Time 2 (the second year); 1,712 met the inclusion criteria for both years. Parents of the participants completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES (i.e., family economy and mother’s education) and their children’s mental health. Mental health was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/4–18, Parent Report.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each SES indicator, we found an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Specifically, bivariate analyses revealed that lower family income, maternal education level, and paternal education level predict all three domains of behavioral problems (i.e., internalized problems, externalized problems, and total behavioral problems). Further, multivariate analyses revealed that lower family income consistently predicts all domains of behavioral problems, lower maternal education level predicted externalized problems and total behavioral problems, and paternal education level did not predict any clinically significant behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In this sample, we found that, for children, family income and parental education when entering preschool were significant predictors of mental health problems after elementary school enrollment; in particular, low income and low maternal educational achievement predicted a high probability of the development of a psychiatric disorder. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of these associations could contribute to improvements in interventions aimed at preventing child maladjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197961</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effect of socioeconomic status on behavioral problems from preschool to early elementary school – A Japanese longitudinal study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rikuya Hosokawa, Toshiki Katsura&lt;/p&gt;

Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a plant trait that involves interactions between nuclear- and mitochondrial genomes. In CMS, the nuclear &lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;), a suppressor of male-sterility inducing mitochondria, is one of the best known genetic factors. Other unidentified genetic factors may exist but have not been well characterized. In sugar beet (&lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.), CMS is used for hybrid seed production, but few male-sterility inducing nuclear genotypes exist. Such genotypes could be introduced from a closely related plant such as leaf beet, but first the fertility restoring genotype of the related plant must be characterized. Here, we report the discovery of a Japanese leaf beet accession ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ that has both male-sterility inducing and fertility restoring genotypes. We crossed the leaf beet accession with a sugar beet CMS line, developed succeeding generations, and examined the segregation of two DNA markers that are linked to two sugar beet &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;s, &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt;. Only the &lt;i&gt;Rf2&lt;/i&gt; marker co-segregated with fertility restoration in every generation, implying that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus in leaf beet is occupied by a non-restoring allele. Fertility restoration was incomplete without a genetic factor closely linked to &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;, leading to the assumption that the &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt; locus encodes a modifier that cannot restore fertility by itself but perhaps strengthens another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;. We sequenced the apparently non-restoring ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; gene-coding region and found that it closely resembles a restoring allele. The protein product demonstrated its potential to suppress CMS in transgenic suspension cells. In contrast, ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; transcript abundance was highly reduced compared to that of the restoring &lt;i&gt;Rf1&lt;/i&gt;. Consistently, changes in protein complexes containing CMS-associated mitochondrial protein in anthers were very minor. Accordingly, we concluded that ‘Fukkoku-ouba’ &lt;i&gt;rf1&lt;/i&gt; is a hypomorph that acts as a non-restoring allele but has the potential to support another &lt;i&gt;Rf&lt;/i&gt;, i.e. it is a modifier candidate.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198409</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A fertility-restoring genotype of beet (&amp;lt;i&gt;Beta vulgaris&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.) is composed of a weak &amp;lt;i&gt;restorer-of-fertility&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene and a modifier gene tightly linked to the &amp;lt;i&gt;Rf1&amp;lt;/i&gt; locus</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takumi Arakawa, Daisuke Uchiyama, Takashi Ohgami, Ryo Ohgami, Tomoki Murata, Yujiro Honma, Hiroyuki Hamada, Yosuke Kuroda, Kazunori Taguchi, Kazuyoshi Kitazaki, Tomohiko Kubo&lt;/p&gt;

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197629</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Purification of complex samples: Implementation of a modular and reconfigurable droplet-based microfluidic platform with cascaded deterministic lateral displacement separation modules</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eloise Pariset, Catherine Pudda, François Boizot, Nicolas Verplanck, Frédéric Revol-Cavalier, Jean Berthier, Aurélie Thuaire, Vincent Agache&lt;/p&gt;

The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Eloise Pariset</name></author><fingerprint>6a629f3e</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197629</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197629</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527757899736</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b57787d8:2ea7740:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26745-2</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26745-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26745-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rc4CoZN9zCA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>664e2260</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26745-2</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26745-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26745-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/rc4CoZN9zCA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Direct phenotypic conversion of human fibroblasts into functional osteoblasts triggered by a blockade of the transforming growth factor-β signal</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26745-2/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26745_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>558</width><height>685</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Kenta Yamamoto</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26745-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/rc4CoZN9zCA/s41598-018-26745-2</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526462812398</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163684610ee:3e8654e:3dd877af</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04284-8</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myosin1D is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of animal left–right asymmetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myosin1D is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of animal left–right asymmetry, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04284-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04284-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Left-right (LR) axis specification is essential for embryonic patterning but a unifying mechanism across organisms has not been identified.

This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children’s health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58–7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07–6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0–8 years old.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197274</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children in Tianjin area, China</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shugang Luo, Yuexia Sun, Jing Hou, Xiangrui Kong, Pan Wang, Qingnan Zhang, Jan Sundell&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Adoptive transfer of dendritic cells expressing CD11c reduces the immunological response associated with experimental colitis in BALB/c mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lisiery N.

In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.</description><published>1527231600000</published><fingerprint>a235e9cc</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/084418v4?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response prediction.

We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.</content></content><title>netDx: Interpretable patient classification using integrated patient similarity networks [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Pai, S.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/25/084418</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/084418v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1528115239157</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163cac418f5:4b7645c:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38781</originId><published>1528070400000</published><fingerprint>aa1de1a4</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item><item>Human Biology and Medicine</item></keywords><title>Correction: HIF-2α is essential for carotid body development and function</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38781</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38781</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38781</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526404381783</crawled><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16364ca7c57:39f3a0f:93d646dc</id><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5193.short?rss=1</originId><description>Coral reefs are increasingly degraded by climate-induced bleaching and storm damage.

Loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in ischemic stroke victims initiates a devastating cascade of events causing brain damage. Maintaining the BBB is important to preserve brain function in ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only effective fibrinolytic treatment at the acute stage of ischemic stroke, also injures the BBB and increases the risk of brain edema and secondary hemorrhagic transformation. Thus, it is important to identify compounds that maintain BBB integrity in the face of ischemic injury in patients with stroke. We previously demonstrated that intravenously injected phosphorylated recombinant heat shock protein 27 (prHSP27) protects the brains of mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), an animal stroke-model. Here, we determined whether prHSP27, in addition to attenuating brain injury, also decreases BBB damage in hyperglycemic tMCAO mice that had received tPA. After induction of hyperglycemia and tMCAO, we examined 4 treatment groups: 1) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2) prHSP27, 3) tPA, 4) tPA plus prHSP27. We examined the effects of prHSP27 by comparing the BSA and prHSP27 groups and the tPA and tPA plus prHSP27 groups. Twenty-four hours after injection, prHSP27 reduced infarct volume, brain swelling, neurological deficits, the loss of microvessel proteins and endothelial cell walls, and mortality. It also reduced the rates of hemorrhagic transformation, extravasation of endogenous IgG, and MMP-9 activity, signs of BBB damage. Therefore, prHSP27 injection attenuated brain damage and preserved the BBB in tPA-injected, hyperglycemic tMCAO experimental stroke-model mice, in which the BBB is even more severely damaged than in simple tMCAO mice. The attenuation of brain damage and BBB disruption in the presence of tPA suggests the effectiveness of prHSP27 and tPA as a combination therapy. prHSP27 may be a novel therapeutic agent for ischemic stroke patients whose BBBs are injured following tPA injections.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198039</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Phosphorylated recombinant HSP27 protects the brain and attenuates blood-brain barrier disruption following stroke in mice receiving intravenous tissue-plasminogen activator</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yoshiaki Shimada, Hideki Shimura, Ryota Tanaka, Kazuo Yamashiro, Masato Koike, Yasuo Uchiyama, Takao Urabe, Nobutaka Hattori&lt;/p&gt;

Recognition of the functional sites of genes is also a fundamental step in gene structure predictions in the most powerful programs.

In this paper, we present a framework that is based on floating search for combining as many classifiers as needed for the recognition of any functional sites of a gene.

The method is also scalable to large datasets, as is shown in experiments in which the whole human genome is used. The method is also applicable to other recognition tasks. We present experiments on the recognition of these four functional sites in the human genome, which is used as the target genome, and use another 20 species as sources of evidence. The proposed methodology shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods for use in a thorough evaluation process.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>ad6cca5f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006186</link><title>Minimal model of interictal and ictal discharges “Epileptor-2”</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anton V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197607</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Prevalence, outcome and quality of care among children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition in Kenyan hospitals: A multi-site observational study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

Synthetic biologists construct innovative genetic/biological systems to treat environmental, energy, and health problems. Many systems employ rewired cells for non-native product synthesis, while a few have employed the rewired cells as ‘smart’ devices with programmable function. Building on the latter, we developed a genetic construct to control and direct bacterial motility towards hydrogen peroxide, one of the body’s immune response signaling molecules. A motivation for this work is the creation of cells that can target and autonomously treat disease, the latter signaled by hydrogen peroxide release. Bacteria naturally move towards a variety of molecular cues (e.g., nutrients) in the process of chemotaxis. In this work, we engineered bacteria to recognize and move towards hydrogen peroxide, a non-native chemoattractant and potential toxin. Our system exploits &lt;i&gt;oxyRS&lt;/i&gt;, the native oxidative stress regulon of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. We first demonstrated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated upregulation motility regulator, CheZ. Using transwell assays, we showed a two-fold increase in net motility towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, using a 2D cell tracking system, we quantified bacterial motility descriptors including velocity, % running (of tumble/run motions), and a dynamic net directionality towards the molecular cue. In CheZ mutants, we found that increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (0–200 μM) and induction time resulted in increased running speeds, ultimately reaching the native &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; wild-type speed of ~22 μm/s with a ~45–65% ratio of running to tumbling. Finally, using a microfluidic device with stable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gradients, we characterized responses and the potential for “programmed” directionality towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in quiescent fluids.

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Functional clustering of mouse ultrasonic vocalization data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Xiaoling Dou</name></author><fingerprint>b9423df6</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e2:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526972400000</published><fingerprint>73e96e44</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26304-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26304_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>612</width><height>685</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Pol Sopeña</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Za9VfSXdeP8/s41598-018-26304-9</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e27:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197934</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xi Chen, Long-Yun Li, Jin-Lan Jiang, Kai Li, Zhen-Bo Su, Fu-Qiang Zhang, Wen-Jing Zhang, Guo-Qing Zhao&lt;/p&gt;
In this study, we investigated the relationship between propofol and autophagy and examined whether this relationship depends on ER stress, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and disruption of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis. To this end, we measured C2C12 cell apoptosis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, along with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels; ROS production; and expression of proteins and genes associated with autophagy, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and ER stress, including LC3 (microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3), p62, AMPK (adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), phosphorylated mTOR, CHOP (C/BEP homologous protein), and Grp78/Bip (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). We found that propofol treatment induced autophagy, ER stress, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. The ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to AMPK increased, whereas the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR to mTOR decreased. Collectively, the data suggested that propofol induced autophagy &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; through ER stress, resulting in elevated ROS and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197432</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Strengthening primary eye care in South Africa: An assessment of services and prospective evaluation of a health systems support package</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rivka R.

In this paper we report an initial validation of the Shape Trail Test–Child Version (STT-CV) with a non-clinical sample of children aged 6 to 9 years. The STT-CV has been developed as an age-appropriate and culturally fair direct downward extension of the Trail Making Test (TMT) for the assessment of cognitive flexibility. Children completed the STT-CV and four established measures of executive functions that assessed working memory, inhibitory control and task switching. Results showed the expected age-based differences in completion times for both parts of the STT-CV (Trail A and Trail B). Children’s performance on the STT-CV correlated significantly with all four measures of executive functions. After controlling for the effects of chronological age, completion times for Trail B remained correlated with most other measures of executive functions. These findings provide emerging evidence for the utility of the STT-CV, and highlight the need for designing and using appropriate variants of the TMT in the behavioural assessment of cognitive flexibility in developmentally and culturally diverse populations.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198254</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Assessing children&apos;s cognitive flexibility with the Shape Trail Test</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Amy Y.

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention combining Life Review Therapy (LRT) and Memory Specificity Training (MST) (LRT-MST) to improve ego-integrity and despair among cancer patients in palliative care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, cancer patients in palliative care were randomized to the intervention group (LRT-MST; n = 55) or waiting-list control group (n = 52). LRT-MST is a 4-session home-based psychological intervention that aims to retrieve specific positive memories, to re-evaluate life events and to reconstruct the story of a patient’s life, including the diagnosis of incurable cancer. Outcome measures were ego-integrity and despair (NEIS), psychological distress, anxiety and depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), and specificity of the autobiographical memory (AMT). NEIS, HADS and EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL were assessed at baseline (T0), 1 month later (post-treatment; T1), and at 1 month follow-up (T2). AMT was assessed at T0 and T1. Linear mixed models (intention to treat) were used to assess group differences in changes over time. Independent samples t-tests were used to assess group differences at T0, T1, and T2, and effect sizes (ES) were calculated at T1 and T2.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The course of ego-integrity (not despair) improved significantly over time (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = .007) in the intervention group compared to the waiting-list control group, with moderate, but insignificant, effect sizes at T1 (ES = .42) and T2 (ES = .48). Compliance rate was 69% and total dropout rate was 28%, both primarily related to disease progression and death.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;LRT-MST seems effective among cancer patients in palliative care to improve the course of ego-integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197277</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The efficacy of Life Review Therapy combined with Memory Specificity Training (LRT-MST) targeting cancer patients in palliative care: A randomized controlled trial</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Gitta Kleijn, Birgit I.

Jasmonates (JAs) are signalling molecules involved in stress responses, development and secondary metabolism biosynthesis, although their roles in fleshy-fruit development and ripening processes are not well known. In strawberry fruit, it has been proposed that JAs could regulate the early development through the activation of the JAs biosynthesis. Moreover, it has been reported that JA treatment increases anthocyanin content in strawberry fruit involving the bioactive jasmonate biosynthesis. Nevertheless, JA signalling pathway, of which main components are the COI1-JAZ co-receptor and the MYC transcription factors (TFs), has not been characterized in strawberry until now. Here we identified and characterized the woodland strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;) JAZ and MYC genes as well as studied their expression during development and ripening stages in commercial strawberry (&lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;) fruit. We described twelve putative JAZ proteins and two MYC TFs, which showed high conservation with respect to their orthologs in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; and in other fleshy-fruit species such as &lt;i&gt;Malus&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Solanum lycopersicum&lt;/i&gt; as revealed by gene synteny and phylogenetic analyses. Noteworthy, their expression levels exhibited a significant decrease from fruit development to ripening stages in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt;, along with others of the JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaNINJA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FaJAM&lt;/i&gt;s, encoding for negative regulators of JA responses. Moreover, we found that main JA signalling-related genes such as &lt;i&gt;FaMYC2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;FaJAZ1&lt;/i&gt; are promptly induced by JA treatment at early times in &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. × &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit.

Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. The methodological approach and analyses used in this study can also be applied to other public health programs to evaluate the coverage and breadth of public health services.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198173</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Mapping pharmacy deserts and determining accessibility to community pharmacy services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Priti Pednekar, Andrew Peterson&lt;/p&gt;

Channel catfish (&lt;i&gt;Ictalurus punctatus&lt;/i&gt;) is a highly adaptive species and has been used as a research model for comparative immunology, physiology, and toxicology among ectothermic vertebrates. It is also economically important for aquaculture. As such, its reference genome was generated and annotated with protein coding genes. However, the repetitive elements in the catfish genome are less well understood. In this study, over 417.8 Megabase (MB) of repetitive elements were identified and characterized in the channel catfish genome. Among them, the DNA/TcMar-Tc1 transposons are the most abundant type, making up ~20% of the total repetitive elements, followed by the microsatellites (14%). The prevalence of repetitive elements, especially the mobile elements, may have provided a driving force for the evolution of the catfish genome. A number of catfish-specific repetitive elements were identified including the previously reported &lt;i&gt;Xba&lt;/i&gt; elements whose divergence rate was relatively low, slower than that in untranslated regions of genes but faster than the protein coding sequences, suggesting its evolutionary restrictions.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197371</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The annotation of repetitive elements in the genome of channel catfish (&amp;lt;i&gt;Ictalurus punctatus&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zihao Yuan, Tao Zhou, Lisui Bao, Shikai Liu, Huitong Shi, Yujia Yang, Dongya Gao, Rex Dunham, Geoff Waldbieser, Zhanjiang Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Primates sample their visual environment actively through saccades and microsaccades (MSs). Saccadic eye movements not only modulate neural spike rates but might also affect temporal correlations (synchrony) among neurons. Neural synchrony plays a role in neural coding and modulates information transfer between cortical areas. The question arises of how eye movements shape neural synchrony within and across cortical areas and how it affects visual processing. Through local field recordings in macaque early visual cortex while monitoring eye position and through neural network simulations, we find 2 distinct synchrony regimes in early visual cortex that are embedded in a 3- to 4-Hz MS-related rhythm during visual fixation. In the period shortly after an MS (“transient period”), synchrony was high within and between cortical areas. In the subsequent period (“sustained period”), overall synchrony dropped and became selective to stimulus properties. Only mutually connected neurons with similar stimulus responses exhibited sustained narrow-band gamma synchrony (25–80 Hz), both within and across cortical areas. Recordings in macaque V1 and V2 matched the model predictions. Furthermore, our modeling provides predictions on how (micro)saccade-modulated gamma synchrony in V1 shapes V2 receptive fields (RFs). We suggest that the rhythmic alternation between synchronization regimes represents a basic repeating sampling strategy of the visual system.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OJjb-Xb_Rf8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>d52fcdd0</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004132</link><title>Microsaccade-rhythmic modulation of neural synchronization and coding within and across cortical areas V1 and V2</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Lowet, Bart Gips, Mark J.

The spindle pole body (SPB) plays a central role in spore plasma membrane formation in addition to its recognized role in microtubule organization. During meiosis, a biomembrane called the forespore membrane (FSM) is newly formed at the SPB. Although several SPB proteins essential for the initiation of FSM formation (meiotic SPB components) have been identified, the molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report the isolation and functional characterization of Dms1 as a component of the SPB. We show that FSM formation does not initiate in &lt;i&gt;dms1Δ&lt;/i&gt; cells. Dms1 protein is constitutively expressed throughout the life cycle and localizes to the SPB and the nuclear envelope. The predicted Dms1 protein has a transmembrane domain, which is required for correct localization at the SPB. Dms1 is essential for the proper localization of three meiotic SPB components, Spo15, Spo2, and Spo13, but these components do not affect localization of Dms1. Collectively, these results suggest that Dms1 anchors these meiotic SPB components to the SPB, thereby facilitating the initiation of FSM formation.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197879</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The fission yeast SPB component Dms1 is required to initiate forespore membrane formation and maintain meiotic SPB components</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Touko Niimi, Taro Nakamura&lt;/p&gt;

Research on familiar faces has recurrently been conducted in different domains, such as, psycholinguistics, memory, attention, face processing, aging studies, etc. In general, photographs of celebrities, their proper names, or their occupations have been the materials mainly employed in those types of studies. These stimuli are, however, very constrained by the geographic and sociocultural contexts in which the studies are conducted, and, in spite of their relevance for psychological research, there are no normative studies for celebrities in Spain. With the aim of filling this gap, the photographs and names of the 118 most frequently produced celebrities in Spain were collected. For each celebrity, values for 13 different indices (including psycholinguistic properties, naming times, and emotional indicators) were obtained from a young adult Spanish sample. Regression analyses on the data indicated that the main determinant in naming times and ToTs was the percentage of correct responses. Face agreement was also a significant predictor of ToTs. Results were compared with previous celebrity norms in other languages, and discussed in relation to the current models of face processing. These norms are likely to make a useful contribution to the design of more controlled research and applied tools in Psychology.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197554</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A normative study for photographs of celebrities in Spain</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandra Marful, Antonio M.

Our work underlines that fork-component recycling and potential origins localization are sufficient spatial ingredients to explain the universality of DNA replication kinetics.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Computational and Systems Biology</item></keywords><title>The eukaryotic bell-shaped temporal rate of DNA replication origin firing emanates from a balance between origin activation and passivation</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>benjamin.audit@ens-lyon.fr (Alain Arneodo)</name></author><fingerprint>549233b8</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35192</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35192</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b8:2835af05</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/972?rss=1</originId><published>1527788426000</published><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/972.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Microbiology</item></keywords><title>Probing the microbial</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Vega, F.

The main purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of a 12-week water aerobics program in a real-life context on health indicators and physical fitness in adults and older adults. Fifteen volunteers (58.80 ± 14.32 years old) were part of an experimental group (Exercise), and eight volunteers (59.00 ± 12.26 years old) were part of the control group (Control). The Exercise performed 45 min of water aerobics twice a week for 12 weeks; no physical exercise was permitted for the Control during the same period. The evaluations were performed the week before (pre-training) and after the training program (post-training). The primary outcomes were the strength and cardiorespiratory fitness variables and the secondary outcomes included body anthropometry, lipid profile and blood pressure. Adjusted analysis for age and baseline values showed no differences between Exercise and Control in post-training moment. However, there was a moderated tendency for increased explosive strength of the upper limbs (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced body fat (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.17), reduced systolic blood pressure (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.14) and triglycerides (η&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19) in Exercise. Within groups changes showed that the training program caused an increase mainly in explosive strength in the upper limbs (0.26 m, 95% CI, 0.03, 0.49; ES = 0.63) In addition, there was a significant decrease in fat mass (-0.89%, 95% CI, -1.74, -0.03; ES = 0.61) and in the systolic blood pressure (-0.83 mmHg, -1.46, -0.19; ES = 0.71). Nonetheless, no significant changes were observed for the lipid profile. These results suggest that 12 weeks of water aerobics performed twice a week in a real-life context seem to benefit the explosive strength, body composition, and blood pressure of adults and older adults but is insufficient to alter cardiorespiratory fitness and lipid profiles.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198319</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of 12 weeks of water-aerobics on health status and physical fitness: An ecological approach</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Henrique Pereira Neiva, Luís Brandão Faíl, Mikel Izquierdo, Mário C.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196922</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Morphology-adaptive total variation for the reconstruction of quantitative susceptibility map from the magnetic resonance imaging phase</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is relatively high in the southern regions of China. Yunnan, located in southwestern China, has the highest number of ethnic groups. However, HEV infection in the ethnic population is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the seropositive rate, risk factor, and clinical impact of HEV infection in the ethnic groups of Yunnan. We recruited 1912 individuals from four minority groups in three prefectures of Yunnan province. Epidemiological records on potential risk factors for exposure to HEV and blood biochemical index were analyzed. All the serum samples were tested for anti-HEV IgM/IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the IgM-positive samples were subjected to nested reverse transcription-PCR to detect HEV RNA. Overall, 1273 individuals (66.58%) were positive for anti-HEV IgG, 16 (0.84%) for anti-HEV IgM, and 64 (3.35%) for anti-HEV IgG and IgM both; none of them had detectable HEV RNA. Multivariate analysis revealed a strong statistical association between ethnic origin and HEV IgG seroprevalence. Anti-HEV IgG reactivity in the Hani ethnic (82.3%; 401/487) population was higher than that in the Naxi (71.9%, 340/473), Bulang (65.1%; 302/464), and Wa (60.2%; 294/488) ethnic populations (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Older age and male sex were independently associated with the risk of past HEV infection. Moreover, anti-HEV IgG-positive individuals showed significantly higher levels of total and direct bilirubin and alanine amino transferase but significantly lower levels of globulin and low-density lipoprotein, than the respective levels in anti-HEV IgG-negative individuals. Thus, the seroprevalence of HEV infection is high in the ethnic populations of Yunnan, China. It is therefore necessary to increase the surveillance of specific risk groups and raise awareness about the possible infectious diseases to help limit the HEV transmission here.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197577</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>High seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus in the ethnic minority populations in Yunnan, China</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yue Feng, Yue-Mei Feng, Songmei Wang, Fang Xu, Xuehui Zhang, Chunyue Zhang, Yuanyuan Jia, Wanru Yang, Xueshan Xia, Jianzhong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma bovis&lt;/i&gt;.

Tass&lt;/p&gt;
Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization.

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered.

Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) that can modulate RNA splicing are used for the treatment of many genetic disorders. To enhance the efficacy of modulating splicing, it is important to optimize SSOs with regard to target sites, GC content, melting temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; value), chemistries, and lengths. Thus, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay systems that allow for the rapid and simple screening of SSOs are essential for optimizing SSO design. In this study, we established a novel tri-chromatic reporter cell line for SSO screening. This reporter cell line is designed to express three different fluorescent proteins (blue, green, and red) and was employed for high content screening (HCS, also known as high content analysis; HCA) for the evaluation of SSO-induced exon skipping by analyzing the expression levels of fluorescent proteins. The blue fluorescent protein is stably expressed throughout the cell and is useful for data normalization using cell numbers. Furthermore, both the green and red fluorescent proteins were used for monitoring the splicing patterns of target genes. Indeed, we demonstrated that this novel reporter cell line involving HCS leads to a more rapid and simple approach for the evaluation of exon skipping than widely used methods, such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and quantitative RT-PCR. Additionally, a brief screening of Locked nucleic acids (LNA)-based SSOs targeting exon 51 in &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; was performed using the reporter cell line. The LNA-based SSO cocktail shows high exon 51 skipping in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the LNA-based SSO cocktails display high exon 51 skipping activities on endogenous &lt;i&gt;DMD&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197373</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Construction of a tri-chromatic reporter cell line for the rapid and simple screening of splice-switching oligonucleotides targeting DMD exon 51 using high content screening</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takenori Shimo, Keisuke Tachibana, Satoshi Obika&lt;/p&gt;

Tuberculosis (TB) in animals is a re-emerging disease with a wide range of hosts that causes large economic losses in livestock. Goats are particularly susceptible to TB and, in endemic areas, vaccination may be a valuable measure to control the disease. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of parenteral vaccination of goats with a heat-inactivated &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/i&gt; (HIMB) vaccine, and compare it to M. &lt;i&gt;bovis&lt;/i&gt; Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine. Twenty-four goat kids were divided in 3 groups as following: HIMB vaccinated group (n = 8), BCG vaccinated group (n = 8) and unvaccinated group (n = 8). Afterwards, goats were experimentally challenged with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium caprae&lt;/i&gt; by the endobronchial route. Antigen specific interferon-γ release assays and serology were performed after vaccination and challenge. Pathological and bacteriological parameters were evaluated after necropsy at 9 weeks post-challenge (p.c.). HIMB vaccine showed similar levels of protection to BCG in terms of volume reduction of thoracic TB lesions, presence of extra-pulmonary lesions, as well as a slight reduction of bacterial load in pulmonary lymph nodes. Moreover, HIMB vaccine did not induce interferences on the interferon-γ release assay based on reagents previously developed to differentiate infected from BCG vaccinated individuals. The results indicate that HIMB is a suitable vaccine candidate for further larger-scale trials under field conditions in goats.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196948</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Efficacy of parenteral vaccination against tuberculosis with heat-inactivated &amp;lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&amp;lt;/i&gt; in experimentally challenged goats</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Arrieta-Villegas, Tania Perálvarez, Enric Vidal, Zoë Puighibet, Xavier Moll, Albert Canturri, Iker A.

Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration.

Jang, Changbong Hyeon&lt;/p&gt;
Binding of odorants to olfactory receptors (ORs) elicits downstream chemical and neural signals, which are further processed to odor perception in the brain. Recently, Mainland and colleagues have measured more than 500 pairs of odorant-OR interaction by a high-throughput screening assay method, opening a new avenue to understanding the principles of human odor coding. Here, using a recently developed minimal model for OR activation kinetics, we characterize the statistics of OR activation by odorants in terms of three empirical parameters: the half-maximum effective concentration EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the efficacy, and the basal activity. While the data size of odorants is still limited, the statistics offer meaningful information on the breadth and optimality of the tuning of human ORs to odorants, and allow us to relate the three parameters with the microscopic rate constants and binding affinities that define the OR activation kinetics. Despite the stochastic nature of the response expected at individual OR-odorant level, we assess that the confluence of signals in a neuron released from the multitude of ORs is effectively free of noise and deterministic with respect to changes in odorant concentration. Thus, setting a threshold to the fraction of activated OR copy number for neural spiking binarizes the electrophysiological signal of olfactory sensory neuron, thereby making an information theoretic approach a viable tool in studying the principles of odor perception.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bABG40KQDFw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526936400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Ji Hyun Bak</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006175</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bABG40KQDFw/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526935325513</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1527282855167</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1639926ecff:6f23b9:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/331561v1?rss=1</originId><description>Realized performance of complex traits is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors, which can be difficult to dissect due to the requirement for multiple replications of many genotypes in diverse environmental conditions.

Global trade and the movement of people accelerate biological invasions by spreading species worldwide. Biosecurity measures seek to allow trade and passenger movements while preventing incursions that could lead to the establishment of unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. However, few data exist to evaluate whether changes in trade volumes, passenger arrivals, and biosecurity measures have altered rates of establishment of nonnative species over time. This is particularly true for pathogens, which pose significant risks to animal and plant health and are consequently a major focus of biosecurity efforts but are difficult to detect. Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>26f2347c</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006025</link><title>Import volumes and biosecurity interventions shape the arrival rate of fungal pathogens</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin A.

Diminishing the cost of broiler chicken diet is a critical issue in the poultry industry. Numerous studies were performed to achieve this pivotal objective by diet supplementation with alternative feed additives. In the current study, low-energy broiler rations were supplemented with different commercial multienzyme formulations to minimize the cost, and increase the digestibility and absorption of the digested macronutrients. Cobb Avian 48 broiler chicks (mixed sex, 1-d-old, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3120) were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was subdivided into four replicates (130 birds per replicate). The birds were randomly allocated into a control group fed basal diet (CB); control group fed low-energy diet (CL); and birds fed low-energy diets supplemented with different enzyme formulations. The enzyme formulations used were Xylam 500&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLX group), Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLH group), Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLA group), and Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (CLM group,) following the doses recommended by the manufacturers. The growth performance of CLA and CLH group birds was significantly improved when compared with CL. In comparison with CB, Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) increased the intestinal &lt;i&gt;PEPT1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GLUT2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-2&lt;/i&gt; expression; PEPT1 facilitates the absorption of micronutrients. In conclusion, exogenous multienzyme complexes may be included in the low-energy diet to enhance the performance of broiler chickens (Avizyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Hemicell&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; ˃ Megazyme&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), and reduce the diet cost by up-regulating the expression of intestinal nutrient transporter genes, and improving the immunity and serum biochemical parameters of broiler chickens.</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198085</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Exogenous dietary enzyme formulations improve growth performance of broiler chickens fed a low-energy diet targeting the intestinal nutrient transporter genes</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ahmed A.

Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><title>A novel Cep120-dependent mechanism inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>mmahjoub@wustl.edu (Ewelina Betleja)</name></author><fingerprint>f81e172c</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35439</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35439</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00031/20180516/images/medium/bi-2018-00031r_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00031&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Microorganisms respond to a variety of metabolic perturbations by repurposing or recruiting pathways to reroute metabolic flux and overcome the perturbation.

Our proposed algorithm uses fewer computational resources than common distributed graph search algorithms, and thus may be useful in other domains, such as for swarm computing or for coordinating molecular robots.</content></content><title>A distributed algorithm to maintain and repair the trail networks of arboreal ants [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Chandrasekhar, A.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/01/194480</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/194480v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1525709458882</crawled><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1633b5ecdc2:29a635c:93d646dc</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With a massive expansion in healthcare coverage, biotech&apos;s next big boom could occur in India.

Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains representative of the most widespread species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of &lt;i&gt;Brucella melitensis&lt;/i&gt; strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS. The results showed that the MALDI-TOF assay could not decipher the true phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the protein profile did not correspond with the genetic evolution of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt;.</description><published>1528232400000</published><unread>True</unread><title>Rapid and safe one-step extraction method for the identification of &amp;lt;i&gt;Brucella&amp;lt;/i&gt; strains at genus and species level by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michela Sali, Flavio De Maio, Michela Tarantino, Giuliano Garofolo, Manuela Tittarelli, Lorena Sacchini, Katiuscia Zilli, Paolo Pasquali, Paola Petrucci, Cinzia Marianelli, Massimiliano Francia, Maurizio Sanguinetti, Rosanna Adone&lt;/p&gt;

The family Streblidae comprises a monophyletic group of Hippoboscoidea, hematophagous dipterans that parasitize bats. &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been reported in bats sampled in Europe, Africa, Asia, North, Central and South America. However, there are few reports on the &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria infecting Hippoboscoidea flies and mites. While Spinturnicidae mites are ectoparasites found only in bats, those belonging to the family Macronyssidae comprise mites that also parasitize other mammal species. This study investigates the occurrence and assesses the phylogenetic positioning of &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; spp. found in Streblidae flies and Spinturnicidae and Macronyssidae mites collected from bats captured in Brazil. From May 2011 to April 2012 and September 2013 to December 2014, 400 Streblidae flies, 100 Macronyssidaes, and 100 Spinturnicidae mites were collected from bats captured in two sites in northeastern Nova Iguaçu, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Forty (19.8%) out of 202 Streblidae flies were positive for &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. in qPCR assays based on the &lt;i&gt;nuoG&lt;/i&gt; gene. Among the flies positive for the bacterium, six (18%) were &lt;i&gt;Paratrichobius longicrus&lt;/i&gt;, seven (29%) &lt;i&gt;Strebla guajiro&lt;/i&gt;, two (40%) &lt;i&gt;Aspidoptera phyllostomatis&lt;/i&gt;, five (11%) &lt;i&gt;Aspidoptera falcata&lt;/i&gt;, one (10%) &lt;i&gt;Trichobius anducei&lt;/i&gt;, one (25%) &lt;i&gt;Megistopoda aranea&lt;/i&gt;, and 18 (32%) &lt;i&gt;Trichobius joblingi&lt;/i&gt;, and collected from bats of the following species: &lt;i&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carollia perspicillata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Artibeus planirostris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sturnira lilium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Artibeus obscurus&lt;/i&gt;.

Only one sample (0.49%) of the species &lt;i&gt;Trichobius joblingi&lt;/i&gt; collected from a specimen of &lt;i&gt;Carollia perspicillata&lt;/i&gt; was positive for &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; sp. in cPCR based on the &lt;i&gt;gltA&lt;/i&gt; gene (401bp).

Conclusions: MXP implements a number of novel features which, from our point of view, make it to be more suitable and more convenient for building bioinformatics pipelines.</content></content><title>MXP: Modular eXpandable framework for building bioinformatics Pipelines [NEW RESULTS]</title><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Kovtun, M.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/329110</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329110v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525796164599</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1634089d3f7:3da8f4:3dd877af</id><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/316562v1?rss=1</originId><description>Motivation: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful method that can provide a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly related to the pathogenesis of a disease.

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence.

WHSC1 is a histone methyltransferase that is responsible for mono- and dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3 and has been implicated as a driver in a variety of hematological and solid tumors. Currently, there is a complete lack of validated chemical matter for this important drug discovery target. Herein we report on the first fully validated WHSC1 inhibitor, PTD2, a norleucine-containing peptide derived from the histone H4 sequence. This peptide exhibits micromolar affinity towards WHSC1 in biochemical and biophysical assays. Furthermore, a crystal structure was solved with the peptide in complex with SAM and the SET domain of WHSC1L1. This inhibitor is an important first step in creating potent, selective WHSC1 tool compounds for the purposes of understanding the complex biology in relation to human disease.</content></content><updated>1525899600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Michael J.

Pomegranate fruit consumption has increased rapidly throughout the world, mainly because of its medical and nutritive attributes. Thus, considerable commercial and scientific interest exists in prolonging its postharvest life with non-chemical applications as much as possible to meet the year-round demand for this fruit. The present work aimed to study the effects of black seed oil (0.1% and 0.5%), propolis (0.01% and 0.1%) and fludioxonil (0.06%), with and without modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on the postharvest quality of pomegranate cv. Wonderful. Treated fruits were stored at 6.5±1 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 150 days. The results indicated that both black seed oil and propolis treatments significantly influenced the maintenance of fruit weight and quality. At 150 days after storage, the fruit weight loss of the samples treated with MAP + 0.5% black seed oil, MAP + 0.1% propolis and MAP alone were found to be 5.5%, 6.3%, and 9.1%, respectively, whereas the weight loss of the untreated control fruits was 19.8%.

Thus, considerable commercial and scientific interest exists in prolonging its postharvest life with non-chemical applications as much as possible to meet the year-round demand for this fruit. The present work aimed to study the effects of black seed oil (0.1% and 0.5%), propolis (0.01% and 0.1%) and fludioxonil (0.06%), with and without modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on the postharvest quality of pomegranate cv. Wonderful. Treated fruits were stored at 6.5±1 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 150 days. The results indicated that both black seed oil and propolis treatments significantly influenced the maintenance of fruit weight and quality. At 150 days after storage, the fruit weight loss of the samples treated with MAP + 0.5% black seed oil, MAP + 0.1% propolis and MAP alone were found to be 5.5%, 6.3%, and 9.1%, respectively, whereas the weight loss of the untreated control fruits was 19.8%. Application of either 0.5% black seed oil or 0.1% propolis, especially when combined with MAP, was also effective in controlling gray mold development and slowing the occurrence of chilling injury.</content></content><updated>1527800400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>İbrahim Kahramanoğlu</name></author><fingerprint>14321823</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb929:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michel Hug, Katrin Uehli, Stig Solbach, Stefanie Brighenti-Zogg, Selina Dürr, Sabrina Maier, Jörg Daniel Leuppi, David Miedinger&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution.

Histocompatibility labs must convert molecular HLA typings to antigen equivalencies for entry into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) UNet system.

Hybrid triploid loaches (&lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;) were generated from natural tetraploid and diploid loaches. We studied the gonads of parents and offspring from direct and reciprocal crosses through histological and transcriptome analyses. The triploid offspring had inferior ability to form sperm and egg cells compared with diploid forms. After sequencing the transcriptomes, 655,109,158 clean reads were obtained, and 62,821 unigenes and 178,962 transcripts were assembled. Of these unigenes, 23,189 were annotated in the GO database, 18,525 in the KEGG database and 24,661 in the KOG database. 36 fertility-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between the direct cross (2n × 4n) progenies and their parents, while 53 fertility-related genes between the reciprocal cross (4n × 2n) progenies and their parents. Following protein-protein interaction network analyses, 54 differentially expressed genes, including &lt;i&gt;PLCB4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyp17a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pla2g4d&lt;/i&gt;, were mined, yielding candidate genes involved in the poor fertility of hybrid triploid loaches. This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Gonadal transcriptome analysis of hybrid triploid loaches (&amp;lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&amp;lt;/i&gt;) and their diploid and tetraploid parents</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by He Zhou, Qi-Zheng Xu, Rui Zhang, Zi-Xin Zhuang, Yin-Qiang Ma, Wei Wang, Tian-Yu Ma, Yi Sui, Yang Liu, Xiaojuan Cao&lt;/p&gt;

One of the most promising approaches to improve recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) is the augmentation of spontaneously occurring plasticity in uninjured neural pathways. Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH, brief exposures to reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels alternating with normal O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels) initiates plasticity in respiratory systems and has been shown to improve recovery in respiratory and non-respiratory spinal systems after SCI in experimental animals and humans. Although the mechanism by which AIH elicits its effects after SCI are not well understood, AIH is known to alter protein expression in spinal neurons in uninjured animals. Here, we examine hypoxia- and plasticity-related protein expression using immunofluorescence in spinal neurons in SCI rats that were treated with AIH combined with motor training, a protocol which has been demonstrated to improve recovery of forelimb function in this lesion model. Specifically, we assessed protein expression in spinal neurons from animals with incomplete cervical SCI which were exposed to AIH treatment + motor training either for 1 or 7 days. AIH treatment consisted of 10 episodes of AIH: (5 min 11% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: 5 min 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 7 days beginning at 4 weeks post-SCI. Both 1 or 7 days of AIH treatment + motor training resulted in significantly increased expression of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) relative to normoxia-treated controls, in neurons both proximal (cervical) and remote (lumbar) to the SCI. All other markers examined were significantly elevated in the 7 day AIH + motor training group only, at both cervical and lumbar levels. These markers included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the BDNF receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). In summary, AIH induces plasticity at the cellular level after SCI by altering the expression of major plasticity- and hypoxia-related proteins at spinal regions proximal and remote to the SCI. These changes occur under the same AIH protocol which resulted in recovery of limb function in this animal model. Thus AIH, which induces plasticity in spinal circuitry, could also be an effective therapy to restore motor function after nervous system injury.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197486</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Acute intermittent hypoxia and rehabilitative training following cervical spinal injury alters neuronal hypoxia- and plasticity-associated protein expression</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Atiq Hassan, Breanna M.

Herbivores can modify the rate of shrub and treeline advance. Both direct and indirect effects of herbivory may simultaneously interact to affect the growth rates of plants at this ecotone. We investigated the effect of snowshoe hare herbivory on the height of white spruce at two treeline locations in Alaska, USA. White spruce is expanding its distribution both upwards in elevation and northward in latitude because of climate warming, and snowshoe hares are already present in areas likely to be colonized by spruce. We hypothesized that herbivory would result in browsed individuals having reduced height, suggesting herbivory is a direct, negative effect on spruce treeline advance. We found an interactive effect between browsing history and spruce age. When young (under 30 years old), individuals that were browsed tended to be taller than unbrowsed individuals. However, older seedlings (over 30 years old) that had been browsed were shorter than unbrowsed individuals of the same age. Hares suppress faster growing individuals that are initially taller by preferentially browsing them as they emerge above the winter snowpack. This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.</description><published>1527886800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198453</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Functional responses of white spruce to snowshoe hare herbivory at the treeline</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Olnes, Knut Kielland, Hélène Genet, Glenn P.

This reduced height, in combination with increased mortality associated with browsing, is predicted to slow the advance of both latitudinal and altitudinal treeline expansions and alter the structure of treeline forests.</content></content><updated>1527886800000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Justin Olnes</name></author><fingerprint>c09e8f8e</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198453</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198453</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1527757899736</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b57787d8:2ea773e:7cfe07d6</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26547-6</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SIRT1&lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;SIRT1&amp;lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26547-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26547-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SIRT1&lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/NM6F7-xlqoo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>f0d809a7</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26547-6</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SIRT1&lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;i&gt;SIRT1&amp;lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26547-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26547-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SIRT1&lt;/i&gt;, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/NM6F7-xlqoo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><engagementRate>0.17</engagementRate><title>SIRT1, miR-132 and miR-212 link human longevity to Alzheimer’s Disease</title><visual><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26547-6/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26547_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><width>622</width><height>685</height></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>A.

Self-measurement and documentation of blood-glucose are critical elements of diabetes management, particularly in regimes including insulin. In this study, we analyze the usability of iBG-STAR, the first blood glucose meter connectable to a smartphone. This technology records glucometer measurements, removing the burden of documentation from diabetic patients. This study assesses the potential for implementation of iBG-STAR in routine care. Twelve long-term diabetic patients (4 males; median age of 66.5 years) were enrolled in the study. N = 4/12 reported diabetic polyneuropathy. Reported subjective mental workload for all tasks related to iBG-STAR was on average lower than 12 points, corresponding to the verbal code ‘nearly no effort needed’. A “Post Study System Usability Questionnaire”, evaluated the glucometer at an average value of 2.06 (SD = 1.02) on a 7-Likert-scale (1 = ‘I fully agree’ to 7 = ‘I completely disagree’) for usability. These results represent a positive user-experience. Patients with polyneuropathy may experience physical difficulties in completing the tasks, thereby affecting usability. Technologically savvy patients (n = 6) with a positive outlook on diabetes assessed the product as a suitable tool for themselves and would recommend to other diabetic patients. The main barrier to regular use was treating physicians’ inability to retrieve digitally recorded data. This barrier was due to a shortcoming in interoperability of mobile devices and medical information systems.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197455</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Seamless recording of glucometer measurements among older experienced diabetic patients – A study of perception and usability</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Rasche, Alexander Mertens, Talya Miron-Shatz, Corinne Berzon, Christopher M.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-α decreased α-SMA (0.74±0.12, p&amp;lt;0.05) and SM22 (0.54±0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Inhibition of autophagy prevented all the TNF-α-induced phenotypic changes. TNF-α induces phenotype switching in A7r5 cell line by a mechanism that required autophagy. Therefore, autophagy may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197210</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Autophagy mediates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced phenotype switching in vascular smooth muscle A7r5 cell line</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marina García-Miguel, Jaime A.

This paper presents the design and fabrication of a multi-layer and multi-chamber microchip system using thiol-ene ‘click chemistry’ aimed for drug transport studies across tissue barrier models. The fabrication process enables rapid prototyping of multi-layer microfluidic chips using different thiol-ene polymer mixtures, where porous Teflon membranes for cell monolayer growth were incorporated by masked sandwiching thiol-ene-based fluid layers. Electrodes for trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were incorporated using low-melting soldering wires in combination with platinum wires, enabling parallel real-time monitoring of barrier integrity for the eight chambers. Additionally, the translucent porous Teflon membrane enabled optical monitoring of cell monolayers. The device was developed and tested with the Caco-2 intestinal model, and compared to the conventional Transwell system. Cell monolayer differentiation was assessed via &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; immunocytochemistry of tight junction and mucus proteins, P-glycoprotein 1 (P-gp) mediated efflux of Rhodamine 123, and brush border aminopeptidase activity. Monolayer tightness and relevance for drug delivery research was evaluated through permeability studies of mannitol, dextran and insulin, alone or in combination with the absorption enhancer tetradecylmaltoside (TDM). The thiol-ene-based microchip material and electrodes were highly compatible with cell growth. In fact, Caco-2 cells cultured in the device displayed differentiation, mucus production, directional transport and aminopeptidase activity within 9–10 days of cell culture, indicating robust barrier formation at a faster rate than in conventional Transwell models. The cell monolayer displayed high TEER and tightness towards hydrophilic compounds, whereas co-administration of an absorption enhancer elicited TEER-decrease and increased permeability similar to the Transwell cultures. The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A multi-chamber microfluidic intestinal barrier model using Caco-2 cells for drug transport studies</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hsih-Yin Tan, Sofie Trier, Ulrik L.

The presented cell barrier microdevice constitutes a relevant tissue barrier model, enabling transport studies of drugs and chemicals under real-time optical and functional monitoring in eight parallel chambers, thereby increasing the throughput compared to previously reported microdevices.</content></content><updated>1525986000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Hsih-Yin Tan</name></author><fingerprint>328caae4</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197101</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7fd:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/673-c?rss=1</originId><published>1525974003000</published><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Molecular Biology</item></keywords><title>Technology Feature | PCR: Thirty-five years and counting</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Dove, A.</name></author><fingerprint>aeea93be</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/673-c?rss=1</href></item></alternate><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/673-c?rss=1</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fcd:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196260</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arianna Pompilio, Valentina Crocetta, Vincenzo Savini, Dezemona Petrelli, Marta Di Nicola, Silvia Bucco, Luigi Amoroso, Mario Bonomini, Giovanni Di Bonaventura&lt;/p&gt;
The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed a higher proportion of two gene clusters (&lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt;) were detected in the APN and RC groups than in CO, whereas &lt;i&gt;iutA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; clusters were detected more frequently in APN strains. The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains. In APN strains, &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt; was associated with higher biofilm biomass formation, whereas &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KpSMT-K1&lt;/i&gt; were associated with a lower amount of biofilm biomass.

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities.

Adult male C57BL/6J mice have previously been reported to have motor and memory deficits after experimental closed head traumatic brain injury (TBI), without associated gross pathologic damage or neuroimaging changes detectable by magnetic resonance imaging or diffusion tensor imaging protocols. The presence of neurologic deficits, however, suggests neural damage or dysfunction in these animals. Accordingly, we undertook a histologic analysis of mice after TBI. Gross pathology and histologic analysis using Nissl stain and NeuN immunohistochemistry demonstrated no obvious tissue damage or neuron loss. However, Luxol Fast Blue stain revealed myelin injury in the optic tract, while Fluoro Jade B and silver degeneration staining revealed evidence of axonal neurodegeneration in the optic tract as well as the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and superior colliculus (detectable at 7 days, but not 24 hours, after injury). Fluoro Jade B staining was not detectable in other white matter tracts, brain regions or in cell somata. In addition, there was increased GFAP staining in these optic tract, lateral geniculate, and superior colliculus 7 days post-injury, and morphologic changes in optic tract microglia that were detectable 24 hours after injury but were more prominent 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, there were no findings of degeneration or gliosis in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which is also heavily innervated by the optic tract. Using micro-computed tomography imaging, we also found that the optic canal appears to decrease in diameter with a dorsal-ventral load on the skull, which suggests that the optic canal may be the site of injury. These results suggest that there is axonal degeneration in the optic tract and a subset of directly innervated areas, with associated neuroinflammation and astrocytosis, which develop within 7 days of injury, and also suggest that this weight drop injury may be a model for studying indirect traumatic optic neuropathy.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197346</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optic tract injury after closed head traumatic brain injury in mice: A model of indirect traumatic optic neuropathy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan K.

FtsZ, the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, has been recently shown to engage in intriguing treadmilling dynamics along the circumference of the division plane. When coreconstituted in vitro with FtsA, one of its natural membrane anchors, on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices compatible with treadmilling of curved polar filaments. Replacing FtsA by a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) to FtsZ, we have discovered conditions for the formation of dynamic rings, showing that the phenomenon is intrinsic to FtsZ. Ring formation is only observed for a narrow range of protein concentrations at the bilayer, which is highly modulated by free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and depends upon guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Interestingly, the direction of rotation can be reversed by switching the mts from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the protein, implying that the filament attachment must have a perpendicular component to both curvature and polarity. Remarkably, this chirality switch concurs with previously shown inward or outward membrane deformations by the respective FtsZ mutants. Our results lead us to suggest an intrinsic helicity of FtsZ filaments with more than one direction of curvature, supporting earlier hypotheses and experimental evidence.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TcroNLOHfIw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><fingerprint>b492f61a</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004845</link><title>Treadmilling analysis reveals new insights into dynamic FtsZ ring architecture</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Diego A.

The signaling pathways that coordinate this complex communication, however, remain poorly understood. The adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also known as ADGRG1) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of OL development in humans, mice, and zebrafish, although its activating ligand for OL lineage cells is unknown. Here, we report that microglia-derived transglutaminase-2 (TG2) signals to ADGRG1 on OL precursor cells (OPCs) in the presence of the ECM protein laminin and that TG2/laminin-dependent activation of ADGRG1 promotes OPC proliferation. Signaling by TG2/laminin to ADGRG1 on OPCs additionally improves remyelination in two murine models of demyelination. These findings identify a novel glia-to-glia signaling pathway that promotes myelin formation and repair, and suggest new strategies to enhance remyelination.</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1527597052432</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abe13210:1e88ffb:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33385</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527552000000</published><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33385</canonicalUrl><description>In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin formation and repair are regulated by oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells, which sense and integrate signals from their environment, including from other glial cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The signaling pathways that coordinate this complex communication, however, remain poorly understood. The adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (also known as ADGRG1) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of OL development in humans, mice, and zebrafish, although its activating ligand for OL lineage cells is unknown. Here, we report that microglia-derived transglutaminase-2 (TG2) signals to ADGRG1 on OL precursor cells (OPCs) in the presence of the ECM protein laminin and that TG2/laminin-dependent activation of ADGRG1 promotes OPC proliferation.

p38 has long been known as a central mediator of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in brown adipocytes, which positively regulate the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). However, the physiological role of p38 in adipose tissues, especially the white adipose tissue (WAT), is largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking p38α in adipose tissues display a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, ablation of p38α causes minimal effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult mice, as evident from undetectable changes in UCP-1 expression, mitochondrial function, body temperature (BT), and energy expenditure. In contrast, genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues not only markedly facilitates the browning in WAT upon cold stress but also prevents diet-induced obesity. Consistently, pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α remarkably enhances the browning of WAT and has metabolic benefits. Furthermore, our data suggest that p38α deficiency promotes white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, inhibition of p38α stimulates the UCP-1 transcription through PKA and its downstream cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which form a positive feedback loop that functions to reinforce the white-to-beige phenotypic switch during cold exposure. Together, our study reveals that inhibition of p38α is able to promote WAT browning and confer metabolic benefits. Our study also indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uSUUK1J4vqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526072400000</published><fingerprint>6d7b2afd</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004225</link><title>Metabolic benefits of inhibition of p38α in white adipose tissue in obesity</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shengjie Zhang, Hongchao Cao, Yan Li, Yanyan Jing, Shengnan Liu, Cheng Ye, Hui Wang, Shuxian Yu, Chengyuan Peng, Lijian Hui, Yu-cheng Wang, Haibing Zhang, Feifan Guo, Qiwei Zhai, Hui Wang, Ruimin Huang, Ling Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wei Liu, Hao Ying&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanistically, inhibition of p38α stimulates the UCP-1 transcription through PKA and its downstream cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which form a positive feedback loop that functions to reinforce the white-to-beige phenotypic switch during cold exposure. Together, our study reveals that inhibition of p38α is able to promote WAT browning and confer metabolic benefits. Our study also indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uSUUK1J4vqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><author><name>Shengjie Zhang</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004225</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/uSUUK1J4vqI/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce958:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><fingerprint>840f21a6</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</link><title>NextGen VOICES: Submit Now: Broad interests: Benefits for science</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/865.2.full</canonicalUrl><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/865-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1527264107827</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527581802701</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163aaf880cd:1d6ee93:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26378-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mw4qgpE5AmA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527577200000</published><fingerprint>616b5d8</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26378-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26378-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/mw4qgpE5AmA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Author Correction: The atopic dermatitis blood signature is characterized by increases in inflammatory and cardiovascular risk proteins</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Patrick M.

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations.

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively.

Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells. An imbalance in the differentiation of these lineages could affect the preservation of bone integrity. Several studies have suggested the importance of this imbalance in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after kidney transplant (KT), but the role of bone marrow adiposity in this process is not well known, and if the treatment with the anti-absorptive (zoledronic acid-ZA) drugs could attenuate bone loss. Thus, our objective was compare bone marrow adiposity, osteoblasts and osteocytes before and after KT, verify an association between bone remodeling process (Turnover, Volume, and Mineralization—TMV classification), the osteocyte sclerostin expression to evaluate if there is a role of Wnt pathway, as well as the effect of ZA on these cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We studied 29 new living-donor KT patients. One group received ZA at the time of KT plus cholecalciferol for twelve months, and the other group received only cholecalciferol. Bone biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. Histomorphometric evaluation was performed in bone and bone marrow adipocytes. Sclerostin (Scl) expression in osteocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Some bone marrow adiposity parameters were increased before KT. After KT, some of them remained increased and they worsened with the use of ZA. In the baseline, lower bone Volume and Turnover, were associated with increased bone marrow adiposity parameters (some of them). After KT, both groups showed the same associations. Osteocyte Scl expression after KT decreased with the use of ZA. We observed also an inverse association between bone adiposity parameters and lower osteocyte sclerostin expression 12 months after KT.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the present study suggests that KT fails to normalize bone marrow adiposity, and it even gets worse with the use of ZA.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><fingerprint>ee3c4299</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</link><title>Tissue-specific activities of the Fat1 cadherin cooperate to control neuromuscular morphogenesis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N) were used to evaluate trophic niche overlap between two filter-feeding fishes (known together as bigheaded carp) native to China, silver carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys molitrix&lt;/i&gt;) and bighead carp (&lt;i&gt;Hypophthalmichthys nobilis&lt;/i&gt;), and three native filter-feeding fish including bigmouth buffalo (&lt;i&gt;Ictiobus cyprinellus&lt;/i&gt;), gizzard shad (&lt;i&gt;Dorosoma cepedianum&lt;/i&gt;) and paddlefish (&lt;i&gt;Polyodon spathula&lt;/i&gt;) in the lower Missouri River, USA, using the Bayesian Stable Isotope in R statistics. Results indicate that except for bigmouth buffalo, all species displayed similar trophic niche size and trophic diversity. Bigmouth buffalo occupied a small trophic niche and had the greatest trophic overlap with silver carp (93.6%) and bighead carp (94.1%) followed by gizzard shad (91.0%). Paddlefish had a trophic niche which relied on some resources different from those used by other species, and therefore had the lowest trophic overlap with bigheaded carp and other two native fish. The trophic overlap by bigheaded carp onto native fish was typically stronger than the reverse effects from native fish. Average niche overlap between silver carp and native species was as high as 71%, greater than niche overlap between bighead carp and native fish (64%). Our findings indicate that bigheaded carps are a potential threat to a diverse and stable native fish community.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197584</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Isotope niche dimension and trophic overlap between bigheaded carps and native filter-feeding fish in the lower Missouri River, USA</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jianzhu Wang, Duane Chapman, Jun Xu, Yang Wang, Binhe Gu&lt;/p&gt;

For the last 100 years, it has been uncontroversial to state that the plant germline is set aside late in development, but there is surprisingly little evidence to support this view. In contrast, much evolutionary theory and several recent empirical studies seem to suggest the opposite—that the germlines of some and perhaps most plants may be set aside early in development. But is this really the case? How much does it matter? How can we reconcile the new evidence with existing knowledge of plant development? And is there a way to reliably establish the timing of germline segregation in both model and nonmodel plants? Answering these questions is vital to understanding one of the most fundamental aspects of plant development and evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0LiCyHbkEf4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><fingerprint>1cb6484f</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005439</link><title>Do plants have a segregated germline?</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Robert Lanfear&lt;/p&gt;

Urban extent data play an important role in urban management and urban studies, such as monitoring the process of urbanization and changes in the spatial configuration of urban areas. Traditional methods of extracting urban-extent information are primarily based on manual investigations and classifications using remote sensing images, and these methods have such problems as large costs in labor and time and low precision. This study proposes an improved, simplified and flexible method for extracting urban extents over multiple scales and the construction of spatiotemporal models using DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) for practical situations. This method eliminates the regional temporal and spatial inconsistency of thresholding NTL in large-scale and multi-temporal scenes. Using this method, we have extracted the urban extents and calculated the corresponding areas on the county, municipal and provincial scales in China from 2000 to 2012. In addition, validation with the data of reference data shows that the overall accuracy (OA), Kappa and F1 Scores were 0.996, 0.793, and 0.782, respectively. We increased the spatial resolution of the urban extent to 500 m (approximately four times finer than the results of previous studies). Based on the urban extent dataset proposed above, we analyzed changes in urban extents over time and observed that urban sprawl has grown in all of the counties of China. We also identified three patterns of urban sprawl: Early Urban Growth, Constant Urban Growth and Recent Urban Growth. In addition, these trends of urban sprawl are consistent with the western, eastern and central cities of China, respectively, in terms of their spatial distribution, socioeconomic characteristics and historical background. Additionally, the urban extents display the spatial configurations of urban areas intuitively. The proposed urban extent dataset is available for download and can provide reference data and support for future studies of urbanization and urban planning.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198189</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A time series of urban extent in China using DSMP/OLS nighttime light data</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yao Yao, Dongsheng Chen, Le Chen, Huan Wang, Qingfeng Guan&lt;/p&gt;

Using this method, we have extracted the urban extents and calculated the corresponding areas on the county, municipal and provincial scales in China from 2000 to 2012. In addition, validation with the data of reference data shows that the overall accuracy (OA), Kappa and F1 Scores were 0.996, 0.793, and 0.782, respectively. We increased the spatial resolution of the urban extent to 500 m (approximately four times finer than the results of previous studies). Based on the urban extent dataset proposed above, we analyzed changes in urban extents over time and observed that urban sprawl has grown in all of the counties of China. We also identified three patterns of urban sprawl: Early Urban Growth, Constant Urban Growth and Recent Urban Growth. In addition, these trends of urban sprawl are consistent with the western, eastern and central cities of China, respectively, in terms of their spatial distribution, socioeconomic characteristics and historical background. Additionally, the urban extents display the spatial configurations of urban areas intuitively. The proposed urban extent dataset is available for download and can provide reference data and support for future studies of urbanization and urban planning.</content></content><updated>1527195600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Yao Yao</name></author><fingerprint>b2a7104b</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198189</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198189</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b8544d:93d646dc</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197820</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197820</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Correction: The genetics of overwintering performance in two-year old common carp and its relation to performance until market size</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526590800000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><fingerprint>250d46fa</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197820</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197820</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d098e:2835af05</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/eaar5780?rss=1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;Time series of single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal dynamic features of cell differentiation pathways.

Widening the genetic basis of leaf rust resistance is a primary objective of the global durum wheat breeding effort at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Breeding programs in North America are following suit, especially after the emergence of new races of &lt;i&gt;Puccinia triticina&lt;/i&gt; such as BBG/BP and BBBQD in Mexico and the United States, respectively. This study was conducted to characterize and map previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat and to develop reliable molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding. Four recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations derived from the resistance sources Amria, Byblos, Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, which were crossed to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for their reaction to the Mexican race BBG/BP of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;triticina&lt;/i&gt;. Genetic analyses of host reactions indicated that leaf rust resistance in these genotypes was based on major seedling resistance genes. Allelism tests among resistant parents supported that Amria and Byblos carried allelic or closely linked genes. The resistance in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 also appeared to be allelic. Bulked segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array identified two genomic regions for leaf rust resistance; one on chromosome 6BS for Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2 and the other on chromosome 7BL for Amria and Byblos. Polymorphic SNPs identified within these regions were converted to kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assays and used to genotype the RIL populations. KASP markers &lt;i&gt;usw215&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;usw218&lt;/i&gt; were the closest to the resistance genes in Geromtel_3 and Tunsyr_2, while &lt;i&gt;usw260&lt;/i&gt; was closely linked to the resistance genes in Amria and Byblos. DNA sequences associated with these SNP markers were anchored to the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence, which identified several candidate resistance genes. The molecular markers reported herein will be useful to effectively pyramid these resistance genes with other previously marked genes into adapted, elite durum wheat genotypes.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197317</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Characterization and mapping of leaf rust resistance in four durum wheat cultivars</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Dhouha Kthiri, Alexander Loladze, P.

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited retinal degenerative disease, is characterized by a progressive loss of rod photoreceptors followed by loss of cone photoreceptors. Previously, when tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), a key extracellular matrix (ECM) regulator that binds to and inhibits activation of Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) was intravitreal injected into eyes of a transgenic rhodopsin rat model of RP, S334ter-line3, we discovered cone outer segments are partially protected. In parallel, we reported that a specific MMP9 and MMP2 inhibitor, SB-3CT, interferes with mechanisms leading to rod photoreceptor cell death in an MMP9 dependent manner. Here, we extend our initial rat studies to examine the potential of TIMP1 as a treatment in retinal degeneration by investigating neuroprotective effects in a classic mouse retinal degeneration model, &lt;i&gt;rd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Pde6b-/-&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt;). The results clearly demonstrate that intravitreal injections of TIMP1 produce extended protection to delay rod photoreceptor cell death. The mean total number of rods in whole-mount retinas was significantly greater in TIMP-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (postnatal (P) 30, P35 (P&amp;lt;0.0001) and P45 (P&amp;lt;0.05) than in saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas. In contrast, SB-3CT did not delay rod cell death, leading us to further investigate alternative pathways that do not involve MMPs. In addition to inducing phosphorylated ERK1/2, TIMP1 significantly reduces BAX activity and delays attenuation of the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Physiological responses using scotopic electroretinograms (ERG) reveal b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated retinas are significantly greater than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). In later degenerative stages of &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas, photopic b-wave amplitudes from TIMP1-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas are significantly larger than from saline-treated &lt;i&gt;rd1&lt;/i&gt; retinas (P&amp;lt;0.05). Our findings demonstrate that TIMP1 delays photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into how TIMP1 works in the mouse animal model of RP.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197322</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 enhances rod survival in the &amp;lt;i&gt;rd1&amp;lt;/i&gt; mouse retina</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hwa Sun Kim, Andrew Vargas, Yun Sung Eom, Justin Li, Kyra L.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates is among the highest in the region. Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread, but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20,000-person cohort study. During the study pilot, 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire, provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants, using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However, biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data. Tobacco use in this study population was found to be higher than previously thought, especially among women. Misclassification of smoking status was more common than expected. Poly-tobacco use was also very common. Additional studies are needed to understand tobacco use behaviors and the extent to which people may be exposed to passive tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt; Implications &lt;p&gt;This study is the first in the region to biochemically verify self-reported smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527714000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198119</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Patterns of tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates Healthy Future (UAEHFS) pilot study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammed Al-Houqani, Andrea Leinberger-Jabari, Abdullah Al Naeemi, Abdullah Al Junaibi, Eiman Al Zaabi, Naima Oumeziane, Marina Kazim, Fatima Al Maskari, Ayesha Al Dhaheri, Leila Abdel Wareth, Wael Al Mahmeed, Habiba Alsafar, Fatme Al Anouti, Abdishakur Abdulle, Claire K.

Additional studies are needed to understand tobacco use behaviors and the extent to which people may be exposed to passive tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt; Implications &lt;p&gt;This study is the first in the region to biochemically verify self-reported smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1527714000000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Mohammed Al-Houqani</name></author><fingerprint>89f160f1</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198119</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198119</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>1</engagement><crawled>1526981344788</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163872e3e14:6d409f8:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03713-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/8KBijYV-4JI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526972400000</published><fingerprint>aea5c7d0</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03713-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/8KBijYV-4JI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><title>Hamiltonian path analysis of viral genomes</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Reidun Twarock</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03713-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/8KBijYV-4JI/s41467-018-03713-y</href></item></alternate></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>5</engagement><crawled>1527876013672</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc81ce68:3981bf4:3dd877af</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198424</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bonaventure Amandi Egbujie, Peter Arthur Delobelle, Naomi Levitt, Thandi Puoane, David Sanders, Brian van Wyk&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Globally the number of people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has risen significantly over the last few decades. Aligned to this is a growing use of community health workers (CHWs) to deliver T2DM self-management support with good clinical outcomes especially in High Income Countries (HIC). Evidence and lessons from these interventions can be useful for Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa that are experiencing a marked increase in T2DM prevalence.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;This study aimed to examine how CHW have been utilized to support T2DM self-management globally, their preparation for and supervision to perform their functions.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;The review was guided by a stepwise approach outlined in the framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and O’Malley. Peer reviewed scientific and grey literature was searched using a string of keywords, selecting English full-text articles published between 2000 and 2015. Articles were selected using inclusion criteria, charted and content analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;1008 studies were identified of which 54 full text articles were selected. Most (53) of the selected studies were in HIC and targeted mostly minority populations in low resource settings. CHWs were mostly deployed to provide education, support, and advocacy. Structured curriculum based education was the most frequently reported service provided by CHWs to support T2DM self-management. Support services included informational, emotional, appraisal and instrumental support. Models of CHW care included facility linked nurse-led CHW coordination, facility-linked CHW led coordination and standalone CHW interventions without facility interaction.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;CHWs play several roles in T2DM self-management, including structured education, ongoing support and health system advocacy.

Spatially explicit modelling allows to estimate population abundance and predict species’ distribution in relation to environmental factors. Abiotic factors are the main determinants of a herbivore´s response to environmental heterogeneity on large spatiotemporal scales. We assessed the influence of elevation, geographic location and distance to the coast on the seasonal abundance and distribution of guanaco (&lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, by means of spatially explicit modelling. The estimated abundance was 23,690 individuals for the non-breeding season and 33,928 individuals for the breeding season. The factors influencing distribution and abundance revealed to be the elevation for the non-breeding season, and the distance to the coast and geographic location for the breeding season. The southwest of the study area presented seasonal abundance variation and the southeast and northeast presented high abundance during both seasons. The elevation would be the driving factor of guanaco distribution, as individuals move to lower areas during the non-breeding season and ascend to high areas during the breeding season. Our results confirm that part of the guanaco population performs seasonal migratory movements and that the main valleys present important wintering habitats for guanacos as well as up-hill zones during summer. This type of study would help to avoid problems of scale mismatch and achieve better results in management actions and is an example of how to assess important seasonal habitats from evaluations of abundance and distribution patterns.</description><published>1526936400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197814</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Spatial abundance models and seasonal distribution for guanaco (&amp;lt;i&gt;Lama guanicoe&amp;lt;/i&gt;) in central Tierra del Fuego, Argentina</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Celina E.

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</description><published>1526590800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197847</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The influence of spatial and temporal discontinuities of forest habitats on the current presence of flightless saproxylic beetles</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Eugénie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, Hervé Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

The largest differences in intraspecific head shape among the &lt;i&gt;Carnivora&lt;/i&gt; order are to be found in dogs. Based on their skull morphotypes, dog breeds are currently classified as dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic and brachycephalic. Due to the fact that some breeds have not been yet defined, this classification is incomplete; moreover, multi-breed studies on the skull morphology of puppies have never been performed. The aim of this work was to verify (i) whether differences in the skull conformation of purebred puppies are already present within the first week of age; (ii) whether radiographic and anatomic measures could be considered interchangeable, and (iii) to possibly classify puppies from non-categorized breeds thanks to their radiographic cranial measurements using neural nets.

The largest differences in intraspecific head shape among the &lt;i&gt;Carnivora&lt;/i&gt; order are to be found in dogs. Based on their skull morphotypes, dog breeds are currently classified as dolichocephalic, mesaticephalic and brachycephalic. Due to the fact that some breeds have not been yet defined, this classification is incomplete; moreover, multi-breed studies on the skull morphology of puppies have never been performed. The aim of this work was to verify (i) whether differences in the skull conformation of purebred puppies are already present within the first week of age; (ii) whether radiographic and anatomic measures could be considered interchangeable, and (iii) to possibly classify puppies from non-categorized breeds thanks to their radiographic cranial measurements using neural nets. One hundred and thirty-seven dead puppies aged 0–7 days were examined considering their anatomic and radiographic measures. All linear measures and anatomic indices significantly differed among brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic puppies. Radiographic indices, with the exception of CI, identified the three skull morphotypes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05, for all comparisons). Radiographic and anatomic measures proved to be non-interchangeable in newborn puppies.

The ability to arrange thoughts and actions in an appropriate serial order (the problem of serial order) is essential to complex behaviors such as language, reasoning and cognitive planning. Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perform poorly in tasks that rely on the successful rearrangement of working memory representations. We hypothesized that serial ordering is impaired in nondemented patients with mild PD. We recruited 49 patients with mild idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr Scale 1–2.5) and 51 matched healthy adults. Nineteen patients had normal global cognition (PD-NC, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA≥26/30) and thirty patients had mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, 21≤MoCA≤25). All participants underwent three working memory assessments: two experimental tests that require reordering random digits following a particular rule (adaptive digit ordering test and digit span backward test) and a control test that requires maintaining but no reordering (digit span forward test). PD-NC and PD-MCI patients performed significantly worse (with lower test scores and larger ordering costs) than healthy controls in both digit ordering and backward tests, although they performed normally in the forward test. The ordering cost increased as a function of age across groups, indicating an aging-related decline in the ability of serial ordering. However, individual patients’ task performances were not correlated with their severity or duration of motor symptoms, or daily exposure to dopaminergic drugs. These results suggested that serial ordering deficits exist in early stages of PD, prior to subtle changes in global cognition and in parallel with motor symptoms.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197489</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Impaired serial ordering in nondemented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinghong Ma, Shaoyang Ma, Haiqiang Zou, Yizhi Zhang, Piu Chan, Zheng Ye&lt;/p&gt;

In pathology, Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of tissue sections is regularly used to diagnose and grade malignant tumors. Typically, IHC stain interpretation is rendered by a trained pathologist using a manual method, which consists of counting each positively- and negatively-stained cell under a microscope. The manual enumeration suffers from poor reproducibility even in the hands of expert pathologists. To facilitate this process, we propose a novel method to create artificial datasets with the known ground truth which allows us to analyze the recall, precision, accuracy, and intra- and inter-observer variability in a systematic manner, enabling us to compare different computer analysis approaches. Our method employs a conditional Generative Adversarial Network that uses a database of Ki67 stained tissues of breast cancer patients to generate synthetic digital slides. Our experiments show that synthetic images are indistinguishable from real images. Six readers (three pathologists and three image analysts) tried to differentiate 15 real from 15 synthetic images and the probability that the average reader would be able to correctly classify an image as synthetic or real more than 50% of the time was only 44.7%.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196846</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Optimized generation of high-resolution phantom images using cGAN: Application to quantification of Ki67 breast cancer images</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Caglar Senaras, Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi, Berkman Sahiner, Michael P.

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Herbivory-responsive calmodulin-like protein CML9 does not guide jasmonate-mediated defenses in &amp;lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1526677200000</published><fingerprint>f0cb675</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006172</link><title>On the role of sparseness in the evolution of modularity in gene regulatory networks</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency. Although the affinity of all mutant clones was improved against the four model substrates, the catalytic efficiency and turnover rate decreased for the substrates containing a hydroxyl substitution.</description><published>1527195600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198127</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Tailoring the specificity of the type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &amp;lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&amp;lt;/i&gt; towards methyl sinapate by rational redesign based on small molecule docking simulations</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Io Antonopoulou, Cameron Hunt, Gabriella Cerullo, Simona Varriale, Alexandra Gerogianni, Vincenza Faraco, Ulrika Rova, Paul Christakopoulos&lt;/p&gt;

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The potential of biochar in improving drainage, aeration and maize yields in heavy clay soils</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</content></content><updated>1526072400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Alfred Obia</name></author><fingerprint>b1ebe2f3</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The adipokine leptin acts on the brain to regulate energy balance but specific functions in many brain areas remain poorly understood.

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197110</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Germination fitness of two temperate epiphytic ferns shifts under increasing temperatures and forest fragmentation</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

Retention in care remains an important issue for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs according to WHO guidelines, formerly called the “Option B+” approach. The objective of this study was to examine how poverty, gender, and health system factors interact to influence women’s participation in PMTCT services. We used qualitative research, literature, and hypothesized variable connections to diagram causes and effects in causal loop models. We found that many factors, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, service design and quality, stigma, disclosure, spouse/partner influence, decision-making autonomy, and knowledge about PMTCT, influence psychosocial health, which in turn affects women’s participation in PMTCT services. Thus, interventions to improve psychosocial health need to address many factors to be successful. We also found that the design of PMTCT services, a modifiable factor, is important because it affects several other factors. We identified 66 feedback loops that may contribute to policy resistance—that is, a policy’s failure to have its intended effect. Our findings point to the need for a multipronged intervention to encourage women’s continued participation in PMTCT services and for longitudinal research to quantify and test our causal loop model.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197239</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Interactions among poverty, gender, and health systems affect women’s participation in services to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child: A causal loop analysis</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Yourkavitch, Kristen Hassmiller Lich, Valerie L.

The transcriptional network and protein regulators that govern T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation have been studied extensively using advanced genomic approaches. For a better understanding of these biological processes, we have moved a step forward, from gene- to protein-level characterization of Th17 cells. Mass spectrometry–based label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics analysis were made of in vitro differentiated murine Th17 and induced regulatory T (iTreg) cells. More than 4,000 proteins, covering almost all subcellular compartments, were detected. Quantitative comparison of the protein expression profiles resulted in the identification of proteins specifically expressed in the Th17 and iTreg cells. Importantly, our combined analysis of proteome and gene expression data revealed protein expression changes that were not associated with changes at the transcriptional level. Our dataset provides a valuable resource, with new insights into the proteomic characteristics of Th17 and iTreg cells, which may prove useful in developing treatment of autoimmune diseases and developing tumor immunotherapy.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3TAHD3yxTS4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1527800400000</published><fingerprint>e52d0514</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004194</link><title>Quantitative proteomic characterization and comparison of T helper 17 and induced regulatory T cells</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Imran Mohammad, Kari Nousiainen, Santosh D.

Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195121</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>LDHA gene is associated with pigeon survivability during racing competitions</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05).

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197441</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The enhancement effect of estradiol on contextual fear conditioning in female mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yui K.

Here we show that these pores bind the abundant cellular polyanion IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10°C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse.

Here we show that these pores bind the abundant cellular polyanion IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10°C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse. Moreover, encapsidated reverse transcription assays reveal that, once stabilised by IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the accumulation of new viral DNA inside the capsid increases &gt; 100-fold. Remarkably, isotopic labelling of inositol in virus producing cells reveals that HIV selectively packages over 300 IP&lt;sub&gt;6 &lt;/sub&gt;molecules per infectious virion.

T cell recognition of peptides presented within self-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecules is essential for long-lived protective immunity. As mice age the number of naïve CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells declines. However, unlike for CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, there are more naïve and memory phenotype CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells that bind foreign pMHCII in old mice (18–22 months) than adults (12–15 weeks), suggesting increased promiscuity of pMHCII recognition with aging. Here we asked if CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses to immunization or infection increase with aging since the magnitude of a CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response to a foreign pMHCII is proportional to the size of the precursor population in adult mice. We observed no difference in the number of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in adult versus old mice for pooled secondary lymphoid organs after immunization, bacterial infection, or viral infection, but we did observe diminished numbers of pMHCII-specific CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in both the draining lymph node and brain of old mice after West Nile virus infection. These data indicate that an increased precursor frequency does not translate into more robust responses upon immunization or infection in old mice.</description><published>1528146000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198354</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>A disconnect between precursor frequency, expansion potential, and site-specific CD4&amp;lt;sup&gt;+&amp;lt;/sup&gt; T cell responses in aged mice</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Neha R.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Treatment failures in advanced lung cancer are frequent events affecting patients during or after first-line chemotherapy. International guidelines recommend second-line chemotherapy. However, around one half of patients who experience disease progression enter a systemic second-line therapy. In the herein qualitative study, we investigated patients&apos; thoughts and attitudes determining the decision to undergo a second-line chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Thirty-three purposively selected patients who recently accepted second-line or palliative chemotherapy were invited to participate in this survey consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Grounded theory was applied to investigate participants’ perceptions of the context that have surrounded their decision to undergo palliative chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For most patients, tumor burden and reduced quality of life in relation with lung cancer itself were major drivers of the decision-making process. There was a balance between two different attitudes: making a decision to undergo a new line of chemotherapy or starting a psychological process in order to accept end of life. Choosing between these two attitudes allowed the patient to keep the matter of palliative care at a distance. Even in case of low chance of success, many patients who worried about their life partner&apos;s future would accept a new chemotherapy line. Some patients experienced ambivalent thoughts regarding social network, particularly about their family as daily function impairment required an increased need for relative&apos;s support. The initial &amp;quot;Worrying about others&amp;quot; thoughts left place to in an increasing self-need of care as those provided by relatives; this phenomenon might increase patients&apos; self- perception of being a burden for others. Confidence previously established with formal caregiver support was another major decision driver: some patients with sustained confidence in their medical staff may have privileged this formal support rather than family support when the latter was perceived as weak, insufficient or intrusive.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study identified three domains involved into a complex interplay for lung cancer patients’ decision regarding second-line palliative chemotherapy: (i) perception of the definitive loss of health, (ii) interactions between idiosyncrasy (hope, disease burden) and environment (healthcare and social network support), and (iii) patient&apos;s subjective evaluation of chemotherapy benefit–risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197605</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Qualitative study of patients’ decision-making when accepting second-line treatment after failure of first-line chemotherapy</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-Louis Pujol, Benoît Roch, Caroline Roth, Jean-Pierre Mérel&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Resistance to pentamidine is mediated by AdeAB, regulated by AdeRS, and influenced by growth conditions in &amp;lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&amp;lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felise G.

Cases were patients with a first episode of HO-HCFA CDI. Controls were patients with any other diagnosis; they were randomly selected from the hospital discharge database and matched in a 1:2 manner according to the date of diagnosis of case ± 10 days. Variables with p&amp;lt;0.1 were considered for multivariable analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One hundred and fifty-five cases and 310 controls were included. Variables independently associated with HO-HCFA CDI were: exposure to both ciprofloxacin and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) within the last 3 months (OR = 8.07, 95% CI = 1.70–38.16), febrile neutropenia (OR = 4.61, 95% CI = 1.37–15.46), intraabdominal infection (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.95–4.46), referral from other hospitals (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 0.98–4.05) and an increasing number of antibiotics previously used (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13–1.46).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Multiple factors were found to be associated with the first episode of HO-HCFA CDI in the setting of an outbreak; of the modifiable risk factors, prior exposure to both ciprofloxacin and PPI was the most important.

This paper presents a robust 3D point cloud registration algorithm based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion (MCC). Comparing with traditional registration algorithm based on the mean square error (MSE), using the MCC is superior in dealing with complex registration problem with non-Gaussian noise and large outliers. Since the MCC is considered as a probability measure which weights the corresponding points for registration, the noisy points are penalized. Moreover, we propose to use bidirectional measures which can maximum the overlapping parts and avoid the registration result being trapped into a local minimum. Both of these strategies can better apply the information theory method to the point cloud registration problem, making the algorithm more robust. In the process of implementation, we integrate the fixed-point optimization technique based on the iterative closest point algorithm, resulting in the correspondence and transformation parameters that are solved iteratively. The comparison experiments under noisy conditions with related algorithms have demonstrated good performance of the proposed algorithm.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197542</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Robust 3D point cloud registration based on bidirectional Maximum Correntropy Criterion</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xuetao Zhang, Libo Jian, Meifeng Xu&lt;/p&gt;

For nearly a century, conventional microbiological methods have been standard practice for detecting and identifying pathogens in food. Nevertheless, the microbiological safety of food has improved and various rapid methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods. Alternative methods are expected to detect low cell numbers, since the presence in food of even a single cell of a pathogenic organism may be infectious. With respect to low population levels, the performance of a detection method is assessed by producing serial dilutions of a pure bacterial suspension to inoculate representative food matrices with highly diluted bacterial cells (fewer than 10 CFU/ml). The accuracy of data obtained by multiple dilution techniques is not certain and does not exclude some colonies arising from clumps of cells. Micromanipulation techniques to capture and isolate single cells from environmental samples were introduced more than 40 years ago. The main limitation of the current micromanipulation technique is still the low recovery rate for the growth of a single cell in culture medium. In this study, we describe a new single cell isolation method and demonstrate that it can be used successfully to grow various types of microorganism from picked individual cells. Tests with Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including cocci, rods, aerobes, anaerobes, yeasts and molds showed growth recovery rates from 60% to 100% after micromanipulation. We also highlight the use of our method to evaluate and challenge the detection limits of standard detection methods in food samples contaminated by a single cell of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;.</description><published>1527800400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198208</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Development of a micromanipulation method for single cell isolation of prokaryotes and its application in food safety</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marisa Hohnadel, Myriam Maumy, Renaud Chollet&lt;/p&gt;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Development of an efficient chromatin immunoprecipitation method to investigate protein-DNA interaction in oleaginous castor bean seeds</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

While the pattern of cell division has specific rules for healthy development, some fluctuations for this pattern are allowable. In order to uncover this robust mechanism of development, the position of cells in each embryo must be analyzed quantitatively. In the embryonic developmental biology, various studies are attempted to acquire the quantitative criteria from time-series three-dimensional microscopic images by image analysis such as segmentation, to understand the mechanism of development. Unfortunately, due to the fact of inaccuracy of nuclei detection and segmentation, it is a hard task to evaluate an embryo quantitatively from bioimages automatically. Based on these demands of quantitative analysis, we developed QCA Net, which accurately performs nuclear segmentation of three-dimensional fluorescence microscopic images for early-stage mouse embryos. QCA Net is based on Convolutional Neural Network. We trained QCA Net using a part of one early-stage mouse embryo. As a test, QCA Net performed segmentation of different 11 mouse embryos images. We succeeded in accurately acquiring the shape of the nucleus without fusion of nuclear regions. Besides, we achieved accurate extraction of the time-series data of nuclear number, volume, surface area, and center of gravity coordinates as the quantitative criteria of mouse development, from the segmentation images acquired by QCA Net. To our surprise, these results suggested that QCA Net recognized and distinguished the nucleus and a polar body formed in meiosis process. We consider that QCA Net can drastically contribute to performing segmentation of various bioimages in the embryonic developmental biology. The various quantitative criteria obtained from segmented images can uncover various unknown mechanisms of embryonic development, such as the robust mechanism of development.</description><published>1526540400000</published><fingerprint>e722e9b3</fingerprint><unread>True</unread><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/324186v1?rss=1</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Multicellular organisms develop from the fertilized eggs through numbers of cell divisions.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is generally considered as a mild exanthematous disease to infants and young children worldwide. HFMD cases are usually mild and self-limiting but for few cases leads to complicated severe clinical outcomes, and even death. Previous studies have indicated that serum Ang II levels in patients with H7N9 infection were related to the severity of infection. However, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of severe HFMD remain unclear. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the progression of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In the present study, 162 children including HFMD patients and healthy controls were recruited. The data was analyzed by time-series fashion. Concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II) and noradrenaline (NA) in serum of patients were measured with ELISA. We established a mouse model for enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and determined concentrations of Ang II, NA in tissue lysates at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (dpi).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of the HFMD patients with mild or severe symptoms were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in serum of severe cases were significantly higher than those mild cases and the increased concentrations of Ang II and NA showed the same time trend during the progression of HFMD in the severe cases. Furthermore, the concentrations of Ang II and NA in target organs of EV71-infected mice including brains, skeletal muscle, and lungs were increased with the progression of EV71 infection in mice. Histopathological alterations were observed in the brains, skeletal muscle and lungs of EV71-infected mice.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our study suggested that activation of the RAS is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197861</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the progression of severe hand-foot-and-mouth disease</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Zhang, Shuaiyin Chen, Guangyuan Zhou, Yuefei Jin, Rongguang Zhang, Haiyan Yang, Yuanlin Xi, Jingchao Ren, Guangcai Duan&lt;/p&gt;

Although numerous studies have investigated the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) separately each other, it is unclear whether an association between neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity is present. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional changes in hippocampus before and after treatment with escitalopram and to associate these changes with peptides related to neuronal growth in patients with chronic PTSD and trauma survivors without PTSD. Fifteen earthquake survivors with chronic PTSD and thirteen drug naïve trauma exposed individuals without PTSD underwent fMRI scans in a block design. Serum levels of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were measured before and after 12 weeks treatment with escitalopram. Baseline median serum level of NGF was significantly lower in patients with chronic PTSD than trauma survivors; however, 12 weeks of treatment with escitalopram significantly increased it. Higher activation was found both in left and right hippocampus for chronic PTSD group than trauma survivors. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with suppression of the hyperactivation in left hippocampus in patients with chronic PTSD. Bilateral hyperactivation in hippocampus and lowered NGF may associate with neurobiological disarrangements in chronic PTSD. Treatment with escitalopram was significantly associated with both improvement in the severity of PTSD symptoms and biological alterations. Patients diagnosed with PTSD may have further and complicated deteriorations in hippocampal networks and neurotransmitter systems than individuals who had not been diagnosed with PTSD following the same traumatic experience.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197889</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Neurotrophic factors and hippocampal activity in PTSD</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ümit Tural, Ahmet Tamer Aker, Emin Önder, Hatice Turan Sodan, Hatice Ünver, Gür Akansel&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Up to 25% of acute stroke patients first note symptoms upon awakening. We hypothesized that patients awaking with stroke symptoms may be safely treated with intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) using non-contrast head CT (NCHCT), if they meet all other standard criteria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The SAfety of Intravenous thromboLytics in stroke ON awakening (SAIL ON) was a prospective, open-label, single treatment arm, pilot safety trial of standard dose IV tPA in patients who presented with stroke symptoms within 0–4.5 hours of awakening. From January 30, 2013, to September 1, 2015, twenty consecutive wakeup stroke patients selected by NCHCT were enrolled. The primary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in the first 36 hours. Secondary outcomes included NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at 24 hours; and modified Rankin Score (mRS), NIHSS, and Barthel index at 90 days.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The average age was 65 years (range 47–83); 40% were women; 50% were African American. The average NIHSS was 6 (range 4–11). The average time from wake-up to IV tPA was 205 minutes (range 114–270). The average time from last known well to IV tPA was 580 minutes (range 353–876). The median mRS at 90 days was 1 (range 0–5). No patients had sICH; two of 20 (10%) had asymptomatic ICH on routine post IV tPA brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Administration of IV tPA was feasible and may be safe in wakeup stroke patients presenting within 4.5 hours from awakening, screened with NCHCT.

To examine the origin of seizures induced by severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, The EEG characteristics of seizures were analyzed in newborns with and without severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine the specificity. In total, 931 patients had a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level of 340–425 μmol/L, only 2 of whom had seizures. Compared to patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a TSB level of 340–425 μmol/L, those with a TSB level &gt;425 μmol/L had a significant risk of seizure (OR = 213.2, 95% CI = 113.0–405.8, P&amp;lt;0.001). Of all 28 patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia and seizure, 26 had seizures that originated in the temporal and/or occipital lobe. In seizure patients without severe hyperbilirubinemia, origination in the temporal/occipital and other lobes occurred in 19 and 117 cases, respectively. Compared to the risk of seizure origination in the temporal and/or occipital lobe in other diseases, the risk in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia was increased by approximately 80 times (OR = 80.1, 95% CI = 28.3–226.4, P&amp;lt;0.001). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia can selectively induce temporal and occipital lobe seizures. This is the first report of a new syndrome with the same etiology and electrophysiological features as epilepsy.</description><published>1526072400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197113</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia induces temporal and occipital lobe seizures</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Lian Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Integrin α8 (ITGA8) heterodimerizes with integrin β1 and is highly expressed in stromal cells of the lung. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ+) cells constitute a major population of contractile myofibroblasts in the lung following bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Integrin α8β1 is upregulated in fibrotic foci in bleomycin-induced lung injury. However, the functional role of ITGA8 in fibrogenesis has not been characterized. In this study, we examined whether genetic deletion of ITGA8 from PDGFRβ+ cells in the lung altered fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/-&lt;/sup&gt; or Pdgfrb-Cre/+;&lt;i&gt;Itga8&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; (Cre+) and control mice (Cre-) were used for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.

We previously identified brown adipose tissue (BAT) as a source of sleep-inducing signals. Pharmacological activation of BAT enhances sleep while sleep loss leads to increased BAT thermogenesis. Recovery sleep after sleep loss is diminished in mice that lack uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), and also in wild-type (WT) mice after sensory denervation of the BAT. Systemic inflammation greatly affects metabolism and the function of adipose tissue, and also induces characteristic sleep responses. We hypothesized that sleep responses to acute inflammation are mediated by BAT-derived signals. To test this, we determined the effects of systemic inflammation on sleep and body temperature in UCP-1 knockout (KO) and WT mice. Intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 beta and clodronate containing liposomes were used to induce systemic inflammation. In WT animals, non-rapid-eye movement sleep (NREMS) was elevated in all four inflammatory models. All NREMS responses were completely abolished in UCP-1 KO animals. Systemic inflammation elicited an initial hypothermia followed by fever in WT mice. The hypothermic phase, but not the fever, was abolished in UCP-1 KO mice. The only recognized function of UCP-1 is to promote thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Present results indicate that the presence of UCP-1 is necessary for increased NREMS but does not contribute to the development of fever in systemic inflammation.</description><published>1525986000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197409</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Brown adipose tissue plays a central role in systemic inflammation-induced sleep responses</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Éva Szentirmai, Levente Kapás&lt;/p&gt;

Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the human cornea is crucial for understanding the development of corneal diseases and impact of surgical treatments (e.g., corneal laser surgery, corneal cross-linking). Using a Surface Force Apparatus we investigated the transient viscous response of the anterior cornea from donor human eyes compressed between macroscopic crossed cylinders. Corneal biomechanics was analyzed using linear viscoelastic theory and interpreted in the framework of a biphasic model of soft hydrated porous tissues, including a significant contribution from the pressurization and viscous flow of fluid within the corneal tissue. Time-resolved measurements of tissue deformation and careful determination of the relaxation time provided an elastic modulus in the range between 0.17 and 1.43 MPa, and fluid permeability of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/(N∙s). The permeability decreased as the deformation was increased above a strain level of about 10%, indicating that the interstitial space between fibrils of the corneal stromal matrix was reduced under the effect of strong compression. This effect may play a major role in determining the observed rate-dependent non-linear stress-strain response of the anterior cornea, which underlies the shape and optical properties of the tissue.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197779</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Transient viscous response of the human cornea probed with the Surface Force Apparatus</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bruno Zappone, Navinkumar J.

= 0.26 kcal/mol) associated with electron transfer in Be2B36Li21 and Be2B36 species confirm that boron rich species have potential abilities to be used in the Li‐based battery. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><published>1525340855000</published><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25234?af=R</link><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><title>Electronic and structural properties of Lin@Be2B8 (n = 1–14) and Lin@Be2B36 (n = 1–21) nanoflakes shed light on possible anode materials for Li‐based batteries</title><visual><url>none</url></visual><origin><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId></origin><author><name>MoeinGoodarzi

The Hedgehog family of morphogens has long been known to utilize, through the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), the heterotrimeric G protein G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in both canonical and noncanonical forms of signaling. Other G proteins, while not specifically utilized by Smo, may nonetheless provide access to some of the events controlled by it. We reported several years ago that the G protein G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; activates one or more forms of the Gli family of transcription factors. While the Gli transcription factors are well known targets for Smo, the uncertain mechanism of activation by G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and the identity of the targeted Gli(s) limited predictions as to the extent to which G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; might mimic Smo’s actions. We evaluate here the potential for overlap in G&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and Smo signaling using C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 cells as models of osteogenesis and adipogenesis, respectively. We find in C3H10T1/2 cells that a constitutively active form of Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL) increases Gli1 mRNA, as does a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoA1). We find as well that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL induces alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker of osteogenesis, albeit the induction is far less substantial than that achieved by SmoA1. In 3T3-L1 cells both Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 markedly suppress adipogenic differentiation as determined by triglyceride accumulation. RNA sequencing reveals that Gα&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;QL and SmoA1 regulate many of the same genes but that quantitative and qualitative differences exist. Differences also exist, we find, between SmoA1 and purmorphamine, an agonist for Smo. Therefore, while comparisons of constitutively active proteins are informative, extrapolations to the setting of agonists require care.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197442</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Overlap in signaling between Smoothened and the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G&amp;lt;sub&gt;13&amp;lt;/sub&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Xueshui Guo, Natalia A.

It is common in practicing orthognathic surgery to evaluate faces with retruded or protruded chins (dysgnathic faces) using photographs. Because motion may alter how the face is perceived, we investigated the perception of faces presented via photographs and videos. Two hundred naïve raters (lay persons, without maxillo facial surgery background) evaluated 12 subjects with varying chin anatomy [so-called skeletal Class I (normal chin), Class II (retruded chin), and Class III (protruded chin)]. Starting from eight traits, with Factor analysis we found a two-Factor solution, i.e. an &amp;quot;aesthetics associated traits cluster&amp;quot; and a Factor &amp;quot;personality traits cluster&amp;quot; which appeared to be uncorrelated. Internal consistency of the Factors found for photographs and videos was excellent. Generally, female raters delivered better ratings than males, but the effect sizes were small. We analyzed differences and the respective effect magnitude between photograph and video perception. For each skeletal class the aesthetics associated dimensions were rated similarly between photographs and video clips. In contrast, specific personality traits were rated differently. Differences in the class-specific personality traits seen on photographs were &amp;quot;smoothed&amp;quot; in the assessment of videos, which implies that photos enhance stereotypes commonly attributed to a retruded or protruded chin.</description><published>1526677200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196856</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Perception of aesthetics and personality traits in orthognathic surgery patients: A comparison of still and moving images</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Klaus Sinko, Ulrich S.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</description><published>1525899600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Visual perceptual training reconfigures post-task resting-state functional connectivity with a feature-representation region</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

Whether this activity influences prosocial behavior remains debated. Here participants witnessed a confederate express pain via a reaction of the swatted hand or via a facial expression and could decide to reduce that pain by donating money. Participants donate more money on trials in which the confederate expressed more pain. EEG shows that activity of the SI hand region explains variance in donation; TMS shows that altering this activity interferes with the pain-donation coupling only when pain is expressed by the hand and HD-tDCS that altering SI activity also interferes with pain perception.

Here participants witnessed a confederate express pain via a reaction of the swatted hand or via a facial expression and could decide to reduce that pain by donating money. Participants donate more money on trials in which the confederate expressed more pain. EEG shows that activity of the SI hand region explains variance in donation; TMS shows that altering this activity interferes with the pain-donation coupling only when pain is expressed by the hand and HD-tDCS that altering SI activity also interferes with pain perception. These experiments show vicarious somatosensory activations contribute to prosocial decision-making and suggest they do so by helping transform observed reactions of affected body-parts into accurate perceptions of pain that are necessary for decision making.</description><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><title>The causal role of the somatosensory cortex in prosocial behaviour</title><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>v.gazzola@nin.knaw.nl (Alessio Avenanti)</name></author><fingerprint>4bfa8fa5</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32740</href></item></alternate><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32740</link></item><item><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00385/20180525/images/medium/bi-2018-00385t_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00385&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cities around the world are inundated by cars and suffer traffic congestion that results in excess delays, reduced safety and environmental pollution. The interplay between road infrastructure and travel choices defines the level and the spatio-temporal extent of congestion. Given the existing infrastructure, understanding how the route choice decisions are made and how travellers interact with each other is a crucial first step in mitigating traffic congestion. This is a problem with fundamental importance, as it has implications for other limited supply systems where agents compete for resources and reach an equilibrium. Here, we observe the route choice decisions and the traffic conditions through an extensive data set of GPS trajectories. We compare the actual paths followed by travellers to those implied by equilibrium conditions (i) at a microscopic scale, where we focus on individual path similarities, and (ii) at a macroscopic scale, where we perform network-level comparison of the traffic loads. We present that non-cooperative or selfish equilibrium replicates the actual traffic (to a certain extent) at the macroscopic scale, while the majority of individual decisions cannot be reproduced by neither selfish nor cooperative equilibrium models.</description><published>1525726800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196997</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Searching for empirical evidence on traffic equilibrium</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Mehmet Yildirimoglu, Osman Kahraman&lt;/p&gt;

Medi-Cal pricing data was from the Workman’s Compensation Insurance System (WCIS). Average Wholesale Prices (AWP), Wholesale Acquisition Costs (WAC), Direct Prices (DP), Federal Upper Limit (FUL) prices, and National Average Drug Acquisition Costs (NADAC) were from Medi-Span. We matched National Drug Codes (NDCs), pricing dates, and drug quantity for comparisons. We report pharmacy-dispensed (PD) claims frequency, reimbursement matching rate, and paid costs by CAWCS as the reference price against all alternative price benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 12,529,977 CAWCS claims for pharmaceutical products 11.6% (1,462,814) were for PD drugs. Prescription drug cost for CAWCS was over $152M; $63.9M, $47.9M, and $40.6M in 2011–2013. Ninety seven percent of these CAWCS PD claims had a Medi-Cal price. Alternative mechanisms provided a price for fewer claims; NADAC 94.23%, AWP 90.94%, FUL 73.11%, WAC 66.98%, and DP 14.33%. Among CAWCS drugs with no Medi-Cal price in PD claims, AWP, WAC, NADAC, DP, and FUL provided prices for 96.7%, 63.14%, 24.82%, 20.83%, and 15.08% of claims. Overall CAWCS paid 100.52% of Medi-Cal, 60% of AWP, 97% of WAC, 309.53% of FUL, 103.83% of DP, and 136.27% of NADAC.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;CAWCS current Medi-Cal fee-schedule price list for PD drugs is more complete than all alternative fee-schedules. However, all reimbursement approaches would require combinations of pricing benchmarks. We suggest keeping primary reimbursement at 100% of Medi-Cal and for drugs without a primary Medi-Cal price calculating the maximum fee as 60% of AWP and then 97% of WAC. Alternatively, we suggest using NADAC as a primary fee-schedule followed by either 60% AWP and 97% WAC or AWP-40% for drugs with no NADAC price.

Background and aim &lt;p&gt;Sarcopenic obesity is a risk factor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to generate a predictive score of sarcopenia occurrence one year after bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Patients and methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted an observational prospective cohort study on a total of 184 severely obese patients admitted to our institution to undergo sleeve gastrectomy. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the third lumbar vertebrae (SMA, cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was measured from the routinely performed computed tomography. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as follows: SMA/height&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI &amp;lt; 38.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for women and &amp;lt; 52.4 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for men. Measurements were performed at surgery and one year later.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Most of the included patients were female (79%), with a mean age of 42±0.9 years and body mass index of 43.2±0.5 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Fifteen patients (8%) had sarcopenia before surgery and 59 (32%) at the one-year follow-up. Male gender (p&amp;lt;0.0001), SMA before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001), and SMI before surgery (p&amp;lt;0.0001) significantly correlated with the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after surgery by multivariate analysis. Two predictive sarcopenia occurrence scores were constructed using SMA and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt;) or SMI and gender (&lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt;). The area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; was significantly greater than that of the &lt;i&gt;SS1 score&lt;/i&gt; for the diagnosis of postoperative sarcopenia occurrence (0.95±0.02 &lt;i&gt;versus&lt;/i&gt; 0.90±0.02; p&amp;lt;0.01). A cut-off value for the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; of 0.53 had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. In the group of patients without baseline sarcopenia, the &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; had still an excellent AUROC of 0.92±0.02. A cut-off of 0.55 predicted development of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy in these patients with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 88%, and negative predictive value of 95%.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SS2 score&lt;/i&gt; has excellent predictive value for the occurrence of sarcopenia one year after sleeve gastrectomy.

Heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; mutations in humans and mice cause severe ocular anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). Abnormalities include pupil displacement, corneal opacity, iridocorneal adhesions, and variable intraocular pressure, as well as some retinal and vascular defects. It is presently not known what source of BMP4 is responsible for these defects, as BMP4 is expressed in several developing ocular and surrounding tissues. In particular, BMP4 is expressed in the ciliary margins of the optic cup which give rise to anterior segment structures such as the ciliary body and iris, making it a good candidate for the required source of BMP4 for anterior segment development. Here, we test whether ciliary margin-derived BMP4 is required for ocular development using two different conditional knockout approaches. In addition, we compared the conditional deletion phenotypes with &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous null mice. Morphological, molecular, and functional assays were performed on adult mutant mice, including histology, immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging, and intraocular pressure measurements. Surprisingly, in contrast to &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mutants, our analyses revealed that the anterior and posterior segments of &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; conditional knockouts developed normally. These results indicate that ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development, although subtle alterations could not be ruled out. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the anterior and posterior phenotypes observed in &lt;i&gt;Bmp4&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous animals showed a strong propensity to co-occur, suggesting a common, non-cell autonomous source for these defects.</description><published>1525813200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197048</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Ciliary margin-derived BMP4 does not have a major role in ocular development</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rebecca L.

We have developed our original tissue engineering technology “cell sheet engineering” utilizing temperature-responsive culture dishes. The cells are confluently grown on a temperature-responsive culture dish and can be harvested as a cell sheet by lowering temperature without enzymatic digestion. Cell sheets are high-cell-density tissues similar to actual living tissues, maintaining their structure and function. Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Contractile force measurement of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissue</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sasaki, Katsuhisa Matsuura, Hiroyoshi Seta, Yuji Haraguchi, Teruo Okano, Tatsuya Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;

Based on this “cell sheet engineering”, we are trying to create functional cardiac tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells, for regenerative therapy and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing. Toward this purpose, it is necessary to evaluate the contractility of engineered cardiac cell sheets. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a contractile force measurement system and evaluated the contractility of human iPSC-derived cardiac cell sheet-tissues. By attaching the cardiac cell sheets on fibrin gel sheets, we created dynamically beating cardiac cell sheet-tissues. They were mounted to the force measurement system and the contractile force was measured stably and clearly. The absolute values of contractile force were around 1 mN, and the mean force value per cross-sectional area was 3.3 mN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These values are equivalent to or larger than many previously reported values, indicating the functionality of our engineered cardiac cell sheets. We also confirmed that both the contractile force and beating rate were significantly increased by the administration of adrenaline, which are the physiologically relevant responses for cardiac tissues. In conclusion, the force measurement system developed in the present study is valuable for the evaluation of engineered cardiac cell sheet-tissues, and for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug testing as well.</content></content><updated>1527109200000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Daisuke Sasaki</name></author><fingerprint>c05af95</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</href></item></alternate><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198026</link></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527586086955</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163ab39e02b:1de453f:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04478-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turbulent superstructures in Rayleigh-Bénard convection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turbulent superstructures in Rayleigh-Bénard convection, Published online: 29 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04478-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04478-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Turbulent fluids in nature, counter-intuitively, can exhibit large-scale order that persists for long times.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex.

As compared with type I ligands, binding of a type II compound often achieves longer residence time. We developed a novel virtual drug screening package which takes advantage of two energy evaluation methods: Superposition and Single-Point Energy Evaluation, and VM2 free energy calculation, and applied it to the discovery of new CDK8 type II ligands. In this research we analyzed binding thermodynamics of 11 published CDK8 type II ligands, and extracted the key binding information to assist virtual drug screening for new ligands. The free energy and MD calculations on the reference CDK8-ligand complexes revealed the important factors in the binding. The urea moiety was found to be the critical structural contributor of the reference ligands. Starting with the urea moiety we implemented virtual drug screening and singled out three compounds for bio-assay testing. The ranking from the experimental result for the three compounds is completely consistent with the predicted rankings by both energy evaluation methods. A potent drug-like compound was discovered to have a Kd value of 42.5 nM with CDK8, which is comparable to the most potent reference ligands and provided a good starting point to design and synthesize a series of highly selective and potent CDK8 ligands. Therefore, our novel virtual drug screening package is accurate and efficient enough to be used in drug design projects.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a well-established modality for the treatment of advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, the detrimental effects of intramedullary reaming used in conventional TKA for distal femur cutting are of concern. Avoiding intramedullary reaming with the use of computer-assisted navigation TKA can not only provide superior prosthetic alignment, but also mitigate perioperative blood loss and the dissipation of marrow emboli. We quantified local and systemic concentrations of inflammation markers for both techniques. Forty-four participants undergoing computer-assisted navigation and 53 receiving conventional TKA for advanced knee OA were recruited between 2013/02/08 and 2015/12/09. Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline then again at 24 and 72 hours postoperatively and analyzed by ELISA for interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1); these markers were also measured in Hemovac drain fluid collected at 24 and 72 hours. Serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and TGF-β1(unit for all markers: pg/mL) were increased from baseline by smaller increments in the navigation TKA cohort compared with the conventional TKA group at 24 hours (17.06 vs 29.39, p = 0.02; 0.51 vs 0.83, p = 0.16; –0.04 vs 0.36, p &amp;lt; 0.01 and –48.18 vs 63.24, p&amp;lt; 0.01, respectively) and at 72 hours (12.27 vs 16.87, p = 0.01; –0.40 vs 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01; 0.58 vs 0.98, p = 0.07 and –55.16 vs 63.71, p &amp;lt; 0.01, respectively). IL-10 levels in drainage fluids collected 24 hours after TKA were also significantly lower in the navigation group versus the conventional TKA group (8.55 vs 12.32, p &amp;lt; 0.01). According to our evidence, the merits of computer-assisted navigation TKA are augmented by low levels of inflammation markers.</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197097</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Effects of computer-assisted navigation versus conventional total knee arthroplasty on the levels of inflammation markers: A prospective study</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Shu-Jui Kuo, Horng-Chaung Hsu, Ching-Jen Wang, Ka-Kit Siu, Ya-Hung Hsu, Jih-Yang Ko, Chih-Hsin Tang&lt;/p&gt;

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time.

Computational models of cholera transmission can provide objective insights into the course of an ongoing epidemic and aid decision making on allocation of health care resources. However, models are typically designed, calibrated and interpreted &lt;i&gt;post-hoc&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we report the efforts of a team from academia, field research and humanitarian organizations to model in near real-time the Haitian cholera outbreak after Hurricane Matthew in October 2016, to assess risk and to quantitatively estimate the efficacy of a then ongoing vaccination campaign. A rainfall-driven, spatially-explicit meta-community model of cholera transmission was coupled to a data assimilation scheme for computing short-term projections of the epidemic in near real-time. The model was used to forecast cholera incidence for the months after the passage of the hurricane (October-December 2016) and to predict the impact of a planned oral cholera vaccination campaign. Our first projection, from October 29 to December 31, predicted the highest incidence in the departments of Grande Anse and Sud, accounting for about 45% of the total cases in Haiti. The projection included a second peak in cholera incidence in early December largely driven by heavy rainfall forecasts, confirming the urgency for rapid intervention. A second projection (from November 12 to December 31) used updated rainfall forecasts to estimate that 835 cases would be averted by vaccinations in Grande Anse (90% Prediction Interval [PI] 476-1284) and 995 in Sud (90% PI 508-2043). The experience gained by this modeling effort shows that state-of-the-art computational modeling and data-assimilation methods can produce informative near real-time projections of cholera incidence. Collaboration among modelers and field epidemiologists is indispensable to gain fast access to field data and to translate model results into operational recommendations for emergency management during an outbreak. Future efforts should thus draw together multi-disciplinary teams to ensure model outputs are appropriately based, interpreted and communicated.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXysUXWSU_g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><updated>1526504400000</updated><origin><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Damiano Pasetto</name></author><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006127</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rXysUXWSU_g/article</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526503332228</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1527845332130</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_163baada4a2:3727a7f:2835af05</id><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04415-1</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cellular conditions of weakly chelated magnesium ions strongly promote RNA stability and catalysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular conditions of weakly chelated magnesium ions strongly promote RNA stability and catalysis, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04415-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04415-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The concentration of divalent cations is well-known to influence molecular processes such as enzymatic activity and RNA folding.

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers.

Organic chemists like what it can do (cyclopropane formation, cycloadditions, fast, clean methyl ester formation, etc.), but the compound itself is very hard to have warm feelings for. It’s unstable on storage, and thus has to be prepared fresh. That preparation is fairly tedious, and you have to pay close attention to what you’re doing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/04/30/how_not_to_do_it_diazomethane&quot;&gt;unlike this guy&lt;/a&gt;), because the diazomethane product can and will decompose violently (and even explode) if you mishandle it. “Mishandle” includes, but is not limited to, making it too concentrated, exposing it to friction or rough surfaces, the presence of metals, etc. It’s also quite volatile and very toxic, explosions aside. That goes even for the less explosive form, trimethylsilyldiazomethane, which is stable enough to be an article of commerce but which is sadly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/05/14/tms_diazomethane_update_on_a_fatality&quot;&gt;just as deadly&lt;/a&gt; as the original item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why you don’t see an awful lot of plain diazo compounds in the literature. The stabilized ones like ethyl diazoacetate are pretty common, but when’s the last time you heard about diazopropane? Or cyclopropyldiazomethane? Right, probably never, and that’s largely because the higher diazos, being less volatile, are no fun to prepare because you can’t distill them over in ether like you can the parent compound. By the time you’ve purified them, there’s not much left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802092?af=R&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt;, though, could change that. A group at Montréal has adapted a solution-phase prep (silver oxide and potassium carbonate) to flow chemistry, which is the natural home for these kinds of compounds. (&lt;em&gt;Update: see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201710445&quot;&gt;this recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Ley group – another flow approach&lt;/em&gt;). Running hydrazones in dichloromethane through a column of these reagents (mixed with Celite) gives you diazo compounds out the other end. But you can tell that these are lively compounds – when they tried this on acetone hydrazone at room temperature, they got a colorless stream and plenty of gas bubbles, because the 2-diazopropane had already decomposed. Lowering the temperature to -20C and cranking up the flow rate, though, gave a red solution which is the real thing, ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used this setup to produce a whole range of basically unknown diazo compounds (they’re yellow, orange, red, and purple in solution), and took them directly into esterification, cycloaddition, and cyclopropanation reactions. You’re not going to let these things sit around; unstabilized diazo formation is going to be an on-demand process no matter how it’s done. But it looks like these compounds are now open to experimentation in a way that they’ve never been before.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><title>Diazos On Demand</title><origin><title>In the Pipeline</title><htmlUrl>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/feed</streamId></origin><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><fingerprint>44adea29</fingerprint><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/05/15/diazos-on-demand</href></item></alternate><recrawled>1526483538981</recrawled></item><item><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd2:2835af05</id><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197105</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blanca E.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs).

The estimation of these hidden population size changes from reconstructed sequence phylogenies, is an important problem in many biological fields. Often, population size is described by a piecewise-constant function, with each piece serving as a parameter to be estimated. Estimate quality depends on both the statistical inference method used, and on the experimental protocol, which controls variables such as the sampling or parametrisation, employed. While there is a burgeoning literature focussed on inference method development, there is surprisingly little work on experimental design.

The estimation of these hidden population size changes from reconstructed sequence phylogenies, is an important problem in many biological fields. Often, population size is described by a piecewise-constant function, with each piece serving as a parameter to be estimated. Estimate quality depends on both the statistical inference method used, and on the experimental protocol, which controls variables such as the sampling or parametrisation, employed. While there is a burgeoning literature focussed on inference method development, there is surprisingly little work on experimental design. Moreover, these works are largely simulation based, and therefore cannot provide provable or general designs. As a result, many existing protocols are heuristic or method specific.

Cannibalism is a commonly observed phenomenon in arthropod species having relevant consequences for population dynamics and individual fitness. It is a context-dependent behaviour and an understanding of the factors affecting cannibalism rate is crucial to highlight its ecological relevance. In mosquitoes, cannibalism between larval stages has been widely documented, and the role of density, food availability and length of contact between individuals also ascertained. However, although mosquitoes can develop in temporary water habitats with very heterogeneous topologies, the role of the site shape where cannibals and victims co-occur has been instead overlooked. In this paper, we investigated this issue by using a simulation approach and laboratory cannibalism experiments between old (third- and fourth-instars) and young (first-instar) larvae of the tiger mosquito &lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&lt;/i&gt;. Three virtual spaces with different shapes were simulated and the number of larval encounters was estimated in each one to assess whether the spatial shape affected the number of encounters between cannibal and victims. Then, experimental trials in containers with similar shapes to those used in the simulations were performed, and the cannibalism rate was estimated at 24 and 48h. Our results showed that the spatial shape plays a role on cannibalism interactions, affecting the number of encounters between individuals. Indeed, in the experimental trials performed, we observed the highest cannibalism rate in the container with the highest number of encounters predicted by the simulations. Interestingly, we found also that spatial shape can affect cannibalism not only by affecting the number of encounters, but also the number of encounters “favorable” for cannibalistic events. Temporary waters are inhabited by several species other than mosquitoes. Our results, showing an influence of the spatial shape on cannibalism in &lt;i&gt;Ae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;albopictus&lt;/i&gt; larvae, add a new critical factor to those affecting ecological interactions in these habitats.</description><published>1527627600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198194</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Cannibalism in temporary waters: Simulations and laboratory experiments revealed the role of spatial shape in the mosquito &amp;lt;i&gt;Aedes albopictus&amp;lt;/i&gt;</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Valentina Mastrantonio, Graziano Crasta, Arianna Puggioli, Romeo Bellini, Sandra Urbanelli, Daniele Porretta&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range. Polychlorinated biphenyls and various DDT metabolites were the main fish oil pollutants influencing the receptors. Additivity and/or synergy between chemicals was observed in the ER/AR mediated response.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197907</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Endocrine disrupting potency of organic pollutant mixtures isolated from commercial fish oil evaluated in yeast-based bioassays</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marek Łukasz Roszko, Marta Kamińska, Krystyna Szymczyk, Katarzyna Piasecka-Jóźwiak, Beata Chabłowska&lt;/p&gt;

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</description><published>1526418000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197422</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Lipophilic statins limit cancer cell growth and survival, via involvement of Akt signaling</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Colin H.

Background &lt;p&gt;Effective HIV prevention requires efficient delivery of safe and efficacious drugs and optimization of user adherence. The user’s experiences with the drug, delivery system, and use parameters are critical to product acceptability and adherence. Prevention product developers have the opportunity to directly control a drug delivery system and its impact on acceptability and adherence, as well as product efficacy. Involvement of potential users during preclinical design and development can facilitate this process. We embedded a mixed methods user evaluation study into a safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) trial of a pod-intravaginal ring delivering antiretroviral agents.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology &lt;p&gt;Women enrolled in two cohorts, ultimately evaluating the safety/PK of a pod-IVRs delivering TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, and/or TDF-FTC-MVC. A 7-day use period was targeted for each pod-IVR, regardless of drug or drug combination. During the clinical study, participants provided both quantitative (i.e., survey) and qualitative (i.e., in-depth interview) data capturing acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence behaviors. Initial sexual and reproductive health history surveys, daily diaries, a final acceptability and willingness to use survey, and a qualitative in-depth interview comprised the user evaluation data for each pod-IVR experienced by the participants.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Overall, the majority of participants (N = 10) reported being willing to use the pod-IVR platform for HIV prevention should it advance to market. Confidence to use the pod-IVR (e.g., insertion, removal) was high. There were no differences noted in the user experience of the pod-IVR platform; that is, whether the ring delivered TDF-alone, TDF-FTC, or TDF-FTC-MVC, users’ experiences of the ring were similar and acceptable. Participants did report specific experiences, both sensory and behavioral, that impacted their use behaviors with respect to the ring, and which could ultimately impact acceptability and adherence. These experiences, and user evaluations elicited by them, could both challenge use or be used to leverage use in future trials and product rollout once fully articulated.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High willingness-to-use data and lack of salient differences in user experiences related to use of the pod-IVR platform (regardless of agents delivered) suggests that the pod-IVR is a feasible and acceptable drug delivery device in and of itself. This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526331600000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197269</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>User evaluations offer promise for pod-intravaginal ring as a drug delivery platform: A mixed methods study of acceptability and use experiences</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kate M.

This finding holds promise both for an anti-HIV pod-IVR and, potentially, a multipurpose prevention pod-IVR that could deliver both prevention for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and contraception. Given the very early clinical trial context, further acceptability, perceptibility, and adherence data should continue to be explored, in the context of longer use periods (e.g., 28-day ring use), and in the contexts of sexual activity and menses. Using early design and development contexts to gain insights into potential challenges and facilitators of drug delivery systems such as the pod-IVR could save valuable resources and time as a potential biomedical technology moves through the clinical trial pipeline and into real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><updated>1526331600000</updated><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><author><name>Kate M.

The interplay with bacteria is of crucial importance for the interaction of multicellular organisms with their environments. Studying the associations between the nematode model organisms &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus pacificus&lt;/i&gt; with bacteria constitutes a powerful system to investigate these interactions at a mechanistic level. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt; is found in association with scarab beetles in nature and recent studies revealed the succession and dynamics of this nematode and its microbiome during the decomposition of one particular host species, the rhinoceros beetle &lt;i&gt;Oryctes borbonicus&lt;/i&gt; on La Réunion Island. However, these studies were performed using culture-free methods, with no attempt made to establish bacterial cultures from the beetle-nematode ecosystem and to investigate the effects of these microbes on life history traits in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pacificus&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we establish and characterize a collection of 136 bacterial strains that have been isolated from scarab beetles and figs, another &lt;i&gt;Pristionchus&lt;/i&gt;-associated environment, as a resource for studying their effect on various nematode traits. Classification based on 16S sequencing identified members of four bacterial phyla with the class of Gammaproteobacteria representing the majority with 81 strains.

Although performance feedback is widely employed as a means to improve motivation, the efficacy and reliability of performance feedback is often obscured by individual differences and situational variables. The joint role of these moderating variables remains unknown. Accordingly, we investigate how the motivational impact of feedback is moderated by personality and task-difficulty. Utilizing three samples (total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 916), we explore how Big Five personality traits moderate the motivational impact of false positive and negative feedback on playful, neutral, and frustrating puzzle tasks, respectively. Conscientious and Neurotic individuals together appear particularly sensitive to task difficulty, becoming significantly more motivated by negative feedback on playful tasks and demotivated by negative feedback on frustrating tasks. Results are discussed in terms of Goal-Setting and Self Determination Theory. Implications for industry and education are considered.</description><published>1527022800000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197810</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Improving the effectiveness of performance feedback by considering personality traits and task demands</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Victor Swift, Jordan B.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</description><published>1527109200000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197833</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Early prediction of contrast-induced acute kidney injury by a &quot;bedside&quot; assessment of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin during elective percutaneous coronary interventions</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1526504400000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197523</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in Korean patients with node negative T1c, triple negative breast cancer</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Taek Lim, Chan Heun Park, Sung Yong Kim, Seok Jin Nam, Eun Young Kang, Byung-In Moon, Hyouk Jin Lee, Ye Won Jeon, Hongki Gwak, Young Jin Suh&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;To highlight the differences in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy control eyes, to assess the changes in MPOD in eyes treated with macular peeling, to investigate the relationships between MPOD changes and measures of retinal sensitivity such as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and microperimetry.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional comparative study, 30 eyes affected by idiopathic epiretinal membrane (iERM, 15eyes) or full-thickness macular hole (FTMH, 15eyes) were compared with 60 eyes from 30 healthy age-matched patients. MPOD values (mean MPOD, maximum MPOD, MPOD area, and MPOD volume) were measured in a range of 4°–7° of eccentricity around the fovea, using the one-wavelength reflectometry method (Visucam 200, Carl-Zeiss Meditec). Patients affected by iERM and FTMH were treated with vitrectomy and epiretinal membrane-inner limiting membrane (ERM-ILM) peeling, with follow-up examinations performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. The main outcome measures were the differences in MPOD between eyes with vitreoretinal interface syndrome and healthy eyes, changes in MPOD after ERM-ILM peeling, and relationships between MPOD and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Mean MPOD differed significantly between control eyes and those with iERM (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0001) or FTMH (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .0006). The max MPOD and MPOD area increased, but not significantly. After peeling, the only significant change in MPOD was in MPOD volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .01). In the ERM group, postoperative mean MPOD correlated significantly with best-corrected visual acuity (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = .739, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .002).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MPOD was reduced in patients with iERM or FTMH compared with healthy eyes. We found a significant correlation between the mean postoperative MPOD and postoperative BCVA, hypothesizing that the postoperative increase in mean MPOD could be due to a change in distribution for unfolding and expansion of the fovea after the peeling.

However, the actual state of the body of bioinformatics software remains largely unknown. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the state of source code in the bioinformatics community, specifically looking at relationships between code properties, development activity, developer communities, and software impact. To investigate these issues, we curated a list of 1,720 bioinformatics repositories on GitHub through their mention in peer-reviewed bioinformatics articles. Additionally, we included 23 high-profile repositories identified by their popularity in an online bioinformatics forum. We analyzed repository metadata, source code, development activity, and team dynamics using data made available publicly through the GitHub API, as well as article metadata. We found key relationships within our dataset, including: certain scientific topics are associated with more active code development and higher community interest in the repository; most of the code in the main dataset is written in dynamically typed languages, while most of the code in the high-profile set is statically typed; developer team size is associated with community engagement and high-profile repositories have larger teams; the proportion of female contributors decreases for high-profile repositories and with seniority level in author lists; and, multiple measures of project impact are associated with the simple variable of whether the code was modified at all after paper publication. In addition to providing the first large-scale analysis of bioinformatics code to our knowledge, our work will enable future analysis through publicly available data, code, and methods.

Nucleobase transporters are also evaluated as potential targets for antimicrobial therapies, since several pathogenic microorganisms rely on purine/pyrimidine salvage from their hosts. The majority of known nucleobase transporters belong to the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitous NAT/NCS2 protein family. Based on a large-scale phylogenetic analysis that we performed on thousands of prokaryotic proteomes, we have developed a webserver that can detect and distinguish this family of transporters from other homologous families that recognize different substrates.

The webserver scans whole proteomes and graphically displays which proteins are identified as NAT/NCS2, to which evolutionary groups and subgroups they belong to and which conserved motifs they have. For key subgroups and motifs, the server displays annotated information from published crystal-structures and mutational studies pointing to key functional amino acids that may help experts assess the transport capability of the target sequences. The server is 100% accurate in detecting NAT/NCS2 family members. We also used the server to analyze 9109 prokaryotic proteomes and identified Clostridia, Bacilli, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria as the taxa with the largest number of NAT/NCS2 transporters per proteome.

Prevalence and molecular epidemiology studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus are scarce in Warao Amerindians from Venezuela, where an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has recently been documented. To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer ≥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</description><published>1527282000000</published><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197662</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><title>Decreasing prevalence of Hepatitis B and absence of Hepatitis C Virus infection in the Warao indigenous population of Venezuela</title><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Ruth Y.
