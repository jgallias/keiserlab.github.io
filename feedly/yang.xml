The behaviour of most animals has evolved in a communication network environment, in which signals produced by senders are perceived by many intended and unintended receivers. In this study, we tested whether the corncrake (&lt;i&gt;Crex crex&lt;/i&gt;), a nocturnal rail species with innate (non-learned) calls, is able to eavesdrop on the interactions of conspecific males and how this eavesdropping affects subsequent responses by the eavesdropper to territorial intrusion. In the first step, simulated aggressive or neutral interactions between male dyads were presented to a focal male. In the second step, the calls of winning, losing or neutral males from the first step were played within the territory of the focal male. We measured behavioural and vocal responses of focal males. We found that corncrakes eavesdropped on signal exchange between rivals. Males often began responding to distant aggressive interactions during the eavesdropping phase, and they responded strongly during the intrusion phase of the experiments. The response was significantly weaker to playback of males from neutral interactions than to those involved in aggressive interactions, and we found no differences between the responses to Winners and Losers entering a focal male territory.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526677200000</published><author><name>Lucyna Ewa Wojas</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucyna Ewa Wojas, Paweł Wojciech Podkowa, Tomasz Stanisław Osiejuk&lt;/p&gt;

A prior project found that an intensive (12 weeks, thrice weekly sessions) in-person, supervised, exercise coaching intervention was effective for smoking cessation among depressed women smokers. However, the sample was 90% White and of high socioeconomic status, and the intensity of the intervention limits its reach. One approach to intervention scalability is to deliver the supervised exercise coaching using a robotic human exercise trainer. This is done in real time via an iPad tablet placed on a mobile robotic wheel base and controlled remotely by an iOS device or computer. As an initial step, this preliminary study surveyed potential receptivity to a robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention among 100 adults recruited in two community settings, and explored the association of technology acceptance scores with smoking status and other demographics. Participants watched a brief demonstration of the robot-delivered exercise coaching and completed a 19-item survey assessing socio-demographics and technology receptivity measured by the 8-item Technology Acceptance Scale (TAS). Open-ended written feedback was obtained, and content analysis was used to derive themes from these data. Respondents were: 40% female, 56% unemployed, 41% racial minority, 38% current smoker, and 58% depression history. Mean total TAS score was 34.0 (SD = 5.5) of possible 40, indicating overall very good receptivity to the robotic-assisted exercise intervention concept. Racial minorities and unemployed participants reported greater technology acceptance than White (p = 0.015) and employed (p&amp;lt;0.001) respondents. No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Christi Patten</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Christi Patten, James Levine, Ioannis Pavlidis, Joyce Balls-Berry, Arya Shah, Christine Hughes, Tabetha Brockman, Miguel Valdez Soto, Daniel Witt, Gabriel Koepp, Pamela Sinicrope, Jamie Richards&lt;/p&gt;

No association was detected between the TAS score and smoking status, depression, gender or age groups. Qualitative feedback indicated the robot was perceived as a novel, motivating, way to increase intervention reach and accessibility, and the wave of the future. Robotic technology has potential applicability for exercise coaching in a broad range of populations, including depressed smokers. Our next step will be to conduct a pilot trial to assess acceptability and potential efficacy of the robotic-assisted exercise coaching intervention for smoking cessation.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197090</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>78e7420f</fingerprint><title>[ASAP] One-Pot Isolation of a Desired Human Genome Fragment by Using a Biotinylated pcPNA/S1 Nuclease Combination</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00202/20180509/images/medium/bi-2018-00202w_0005.gif</url><height>500</height><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_16349fdd242:2b9831:f3bf0074</id><published>1525924800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00202</href></item></canonical><author><name>Arivazhagan Rajendran, Narumi Shigi, Jun Sumaoka, Makoto Komiyama</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00202/20180509/images/medium/bi-2018-00202w_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00202&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Isolated mitochondria are widely used to study the function of the organelle. Typically, mitochondria are prepared using differential centrifugation alone or in conjunction with density gradient ultracentrifugation. However, mitochondria isolated using differential centrifugation contain membrane or organelle contaminants, and further purification of crude mitochondria by density gradient ultracentrifugation requires large amounts of starting material, and is time-consuming. Mitochondria have also been isolated by irreversible binding to antibody-coated magnetic beads. We developed a method to prepare mitochondria from budding yeast that overcomes many of the limitations of other methods. Mitochondria are tagged by insertion of 6 histidines (6xHis) into the &lt;i&gt;TOM70&lt;/i&gt; (Translocase of outer membrane 70) gene at its chromosomal locus, isolated using Ni-NTA (nickel (II) nitrilotriacetic acid) paramagnetic beads and released from the magnetic beads by washing with imidazole. Mitochondria prepared using this method contain fewer contaminants, and are similar in ultrastructure as well as protein import and cytochrome c oxidase complex activity compared to mitochondria isolated by differential centrifugation. Moreover, this isolation method is amenable to small samples, faster than purification by differential and density gradient centrifugation, and more cost-effective than purification using antibody-coated magnetic beads. Importantly, this method can be applied to any cell type where the genetic modification can be introduced by CRISPR or other methods.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Pin-Chao Liao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pin-Chao Liao, Istvan R.

Although the GAL4 system has been used for 25 years, recent genetic intersectional tools have enabled genetic targeting of very small numbers of neurons aiding in the understanding of their function. This split-GAL4 system is extremely powerful for studying neuronal morphology and the neural basis of animal behavior. However, choosing lines to intersect that have overlapping patterns restricted to one to a few neurons has been cumbersome. This challenge is now growing as the collections of GAL4 driver lines has increased. Here we present a new method and software plug-in for Fiji to dramatically improve the speed of querying large databases of potential lines to intersect and aid in the split-GAL4 creation.

Although the GAL4 system has been used for 25 years, recent genetic intersectional tools have enabled genetic targeting of very small numbers of neurons aiding in the understanding of their function. This split-GAL4 system is extremely powerful for studying neuronal morphology and the neural basis of animal behavior. However, choosing lines to intersect that have overlapping patterns restricted to one to a few neurons has been cumbersome. This challenge is now growing as the collections of GAL4 driver lines has increased. Here we present a new method and software plug-in for Fiji to dramatically improve the speed of querying large databases of potential lines to intersect and aid in the split-GAL4 creation. We also provide pre-computed datasets for the Janelia GAL4 (5,738 lines) and VT GAL4 (7,429 lines) of the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS). The tool reduced our split-GAL4 creation effort dramatically.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/09/318006</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318006v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1525874324544</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318006v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318006v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>d54ad226</fingerprint><title>Ularcirc: Visualisation and enhanced analysis of circular RNAs via back and canonical forward splicing [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163647150a9:3944afc:93d646dc</id><content><content>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique class of transcripts that can only be identified from sequence alignments spanning discordant junctions, commonly referred to as backsplice junctions (BSJ).

Ankyrin repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (&lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been widely related to neuropsychiatry disorders. The localization of ANKK1 in neural progenitors and its correlation with the cell cycle has suggested its participation in development. However, ANKK1 functions still need to be identified. Here, we have further characterized the ANKK1 localization &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, by using immunolabeling, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot in the myogenic lineage. Histologic investigations in mice and humans revealed that ANKK1 is expressed in precursors of embryonic and adult muscles. In mice embryos, ANKK1 was found in migrating myotubes where it shows a polarized cytoplasmic distribution, while proliferative myoblasts and satellite cells show different isoforms in their nuclei and cytoplasm. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies of ANKK1 protein isoforms along the myogenic progression showed the decline of nuclear ANKK1-kinase until its total exclusion in myotubes. In adult mice, ANKK1 was expressed exclusively in the Fast-Twitch muscles fibers subtype. The induction of glycolytic metabolism in C2C12 cells with high glucose concentration or treatment with berberine caused a significant increase in the &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Similarly, C2C12 cells under hypoxic conditions caused the increase of nuclear ANKK1. These results altogether show a relationship between &lt;i&gt;ANKK1&lt;/i&gt; gene regulation and the metabolism of muscles during development and in adulthood.

Unpasteurized dairy products are known to occasionally harbor &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and have been implicated in recent listeriosis outbreaks and numerous sporadic cases of listeriosis. However, the diversity and virulence profiles of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from these products have not been fully described. Here we report a genomic analysis of 121 &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from milk, milk filters, and milking equipment collected from bovine dairy farms in 19 states over a 12-year period. In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Seon Woo Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seon Woo Kim, Julie Haendiges, Eric N.

In a multi-virulence-locus sequence typing (MVLST) analysis, 59 Virulence Types (VT) were identified, of which 25% were Epidemic Clones I, II, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and 31 were novel VT. In a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis, 60 Sequence Types (ST) of 56 Clonal Complexes (CC) were identified. Within lineage I, CC5 and CC1 were among the most abundant, and within lineage II, CC7 and CC37 were the most abundant. Multiple CCs previously associated with central nervous system and maternal-neonatal infections were identified. A genomic analysis identified variable distribution of virulence markers, &lt;i&gt;Listeria&lt;/i&gt; pathogenicity islands (LIPI) -1, -3, and -4, and stress survival island-1 (SSI-1). Of these, 14 virulence markers, including LIPI-3 and -4 were more frequently detected in one lineage (I or II) than the other. LIPI-3 and LIPI-4 were identified in 68% and 28% of lineage I CCs, respectively. Results of this analysis indicate that there is a high level of genetic diversity among the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; present in bulk tank milk in the United States with some strains being more frequently detected than others, and some being similar to those that have been isolated from previous non-dairy related outbreaks. Results of this study also demonstrate significant number of strains isolated from dairy farms encode virulence markers associated with severe human disease.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197053</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>7f633c7a</fingerprint><title>Recurrent bridgehead effects accelerate global alien ant spread [Ecology]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/21.cover-source.jpg?itok=3_ebjn-v</url><height>480</height><width>359</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_16388d6a7d9:6ccef84:3dd877af</id><content><content>Biological invasions are a major threat to biological diversity, agriculture, and human health.

Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities.

Background &lt;p&gt;Transgender persons are highly victimized, marginalized, disproportionately experience incarceration, and have alarmingly increased rates of HIV infection compared to cis-gender persons. Few studies have examined the HIV care continuum outcomes among transgender women (TW), particularly TW who are involved with the criminal justice (CJ) system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding of HIV care continuum outcomes and risk behaviors among HIV-infected TW who are involved with the CJ system, we analyzed data from the National Institute on Drug Abuse-supported Seek, Test, Treat, Retain (STTR) Data Harmonization Initiative. Baseline data were pooled and analyzed from three U.S. STTR studies to examine HIV risk and care continuum indicators among CJ-involved HIV-infected TW compared to cisgender men (CM), matched on age (within 5 years) and study at a ratio of 1:5.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighty-eight TW and 440 CM were included in the study. Among matched participants, TW were more likely to report crack and cocaine use compared to CM (40%,16% respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001); both TW and CM reported high rates of condomless sex (58%, 64%, respectively); TW were more likely than CM to have more than one sexual partner (OR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.2; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and have engaged in exchange sex (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 2.3, 6.6; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between TW and CM in the percentage currently taking ART (52%, 49%, respectively), the mean percent adherence to ART (77% for both groups), and the proportion who achieved viral suppression (61%, 58%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;HIV-infected CJ-involved TW and CM had similar use of ART and viral suppression but TW were more likely than matched CM to engage in exchange sex, have multiple sexual partners, and use crack/cocaine. TW and CM had similarly high rates of condomless sex and use of other drugs.

We found that generalization of avoidance could be parsed into perceptual and value-based processes, and further, that value-based generalization could be subdivided into that relating to aversive and neutral feedback − with corresponding circuits including primary sensory cortex, anterior insula, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Further, generalization from aversive, but not neutral, feedback was associated with self-reported anxiety and intrusive thoughts. These results reveal a set of distinct mechanisms that mediate generalization in avoidance learning, and show how specific individual differences within them can yield anxiety.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34779</canonicalUrl><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34779</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><summary><content>Generalization during aversive decision-making allows us to avoid a broad range of potential threats following experience with a limited set of exemplars.

We found that generalization of avoidance could be parsed into perceptual and value-based processes, and further, that value-based generalization could be subdivided into that relating to aversive and neutral feedback − with corresponding circuits including primary sensory cortex, anterior insula, amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Further, generalization from aversive, but not neutral, feedback was associated with self-reported anxiety and intrusive thoughts. These results reveal a set of distinct mechanisms that mediate generalization in avoidance learning, and show how specific individual differences within them can yield anxiety.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><author><name>aen31@cam.ac.uk (Agnes Norbury)</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34779</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>e94fe4ec</fingerprint><title>Family-based haplotype estimation and allele dosage correction for polyploids using short sequence reads [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1634538e0f4:bc6269:2835af05</id><content><content>DNA sequence reads contain information about the genomic variants located on a single chromosome.

A new set of efficient solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) force fields was developed for phospholipids and peptides. To enhance transferability, this model maps around four heavy atoms and their connected hydrogen atoms into a coarse-grained elementary bead based on functional group. The effective hybrid potential between any pair of beads is composed of a short-range repulsive soft-core potential that directly adopts the form of an explicit-solvent DPD model and a long-range attractive hydrophobic potential. The parameters of the attractive potentials for lipid molecules were obtained by fitting the explicit-solvent DPD simulation of one bead of any type in a water box, then finely tuning it until the bilayer membrane properties obtained in the explicit-solvent model were matched.

The structural and elastic properties of bilayer membranes, free energy profiles for a lipid flip-flop and amino acid analogues translocating across the membrane, and membrane pore formation induced by antimicrobial peptides obtained from this solvent-free DPD force field considerably agreed with the explicit-solvent DPD results.

We present a new modeling and computational tool that computes rigorous summaries of network dynamics over large sets of parameter values. These summaries, organized in a database, can be searched for observed dynamics, e.g., bistability and hysteresis, to discover parameter regimes over which they are supported. We illustrate our approach on several networks underlying the restriction point of the cell cycle in humans and yeast. We rank networks by how robustly they support hysteresis, which is the observed phenotype. We find that the best 6-node human network and the yeast network share similar topology and robustness of hysteresis, in spite of having no homology between the corresponding nodes of the network. Our approach provides a new tool linking network structure and dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/StTE5SEaAR8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006121</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006121</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomáš Gedeon, Bree Cummins, Shaun Harker, Konstantin Mischaikow&lt;/p&gt;

The protozoan &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; sp. cause diseases in humans and animals. Studies of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;brucei&lt;/i&gt; cell biology have revealed unique features, such as major endocytic events being limited to a single region, and mitochondrial genome segregation mediated via basal bodies. Further understanding of trypanosome cell biology can be facilitated with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. Lack of a plasma membrane probe for fixed trypanosomes remains a persistent problem in need of a working solution. Herein, we report protocols developed using mCLING in super-resolution structured illumination fluorescence microscopy (SR-SIM). mCLING comprehensively labels flagellar membranes, including nascent intracellular stages. To extend its usefulness for trypanosome biology we optimized mCLING in combination with organelle-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence of basal bodies or mitochondria. Then in work with live trypanosomes, we demonstrated internalization of mCLING into endocytic stations that overlap with LysoTracker in acidic organelles. Greater detail of the intracellular location of mCLING was obtained with SR-SIM after pulsing trypanosomes with the probe, and allowing continuous uptake of fluorescent concanavalin A (ConA) destined for lysosomes. In most cases, ConA and mCLING vesicles were juxtaposed but not coincident. A video of the complete image stack at the 15 min time point shows zones of mCLING staining surrounding patches of ConA, consistent with persistence of mCLING in membranes of compartments that contain luminal ConA. In summary, these studies establish mCLING as a versatile trypanosome membrane probe compatible with super-resolution microscopy that can be used for detailed analysis of flagellar membrane biogenesis. In addition, mCLING can be used for immunofluorescence in fixed, permeabilized trypanosomes. Its robust staining of the plasma membrane eliminates a need to overlay transmitted light images on fluorescence pictures obtained from widefield, confocal, or super-resolution microscopy.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526504400000</published><author><name>Justin Wiedeman</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Justin Wiedeman, Kojo Mensa-Wilmot&lt;/p&gt;

Recent studies have concluded that native and invasive species share a common set of trait relationships. However, native species in isolated regions might be functionally constrained by their unique evolutionary histories such that they follow different carbon capture strategies than introduced species. We compared leaf traits relating to resource investment, carbon return, and resource-use efficiency in 16 native (endemic) and three non-native (invasive) species in a temperate forest in Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand. Trait differences were more closely associated with leaf habit than nativity. Deciduous species (including invaders) exhibited greater maximum photosynthetic rates at similar resource costs, which resulted in greater nitrogen- and energy-use efficiencies than evergreen natives. Leaf area was the only trait that differed significantly by nativity (over two-fold larger in invaders). Invaders and deciduous natives both occupied the ‘fast return’ end of the leaf economics spectrum in contrast to the native evergreens which had comparatively slow return on investment. Dominant woody invaders in this forest are physiologically distinct from many New Zealand endemic species, which are overwhelmingly evergreen. It remains unclear whether these trait differences translate to an ecological divergence in plant strategy, but these results suggest that ecophysiological tradeoffs are likely constrained by biogeography.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><author><name>J.

Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is a major mediator of peritoneal fibrosis and reportedly affects expression of the H3K4 methyltransferase, SET7/9. SET7/9-induced H3K4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) critically activates transcription of fibrosis-related genes. In this study, we examined the effect of SET7/9 inhibition on peritoneal fibrosis in mice and in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). We also examined SET7/9 expression in nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Murine peritoneal fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of methylglyoxal (MGO) into male C57/BL6 mice over 21 days. Sinefungin, a SET7/9 inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously just before MGO injection (10 mg/kg). SET7/9 expression was elevated in both MGO-injected mice and nonadherent cells isolated from the effluent of PD patients. SET7/9 expression was positively correlated with dialysate/plasma ratio of creatinine in PD patients. Sinefungin was shown immunohistochemically to suppress expression of mesenchymal cells and collagen deposition, accompanied by decreased H3K4me1 levels. Peritoneal equilibration tests showed that sinefungin attenuated the urea nitrogen transport rate from plasma and the glucose absorption rate from the dialysate. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt;, sinefungin suppressed TGF-β1-induced expression of fibrotic markers and inhibited H3K4me1.

The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><author><name>Rajesh Durairaj</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rajesh Durairaj, Patrick Pageat, Cécile Bienboire-Frosini&lt;/p&gt;

These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197618</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>61dbe436</fingerprint><title>[ASAP] Fluorescent-Labeled Selective Adenosine A2B Receptor Antagonist Enables Competition Binding Assay by Flow Cytometry</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>J+gBTJ3fLKJJhXvbycsPO6dp/EMBx8vQLIPzHkHHEfU=_1636575a54c:15bacf9:abeb7260</id><published>1526356800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01627</href></item></canonical><author><name>Meryem Köse, Sabrina Gollos, Tadeusz Karcz, Amelie Fiene, Fabian Heisig, Andrea Behrenswerth, Katarzyna Kiec-Kononowicz, Vigneshwaran Namasivayam, Christa E.

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526936400000</published><author><name>Susanne Gaube</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susanne Gaube, Dimitrios Tsivrikos, Daniel Dollinger, Eva Lermer&lt;/p&gt;
Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour.

Monitoring of small ruminants for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) has recently become more relevant after two natural scrapie suspected cases of goats were found to be positive for classical BSE (C-BSE). C-BSE probably established itself in this species unrecognized, undermining disease control measures. This opens the possibility that TSEs in goats may remain an animal source for human prion diseases. Currently, there are no data regarding the natural presence of the atypical BSE in caprines. Here we report that C-BSE and L-type atypical BSE (L-BSE) isolates from bovine species are intracerebrally transmissible to goats, with a 100% attack rate and a significantly shorter incubation period and survival time after C-BSE than after L-BSE experimental infection, suggesting a lower species barrier for classical agentin goat. All animals showed nearly the same clinical features of disease characterized by skin lesions, including broken hair and alopecia, and abnormal mental status. Histology and immunohistochemistry showed several differences between C-BSE and L-BSE infection, allowing discrimination between the two different strains. The lymphoreticular involvement we observed in the C-BSE positive goats argues in favour of a peripheral distribution of PrPSc similar to classical scrapie. Western blot and other currently approved screening tests detected both strains in the goats and were able to classify negative control animals. These data demonstrate that active surveillance of small ruminants, as applied to fallen stock and/or healthy slaughter populations in European countries, is able to correctly identify and classify classical and L-BSE and ultimately protect public health.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Elena Vallino Costassa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elena Vallino Costassa, Antonio D’Angelo, Maria Mazza, Daniela Meloni, Elisa Baioni, Cristiana Maurella, Silvia Colussi, Nicola Martinelli, Monica Lo Faro, Elena Berrone, Alessandra Favole, Paola Crociara, Silvia Grifoni, Marina Gallo, Guerino Lombardi, Barbara Iulini, Cristina Casalone, Cristiano Corona&lt;/p&gt;

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006100</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006100</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare, almost exclusively female lung disease linked to inactivating mutations in &lt;i&gt;tuberous sclerosis complex 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TSC2)&lt;/i&gt;, a tumor suppressor gene that controls cell metabolic state and growth via regulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) signaling. mTORC1 is frequently activated in human cancers and, although the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has a cytostatic effect, it is, in general, unable to elicit a robust curative effect or tumor regression. Using RNA-Seq, we identified (1) &lt;i&gt;Insulin-like Growth Factor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt;) as one of the genes with the highest fold-change difference between human &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-null and &lt;i&gt;TSC&lt;/i&gt;2-expressing angiomyolipoma cells from a patient with LAM, and (2) the mouse &lt;i&gt;IGF2&lt;/i&gt; homolog &lt;i&gt;Igf2&lt;/i&gt;, as a top-ranking gene according to fold change between &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). We extended transcript-level findings to protein level, observing increased Igf2 protein expression and Igf2 secretion by &lt;i&gt;Tsc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs. Increased Igf2 expression was not due to epigenetic imprinting, but was partially mediated through the Stat3 pathway and was completely insensitive to rapamycin treatment. An siRNA-mediated decrease of Igf2 resulted in decreased Stat3 phosphorylation, suggesting presence of an autocrine Igf2/Stat3 amplification cycle in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; MEFs.

MRL/MpJ mice have abundant ovarian mast cells (MCs) as compared with other strains at postnatal day 0 (P0); however, they sharply decrease after birth. These ovarian MCs, particularly beneath the ovarian surface epithelium (SE), which express mucosal MC (MMC) marker, might participate in early follicular development. This study investigated the changes in spatiotemporal distribution of MCs in the perinatal MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. At P0 to P7, the MCs were densely localized to the ovary, especially their caudomedial region around the ovary-fimbria connection. The neonatal ovarian MCs showed intermediate characteristics of MMC and connective tissue MC (CTMC), and the latter phenotype became evident with aging. However, the expression ratio of the MMC to CTMC marker increased from P0 to P4 in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovary. Similarly, the ratio of MCs facing SE to total MC number increased with aging, although the number of ovarian MCs decreased, indicating the relative increase in MMC phenotypes in the early neonatal ovary. Neither proliferating nor apoptotic MCs were found in the MRL/MpJ mouse ovaries. The parenchymal cells surrounding MCs at ovary-fimbria connection showed similar molecular expression patterns (E-cadherin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Foxl2&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/Gata4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as that of the ovarian surface epithelial cells. At P2, around the ovary-fimbria connection, c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; immature oocytes formed clusters called nests, and some MCs localized adjacent to c-kit&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; oocytes within the nests. These results indicated that in postnatal MRL/MpJ mice, ovarian MCs changed their distribution by migrating toward the parenchymal cells composing ovary-fimbria connection, which possessed similar characteristics to the ovarian surface epithelium. Thus, we elucidated the spatiotemporal alterations of the ovarian MCs in MRL/MpJ mice, and suggested their importance during the early follicular development by migrating toward the ovary-fimbria connection. MRL/MpJ mice would be useful to elucidate the relationship between neonatal immunity and reproductive systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><author><name>Teppei Nakamura</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Teppei Nakamura, Masataka Chihara, Osamu Ichii, Saori Otsuka-Kanazawa, Ken-ichi Nagasaki, Yaser Hosny Ali Elewa, Osamu Tatsumi, Yasuhiro Kon&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we show a mechanism for sorting and activation of glutamate receptor–like channels (GLRs) by CORNICHON HOMOLOG (CNIH) proteins. Single mutants of pollen-expressed &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; GLRs (&lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLRs) showed growth and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux phenotypes expected for plasma membrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. However, higher-order mutants of &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLR3.3 revealed phenotypes contradicting this assumption. These discrepancies could be explained by subcellular &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLR localization, and we explored the implication of &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;CNIHs in this sorting.

Here, we show a mechanism for sorting and activation of glutamate receptor–like channels (GLRs) by CORNICHON HOMOLOG (CNIH) proteins. Single mutants of pollen-expressed &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; GLRs (&lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLRs) showed growth and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux phenotypes expected for plasma membrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. However, higher-order mutants of &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLR3.3 revealed phenotypes contradicting this assumption. These discrepancies could be explained by subcellular &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;GLR localization, and we explored the implication of &lt;i&gt;At&lt;/i&gt;CNIHs in this sorting.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The pathogenic role of the lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate and its receptor S1PR2 in lung fibrosis is unknown. We show here that genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; strikingly attenuated lung fibrosis induced by repeated injections of bleomycin in mice. We observed by using &lt;i&gt;S1pr&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;LacZ/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice that S1PR2 was expressed in alveolar macrophages, vascular endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells in the lung and that S1PR2-expressing cells accumulated in the fibrotic legions. Bone marrow chimera experiments suggested that S1PR2 in bone marrow–derived cells contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Depletion of macrophages greatly attenuated lung fibrosis. Bleomycin administration stimulated the mRNA expression of the profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-4 and the M2 markers including arginase 1, Fizz1/&lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, Ccl17 and Ccl24 in cells collected from broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF), and &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt; deletion markedly diminished the stimulated expression of these genes. BALF cells from bleomycin–administered wild-type mice showed a marked increase in phosphorylation of STAT6, a transcription factor which is activated downstream of IL-13, compared with saline–administered wild-type mice. Interestingly, in bleomycin–administered &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice, STAT6 phosphorylation in BALF cells was substantially diminished compared with wild-type mice. Finally, pharmacological S1PR2 blockade in &lt;i&gt;S1pr2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice alleviated bleomycin–induced lung fibrosis. Thus, S1PR2 facilitates lung fibrosis through the mechanisms involving augmentation of IL-13 expression and its signaling in BALF cells, and represents a novel target for treating lung fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526936400000</published><author><name>Juanjuan Zhao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juanjuan Zhao, Yasuo Okamoto, Yuya Asano, Kazuhiro Ishimaru, Sho Aki, Kazuaki Yoshioka, Noriko Takuwa, Takashi Wada, Yutaka Inagaki, Chiaki Takahashi, Takumi Nishiuchi, Yoh Takuwa&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) with short pulse duration and non-thermal effects have various potential applications in medicine and biology, especially in tumor ablation. Additionally, there are a few investigations on its proliferative effects in the normal cell. Clinically, proliferation of endothelial cells can perhaps accelerate the stent endothelialization and reduce the risk of acute thrombosis. To explore the feasibility using nsPEFs to induce proliferation of endothelial cells, in this study, porcine iliac endothelial (PIEC) cell line was cultured and tested by CCK-8 assay after nsPEFs treatment. The results reflected that nsPEFs with low field strength (100ns, 5 kV/cm, 10 pulses) had a significant proliferative effect with an increase in the PIEC cell growth of 16% after a 48 hour’ post-treatment. To further understand the mechanism of cell proliferation, intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration was measured through fluo-4 AM and reactive oxygen species assay was applied to estimate the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the total nitric oxide assay for NO production in the cultured medium was evaluated. An enhanced concentration of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and ROS were observed, while the concentration of extracellular NO also increased after nsPEFs treatment. Such experimental results demonstrated that nsPEFs with appropriate pulse parameters could effectively enhance cell proliferation on PIEC cells, and the cell proliferation associated strongly with the changes of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concertation, ROS and NO production induced by nsPEFs treatment.

The spread of antibiotic resistance is always a consequence of evolutionary processes. The consideration of evolution is thus key to the development of sustainable therapy. Two main factors were recently proposed to enhance long-term effectiveness of drug combinations: evolved collateral sensitivities between the drugs in a pair and antagonistic drug interactions. We systematically assessed these factors by performing over 1,600 evolution experiments with the opportunistic nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; in single- and multidrug environments. Based on the growth dynamics during these experiments, we reconstructed antibiotic combination efficacy (ACE) networks as a new tool for characterizing the ability of the tested drug combinations to constrain bacterial survival as well as drug resistance evolution across time. Subsequent statistical analysis of the influence of the factors on ACE network characteristics revealed that (i) synergistic drug interactions increased the likelihood of bacterial population extinction—irrespective of whether combinations were compared at the same level of inhibition or not—while (ii) the potential for evolved collateral sensitivities between 2 drugs accounted for a reduction in bacterial adaptation rates. In sum, our systematic experimental analysis allowed us to pinpoint 2 complementary determinants of combination efficacy and to identify specific drug pairs with high ACE scores. Our findings can guide attempts to further improve the sustainability of antibiotic therapy by simultaneously reducing pathogen load and resistance evolution.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YvqYr2rgaRA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525122000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004356</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Camilo Barbosa, Robert Beardmore, Hinrich Schulenburg, Gunther Jansen&lt;/p&gt;

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a catastrophic complication following total joint arthroplasty. Until now, the diagnosis of PJI is still confronted with difficulties, which is characterized by technical limitations. The question of whether sonication fluid PCR can provide high value in the diagnosis of PJI remains unanswered. This meta-analysis included 9 studies that evaluated PCR assays of sonication fluid for the diagnosis of PJI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, Positive likelihood ratio (PLR), Negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.81), 0.96 (CI, 0.94 to 0.97), 18.24 (CI, 6.07 to 54.78), 0.27 (CI, 0.20 to 0.36) and 86.97 (CI, 37.08 to 203.97), respectively. The AUC value of the SROC was 0.9244 (standard error, 0.0212). Subgroup analyses showed that use of multiplex PCR and may improve sensitivity and specificity. The results of this meta-analysis showed that PCR of fluid after sonication is reliable and of great value in PJI diagnosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Kan Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kan Liu, Jun Fu, Baozhan Yu, Wei Sun, Jiying Chen, Libo Hao&lt;/p&gt;
Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a catastrophic complication following total joint arthroplasty. Until now, the diagnosis of PJI is still confronted with difficulties, which is characterized by technical limitations. The question of whether sonication fluid PCR can provide high value in the diagnosis of PJI remains unanswered. This meta-analysis included 9 studies that evaluated PCR assays of sonication fluid for the diagnosis of PJI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, Positive likelihood ratio (PLR), Negative likelihood ratio (NLR) and Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.81), 0.96 (CI, 0.94 to 0.97), 18.24 (CI, 6.07 to 54.78), 0.27 (CI, 0.20 to 0.36) and 86.97 (CI, 37.08 to 203.97), respectively.

Understanding how knowledge is represented in the human brain is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. To date, most of the work on this topic has focused on knowledge representation in cortical areas and debated whether knowledge is represented in a distributed or localized fashion. Fang and colleagues provide evidence that brain connections and the white matter supporting such connections might play a significant role. The work opens new avenues of investigation, breaking through disciplinary boundaries across network neuroscience, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and classical lesion studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/YwDVYOi5evM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005758</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005758</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Franco Pestilli&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Many vaccines contain multiple components. Licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) contain polysaccharides from 7, 10, or 13 different serotypes of &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. The main outcomes in randomised trials of pneumococcal vaccines are serotype-specific antibody measures. Comparisons are made between groups for each serotype, resulting in multiple separate comparisons of treatment effects which can be complicated to interpret. We investigated methods for computing the overall difference between vaccine groups across all serotypes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal antibody concentrations were obtained from a randomised controlled trial of ten-valent pneumococcal vaccine, conducted in Kathmandu, Nepal. Infants received either 2 priming doses of vaccine at 6 and 14 weeks of age followed by a booster (2+1), or 3 priming doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age with no booster (3+0). The overall difference between vaccine schedules across all serotypes was computed at each visit using a multivariate linear model with equal weights for each serotype. Alternative weights were derived from invasive pneumococcal disease cases in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and from estimates of the relative invasiveness of each serotype and used in sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;When 10 separate estimates of treatment differences were computed the ratio of antibody responses for each serotype in the 2+1 group compared with the 3+0 group at 10 months of age varied greatly, with serotype-specific GMRs ranging from 2.80 for serotype 14, to 9.14 for serotype 18C. Using equal weights for each serotype, the overall geometric mean ratio (GMR) was 5.02 (95% CI 4.06−6.22) at 10 months of age, and 1.46 (95% CI 1.14−1.88) at 3 years of age. Using weights based on disease incidence gave GMRs ranging from 5.15 to 6.63 at 10 months of age, and 1.47 to 1.78 at 3 years of age. Using weights based on relative invasiveness gave estimates of 6.81 and 1.59, at 10 months and 3 years respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PCV clinical trial data have a multivariate structure with correlated outcomes for different serotypes. When analysing each serotype separately, the multiple estimates of the treatment effect can complicate the interpretation of trial results. Reporting a single overall estimate which accounts for the correlation between outcomes can simplify such interpretation. Treatment effects can be weighted equally or alternative weights derived from independent data can be used.Many modern vaccines have multiple components, such as quadrivalent meningococcal group ACWY vaccine or four-component group B meningococcal vaccine, thus these methods are widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Merryn Voysey</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Merryn Voysey, Andrew J.

Treatment effects can be weighted equally or alternative weights derived from independent data can be used.Many modern vaccines have multiple components, such as quadrivalent meningococcal group ACWY vaccine or four-component group B meningococcal vaccine, thus these methods are widely applicable.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196200</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196200</link><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196200</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196200</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>f1b461b5</fingerprint><title>[ASAP] Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Substrate Hydrophilicity and Confinement Effects in Capped Nafion Films</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b03257/20180523/images/medium/jp-2018-032575_0019.gif</url><height>215</height><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_16393586a4d:636058:f3bf0074</id><published>1527048000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b03257</href></item></canonical><author><name>Soumyadipta Sengupta, Alexey V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Cigarette smoking by pregnant women is associated with a significant increase in the risk for cognitive disorders in their children. Preclinical models confirm this risk by showing that exposure of the developing brain to nicotine produces adverse behavioral outcomes. Here we describe behavioral phenotypes resulting from perinatal nicotine exposure in a mouse model, and discuss our findings in the context of findings from previously published studies using preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure.&lt;/p&gt; Methodology/Principal findings &lt;p&gt;Female C57Bl/6 mice received drinking water containing nicotine (100μg/ml) + saccharin (2%) starting 3 weeks prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy, and until 3 weeks postpartum. Over the same period, female mice in two control groups received drinking water containing saccharin (2%) or plain drinking water. Offspring from each group were weaned at 3-weeks of age and subjected to behavioral analyses at 3 months of age. We examined spontaneous locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, spatial working memory, object based attention, recognition memory and impulsive-like behavior. We found significant deficits in attention and working memory only in male mice, and no significant changes in the other behavioral phenotypes in male or female mice. Exposure to saccharin alone did not produce significant changes in either sex.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion/Significance &lt;p&gt;The perinatal nicotine exposure produced significant deficits in attention and working memory in a sex-dependent manner in that the male but not female offspring displayed these behaviors. These behavioral phenotypes are associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and have been reported in other studies that used pre- or perinatal nicotine exposure. Therefore, we suggest that preclinical models of developmental nicotine exposure could be useful tools for modeling ADHD and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Lin Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lin Zhang, Thomas J.

Bdelloid rotifers are a class of microscopic invertebrates that have existed for millions of years apparently without sex or meiosis. They inhabit a variety of temporary and permanent freshwater habitats globally, and many species are remarkably tolerant of desiccation. Bdelloids offer an opportunity to better understand the evolution of sex and recombination, but previous work has emphasised desiccation as the cause of several unusual genomic features in this group. Here, we present high-quality whole-genome sequences of 3 bdelloid species: &lt;i&gt;Rotaria macrura&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;magnacalcarata&lt;/i&gt;, which are both desiccation intolerant, and &lt;i&gt;Adineta ricciae&lt;/i&gt;, which is desiccation tolerant. In combination with the published assembly of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt;, which is also desiccation tolerant, we apply a comparative genomics approach to evaluate the potential effects of desiccation tolerance and asexuality on genome evolution in bdelloids. We find that ancestral tetraploidy is conserved among all 4 bdelloid species, but homologous divergence in obligately aquatic &lt;i&gt;Rotaria&lt;/i&gt; genomes is unexpectedly low. This finding is contrary to current models regarding the role of desiccation in shaping bdelloid genomes. In addition, we find that homologous regions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ricciae&lt;/i&gt; are largely collinear and do not form palindromic repeats as observed in the published &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vaga&lt;/i&gt; assembly. Consequently, several features interpreted as genomic evidence for long-term ameiotic evolution are not general to all bdelloid species, even within the same genus. Finally, we substantiate previous findings of high levels of horizontally transferred nonmetazoan genes in both desiccating and nondesiccating bdelloid species and show that this unusual feature is not shared by other animal phyla, even those with desiccation-tolerant representatives. These comparisons call into question the proposed role of desiccation in mediating horizontal genetic transfer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y70C1gFZUSk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004830</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004830</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Reuben W.

Regulating membrane potential and synaptic function contributes significantly to the energetic costs of brain signaling, but the relative costs of action potentials (APs) and synaptic transmission during high-frequency firing are unknown. The continuous high-frequency (200-600Hz) electric organ discharge (EOD) of &lt;i&gt;Eigenmannia&lt;/i&gt;, a weakly electric fish, underlies its electrosensing and communication. EODs reflect APs fired by the muscle-derived electrocytes of the electric organ (EO). Cholinergic synapses at the excitable posterior membranes of the elongated electrocytes control AP frequency. Based on whole-fish O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption, ATP demand per EOD-linked AP increases exponentially with AP frequency. Continual EOD-AP generation implies first, that ion homeostatic processes reliably counteract any dissipation of posterior membrane E&lt;sub&gt;Na&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and second that high frequency synaptic activation is reliably supported. Both of these processes require energy. To facilitate an exploration of the expected energy demands of each, we modify a previous excitability model and include synaptic currents able to drive APs at frequencies as high as 600 Hz. Synaptic stimuli are modeled as pulsatile cation conductance changes, with or without a small (sustained) background conductance. Over the full species range of EOD frequencies (200–600 Hz) we calculate frequency-dependent “Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry budgets” for an electrocyte AP as a surrogate for required 3Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/2K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase activity. We find that the cost per AP of maintaining constant-amplitude APs increases nonlinearly with frequency, whereas the cost per AP for synaptic input current is essentially constant. This predicts that Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel density should correlate positively with EOD frequency, whereas AChR density should be the same across fish. Importantly, calculated costs (inferred from Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-entry through Nav and ACh channels) for electrocyte APs as frequencies rise are much less than expected from published whole-fish EOD-linked O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption.

Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease, with considerable genetic contribution. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified a number of genomic regions for the risk of psoriasis. However, it is challenging to pinpoint the functional causal variants and then further decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying each region. In order to prioritize potential functional causal variants within psoriasis susceptibility regions, we integrated the genetic association findings and functional genomic data publicly available, i.e. histone modifications in relevant immune cells. We characterized a pervasive enrichment pattern of psoriasis variants in five core histone marks across immune cells/tissues. We discovered that genetic alleles within psoriasis association regions might influence gene expression levels through significantly affecting the binding affinities of 17 transcription factors. We established a catalog of 654 potential functional causal variants for psoriasis and suggested that they significantly overlapped with causal variants for autoimmune diseases. We identified potential causal variant rs79824801 overlay with the peaks of five histone marks in primary CD4+ T cells. Its alternative allele affected the binding affinity of transcription factor &lt;i&gt;IKZF1&lt;/i&gt;. This study highlights the complex genetic architecture and complicated mechanisms for psoriasis.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526677200000</published><author><name>Beau Oldenburg</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency over space and time, affecting people’s health and burdening resource-constrained health systems. The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users’ recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user’s workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; borne viral diseases is under discussion.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;EWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><author><name>Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laith Hussain-Alkhateeb, Axel Kroeger, Piero Olliaro, Joacim Rocklöv, Maquins Odhiambo Sewe, Gustavo Tejeda, David Benitez, Balvinder Gill, S.

Background &lt;p&gt;In airway epithelium, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22) are induced by defective epithelial barriers such as E-cadherin and attract the effector cells of Th2 immunity. However, the association between the epithelial barrier and CCL17 expression has not been studied in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). Thus, we aimed to evaluate the expression of CCL17 and its regulation by Th cytokines in nasal polyp (NP) epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The expression and distribution of CCL17, CCL22, E-cadherin and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were measured using real-time PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry and compared between normal ethmoid sinus epithelium and NP epithelium. In addition, the expression level of CCL17 was determined in cultured epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The expression of CCL17 was decreased in the NP epithelium compared to the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus, whereas the expression of CCL22 was not decreased. E-cadherin was differentially distributed between the epithelium of normal ethmoid sinus and NP epithelium. EGFR was also decreased in NPs. Interestingly, the stimulation of cultured epithelial cells with Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, resulted in an upregulation of CCL17 expression only in NP epithelial cells whereas the expression of CCL17 was increased in both normal epithelial cells and NP epithelial cells by Th1 cytokines.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decreased expression of CCL17 in defective NP epithelium may be closely connected to NP pathogenesis and can be differentially regulated by cytokines in the NP epithelium of patients with CRSwNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Byoungjae Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byoungjae Kim, Hyun-Ji Lee, Nu-Ri Im, Doh Young Lee, Ha Kyun Kim, Cha Young Kang, Il-Ho Park, Seung Hoon Lee, Heung-Man Lee, Sang Hag Lee, Seung-Kuk Baek, Tae Hoon Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Huntington’s disease (HD) age of onset (AO) is mainly determined by the length of the CAG repeat expansion in the &lt;i&gt;huntingtin&lt;/i&gt; gene. The remaining AO variability has been attributed to other little-known factors. A factor that has been associated with other neurodegenerative diseases is arterial hypertension (AHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of AHT to the AO of HD. We used data from a cohort of 630 European HD patients with adult onset collected by the REGISTRY project of the European Huntington’s Disease Network. Multiple linear regression and ANOVA, controlling for the CAG repeat number of the expanded allele (CAGexp) of each patient, were performed to assess the association between the AHT condition and the AO of the motor symptoms (mAO). The results showed a significant association between AHT and mAO, especially when we only considered the patients diagnosed with AHT prior to manifesting any HD signs (pre-HD AHT). Remarkably, despite the low number of cases, those patients developed motor symptoms 5–8 years later than normotensive patients in the most frequent CAGexp range (40–44). AHT is an age-related condition and consequently, the age of the patient at the time of data collection could be a confounder variable. However, given that most pre-HD AHT patients included in our study had started treatment with antihypertensive drugs prior to the onset of HD, and that antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to confer a neuroprotective effect in other neurodegenerative diseases, raises the interest in elucidating the impact of AHT and/or AHT treatment in HD age of onset in further studies. A confirmation of our results in a larger sample set would open the possibility to significantly improve HD management.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><author><name>Leire Valcárcel-Ocete</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Leire Valcárcel-Ocete, Asier Fullaondo, Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu, María García-Barcina, Raymund A.

The objective of this paper is to fill a gap in the literature on internationalization, in relation to the absence of objective and measurable performance indicators for the process of how firms sequentially enter external markets. To that end, this research develops a quantitative tool for use as a performance indicator of gradualness for firms entering external markets at a sectoral level. The performance indicator is based on firms’ export volumes, number of years operating in the export market, geographic areas targeted for export and when exports began to each area. The indicator is tested empirically in the wine sector. The main contribution of this study is the creation of a reliable international priority index, which can serve more widely as a valuable tool because of its potential use in other industry sectors and geographic areas, and which would allow the analysis of how geographically differentiated internationalization strategies develop.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><author><name>Mónica Clavel San Emeterio</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mónica Clavel San Emeterio, Rubén Fernández-Ortiz, Jesús Arteaga-Ortiz, Pablo Dorta-González&lt;/p&gt;

Tether proteins attach the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other cellular membranes, thereby creating contact sites that are proposed to form platforms for regulating lipid homeostasis and facilitating non-vesicular lipid exchange. Sterols are synthesized in the ER and transported by non-vesicular mechanisms to the plasma membrane (PM), where they represent almost half of all PM lipids and contribute critically to the barrier function of the PM. To determine whether contact sites are important for both sterol exchange between the ER and PM and intermembrane regulation of lipid metabolism, we generated Δ-super-tether (Δ-s-tether) yeast cells that lack six previously identified tethering proteins (yeast extended synatotagmin [E-Syt], vesicle-associated membrane protein [VAMP]-associated protein [VAP], and TMEM16-anoctamin homologues) as well as the presumptive tether Ice2. Despite the lack of ER-PM contacts in these cells, ER-PM sterol exchange is robust, indicating that the sterol transport machinery is either absent from or not uniquely located at contact sites. Unexpectedly, we found that the transport of exogenously supplied sterol to the ER occurs more slowly in Δ-s-tether cells than in wild-type (WT) cells. We pinpointed this defect to changes in sterol organization and transbilayer movement within the PM bilayer caused by phospholipid dysregulation, evinced by changes in the abundance and organization of PM lipids. Indeed, deletion of either &lt;i&gt;OSH4&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a sterol/phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) exchange protein, or &lt;i&gt;SAC1&lt;/i&gt;, which encodes a PI4P phosphatase, caused synthetic lethality in Δ-s-tether cells due to disruptions in redundant PI4P and phospholipid regulatory pathways. The growth defect of Δ-s-tether cells was rescued with an artificial &amp;quot;ER-PM staple,&amp;quot; a tether assembled from unrelated non-yeast protein domains, indicating that endogenous tether proteins have nonspecific bridging functions. Finally, we discovered that sterols play a role in regulating ER-PM contact site formation. In sterol-depleted cells, levels of the yeast E-Syt tether Tcb3 were induced and ER-PM contact increased dramatically. These results support a model in which ER-PM contact sites provide a nexus for coordinating the complex interrelationship between sterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids that maintain PM composition and integrity.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OHq9avpWuLk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526936400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003864</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003864</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Evan Quon, Yves Y.

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Dye-less chromoendoscopy is an emerging technology for colorectal polyp characterization. Herein, we investigated whether the newly introduced I-scan optical enhancement (OE) can accurately predict polyp histology &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective three-phased study, 84 patients with 230 diminutive colorectal polyps were included. During the first two study phases, five endoscopists assessed whether analysis of polyp colour, surface and vascular pattern under i-scan OE can differentiate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; between adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps. Finally, junior and experienced endoscopists (JE, EE, each n = 4) not involved in the prior study phases made a post hoc diagnosis of polyp histology using a static i-scan OE image database. Histopathology was used as a gold-standard in all study phases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall accuracy of i-scan OE for histology prediction was 90% with a sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative prediction value (NPV) of 91%, 90%, 86% and 94%, respectively. In high confidence predictions, the diagnostic accuracy increased to 93% with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 94%, 91%, 89% and 96%. Colonoscopy surveillance intervals were predicted correctly in ≥ 90% of patients. In the post hoc analysis EE predicted polyp histology under i-scan OE with an overall accuracy of 91%. After a single training session, JE achieved a comparable diagnostic performance for predicting polyp histology with i-scan OE.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The histology of diminutive colorectal polyps can be accurately predicted with i-scan OE &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in real-time.

However, computational identification of lncRNAs in a wide range of species remains challenging; it requires prior knowledge of well-established sequences and annotations or species-specific training data, but the reality is that only a limited number of species have high-quality sequences and annotations. Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs.

Here we first characterize lncRNAs by contrast to protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship and find that the feature relationship between ORF (open reading frame) length and GC content presents universally substantial divergence in lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs, as observed in a broad variety of species. Based on the feature relationship, accordingly, we further present LGC, a novel algorithm for identifying lncRNAs that is able to accurately distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs in a cross-species manner without any prior knowledge. As validated on large-scale empirical datasets, comparative results show that LGC outperforms existing algorithms by achieving higher accuracy, well-balanced sensitivity and specificity, and is robustly effective (&gt;90% accuracy) in discriminating lncRNAs from protein-coding RNAs across diverse species that range from plants to mammals. To our knowledge, this study, for the first time, differentially characterizes lncRNAs and protein-coding RNAs based on feature relationship, which is further applied in computational identification of lncRNAs. Taken together, our study represents a significant advance in characterization and identification of lncRNAs and LGC thus bears broad potential utility for computational analysis of lncRNAs in a wide range of species.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/327882</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1527098471742</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/327882v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>3b307abd</fingerprint><title>Melissa: Bayesian clustering and imputation of single cell methylomes [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1631c34ff43:26810d1:fc1f8953</id><content><content>Measurements of DNA methylation at the single cell level are promising to revolutionise our understanding of epigenetic control of gene expression.

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526504400000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Studies on &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; would benefit from the introduction of new selectable markers to allow more complex types of experiments to be conducted with this model animal. We established a new antibiotic selection marker for &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; transformation based on nourseothricin (NTC) and its resistance-encoding gene, streptothricin-acetyl transferase 2 (&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt;). NTC was able to efficiently prevent worm development at very low concentrations, and the worms expressing &lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; were able to survive on the selection plates without any developmental defects. Using CRISPR/Cas9 and NTC selection, we were able to easily insert a 13-kb expression cassette into a defined locus in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The structure and spectrum of NTC differs from other antibiotics like hygromycin B and geneticin, making it possible to use NTC alongside them. Indeed, we confirmed NTC-&lt;i&gt;sat2&lt;/i&gt; selection could work with the hygromycin B selection system simultaneously. Thus, the new NTC–&lt;i&gt;Sat2&lt;/i&gt; system can act as a useful dominant marker for gene transfer and genome editing in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Hiroyuki Obinata</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hiroyuki Obinata, Asako Sugimoto, Shinsuke Niwa&lt;/p&gt;

HIV acquisition during pregnancy and breastfeeding significantly contributes toward paediatric HIV infection; however, little is known about risk behaviours in HIV-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women. We conducted twenty-six in-depth-interviews between July and December 2016 using a semi-structured interview guide among HIV-uninfected pregnant and recently postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition (defined as reporting ≥1 of the following: partner’s serostatus unknown or HIV-infected, recent condomless sex in pregnancy, and/or alcohol use during pregnancy) who attended primary healthcare services. Our study contextualizes factors related to risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy and postpartum periods and assesses knowledge and hypothetical acceptability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy. Translated and transcribed data were coded and analysed by three researchers using a thematic analysis approach. In interviews with HIV-uninfected pregnant/postpartum women at-risk of HIV acquisition, we identified common themes associated with sexual risk behaviours during pregnancy, including: lack of control over decisions in sex and condom use in pregnancy, low perceived risk (e.g. beliefs that their partner has the same HIV-negative serostatus), and socio-cultural beliefs around condom use during pregnancy (e.g. contact with sperm is essential for baby’s development). PrEP knowledge was low among HIV-uninfected pregnant and breastfeeding women, and potential acceptability was good, though primary concerns were around the potential impact on the infant. While mothers presented a clear desire to protect themselves from HIV acquisition once pregnant, they also reported lack of control, and socio-cultural beliefs, like sex is good for the baby, that increased their risk of seroconversion. Mothers had limited PrEP awareness but reported hypothetical willingness to use PrEP because of concerns over HIV acquisition and onward mother to child transmission.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><author><name>Dvora Joseph Davey</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dvora Joseph Davey, Elise Farley, Catriona Towriss, Yolanda Gomba, Linda-Gail Bekker, Pamina Gorbach, Steven Shoptaw, Thomas Coates, Landon Myer&lt;/p&gt;

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><author><name>Jason G.

The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a main regulator of cell survival, proliferation, motility, and platelet aggregation, and it is essential for angiogenesis and lymphocyte trafficking. In that S1P acts as a second messenger intra- and extracellularly, it might promote cancer progression. The main cause is found in the high S1P concentration in the blood, which encourage cancer cells to migrate through the endothelial barrier into the blood vessels. The irreversible degradation of S1P is solely caused by the sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1). SGPL1 overexpression reduces cancer cell migration and therefore silences the endogenous S1P siren, which promotes cancer cell attraction—the main reason for metastasis. Since our previous metabolomics studies revealed an increased SGPL1 activity in association with successful breast cancer cell treatment &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, we further investigated expression and localization of SGPL1. Expression analyses confirmed a very low SGPL1 expression in all breast cancer samples, regardless of their subtype. Additionally, we were able to prove a novel SGPL expression in the cytoplasm membrane of non-tumorigenic breast cells by fusing three independent methods. The general SGPL1 downregulation and the loss of the plasma membrane expression resulted in S1P dependent stimulation of migration in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-20. Not only S1P stimulated migration could be repressed by overexpressing the natural SGPL1 variant not but also more general migratory activity was significantly reduced. Here, for the first time, we report on the SGPL1 plasma membrane location in human, non-malignant breast epithelial cell lines silencing the extracellular S1P siren &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and thereby regulating pivotal cellular functions. Loss of this plasma membrane distribution as well as low SGPL1 expression levels could be a potential prognostic marker and a viable target for therapy. Therefore, the precise role of SGPL1 for cancer treatment should be evaluated.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><author><name>Nadja Engel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nadja Engel, Anna Adamus, Marcus Frank, Karin Kraft, Juliane Kühn, Petra Müller, Barbara Nebe, Annika Kasten, Guido Seitz&lt;/p&gt;

These results suggest a physiological mechanism by which external cues control mitochondrial homeostasis in thermogenic fat cells through mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://stke.sciencemag.org/content/11/527/eaap8526.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaap8526?rss=1</link><crawled>1524594130919</crawled><originId>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaap8526?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/11/527/eaap8526?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>ec3a1a49</fingerprint><title>Optimized application of the secreted Nano-luciferase reporter system using an affinity purification strategy</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525294800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a180:93d646dc</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;
Secreted Nano-luciferase (secNluc) is a newly engineered secreted luciferase that possesses advantages of high structural stability, long half-life, and glow-type kinetics together with high light emission intensity, and thus would become one of the most valuable tools for bioluminescence assays. However, like other secreted luciferases, secNluc has to mix with the components in the conditioned medium surrounding test cells, or in the biological samples such as blood or urine after being secreted. These components may interfere with secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions and thus limit the application of the secNluc reporter system. In this study, we first examined the effects of three factors, pH, serum and residual reagents, on secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions, finding that these factors could interfere with bioluminescence reactions and result in background signal. To resolve these problems, we applied a simple affinity purification strategy in which secNluc was fused with a FLAG-tag, and anti-FLAG magnetic beads were used to catch and transfer the fusion protein to PBST, an optimal buffer for secNluc-catalyzed bioluminescence reactions that was identified in this study. The results indicated that this strategy could not only negate the interferences from serum or residual reagents and enhance the stability of light emission but also greatly increase signal intensity through enzyme enrichment. This strategy may contribute to biomedical studies that utilize secNluc and other secreted luciferases, especially those requiring superior sensitivity, low background noise and high reproducibility.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><author><name>JingZhe Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by JingZhe Li, ZhiLan Guo, Takashi Sato, Bo Yuan, YanYan Ma, Dan Qian, JuYing Zhong, MengMeng Jin, Peng Huang, LuYang Che, Yi Wang, Yan Lei, ChangZhen Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><author><name>Rivka R.

Active learning is a pedagogical approach that involves students engaging in collaborative learning, which enables them to take more responsibility for their learning and improve their critical thinking skills. While prior research examined student performance at majority universities, this study focuses on specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the first time. Here we present work that focuses on the impact of active learning interventions at Florida A&amp;amp;M University, where we measured the impact of active learning strategies coupled with a SCALE-UP (Student Centered Active Learning Environment with Upside-down Pedagogies) learning environment on student success in General Biology. In biology sections where active learning techniques were employed, students watched online videos and completed specific activities before class covering information previously presented in a traditional lecture format. In-class activities were then carefully planned to reinforce critical concepts and enhance critical thinking skills through active learning techniques such as the one-minute paper, think-pair-share, and the utilization of clickers. Students in the active learning and control groups covered the same topics, took the same summative examinations and completed identical homework sets. In addition, the same instructor taught all of the sections included in this study. Testing demonstrated that these interventions increased learning gains by as much as 16%, and students reported an increase in their positive perceptions of active learning and biology. Overall, our results suggest that active learning approaches coupled with the SCALE-UP environment may provide an added opportunity for student success when compared with the standard modes of instruction in General Biology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Gokhan Hacisalihoglu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gokhan Hacisalihoglu, Desmond Stephens, Lewis Johnson, Maurice Edington&lt;/p&gt;

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Lucia Bizovska</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucia Bizovska, Zdenek Svoboda, Miroslav Janura, Maria Cristina Bisi, Nicolas Vuillerme&lt;/p&gt;

While many tropical countries are experiencing rapid deforestation, some have experienced forest transition (FT) from net deforestation to net reforestation. Numerous studies have identified causative factors of FT, among which forest scarcity has been considered as a prerequisite for FT. In fact, in SE Asia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, which experienced FT since 1990, exhibited a lower remaining forest area (30±8%) than the other five countries (68±6%, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar) where forest loss continues. In this study, we examined 1) the factors associated with forest scarcity, 2) the proximate and/or underlying factors that have driven forest area change, and 3) whether causative factors changed across FT phases (from deforestation to net forest gain) during 1980–2010 in the eight SE Asian countries. We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526418000000</published><author><name>Nobuo Imai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nobuo Imai, Takuya Furukawa, Riyou Tsujino, Shumpei Kitamura, Takakazu Yumoto&lt;/p&gt;

We used production of wood, food, and export-oriented food commodities as proximate causes and demographic, social, economic and environmental factors, as well as land-use efficiency, and wood and food trade as underlying causes that affect forest area change. Remaining forest area in 1990 was negatively correlated with population density and potential land area of lowland forests, while positively correlated with per capita wood production. This implies that countries rich in accessible and productive forests, and higher population pressures are the ones that have experienced forest scarcity, and eventually FT. Food production and agricultural input were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with forest area change during 1980–2009. This indicates that more food production drives deforestation, but higher efficiency of agriculture is correlated with forest gain. We also found a U-shaped response of forest area change to social openness, suggesting that forest gain can be achieved in both open and closed countries, but deforestation might be accelerated in countries undergoing societal transition. These results indicate the importance of environmental, agricultural and social variables on forest area dynamics, and have important implications for predicting future tropical forest change.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197391</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>448fb8e2</fingerprint><title>Megakaryocyte lineage development is controlled by modulation of protein acetylation</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1524776400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163030f0d1c:3bae6e:fc1f8953</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Marije Bartels, Anita Govers, Roel Polak, Stephin Vervoort, Ruben van Boxtel, Cornelieke Pals, Marc Bierings, Wouter van Solinge, Toine Egberts, Edward Nieuwenhuis, Michal Mokry, Paul James Coffer&lt;/p&gt;

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multi-protein complexes in a number of bacterial pathogens that can translocate proteins and DNA to the host. Most T4SSs function in conjugation and translocate DNA; however, approximately 13% function to secrete proteins, delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells. Upon entry, these effectors manipulate the host cell’s machinery for their own benefit, which can result in serious illness or death of the host. For this reason recognition of T4SS effectors has become an important subject. Much previous work has focused on verifying effectors experimentally, a costly endeavor in terms of money, time, and effort. Having good predictions for effectors will help to focus experimental validations and decrease testing costs. In recent years, several scoring and machine learning-based methods have been suggested for the purpose of predicting T4SS effector proteins. These methods have used different sets of features for prediction, and their predictions have been inconsistent. In this paper, an optimal set of features is presented for predicting T4SS effector proteins using a statistical approach. A thorough literature search was performed to find features that have been proposed. Feature values were calculated for datasets of known effectors and non-effectors for T4SS-containing pathogens for four genera with a sufficient number of known effectors, &lt;i&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Coxiella burnetii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp, and &lt;i&gt;Bartonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. The features were ranked, and less important features were filtered out. Correlations between remaining features were removed, and dimensional reduction was accomplished using principal component analysis and factor analysis. Finally, the optimal features for each pathogen were chosen by building logistic regression models and evaluating each model. The results based on evaluation of our logistic regression models confirm the effectiveness of our four optimal sets of features, and based on these an optimal set of features is proposed for all T4SS effector proteins.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Zhila Esna Ashari</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhila Esna Ashari, Nairanjana Dasgupta, Kelly A.

d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor.

d-Tagatose has gained substantial interest due to its potential functionalities as a sucrose substitute. In this study, the gene &lt;i&gt;araA&lt;/i&gt;, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) from &lt;i&gt;Clostridium hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; (DSM 15053), was cloned and expressed in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; BL21 (DE3). This gene consists of 1,506 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 501 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 56,554 Da. Since l-AI was expressed as an intracellular inclusion body, this enzyme was solubilized with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and activated with a descending concentration gradient of urea. The purified enzyme exhibited the greatest activity at 50°C, pH 7–7.5, and required 1 mM of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor. Notably, the catalytic efficiency (3.69 mM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) of l-AI from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; on galactose was significantly greater than that of other previously reported enzymes. The bioconversion yield of d-tagatose using the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; l-arabinose isomerase at 60°C reached approximately 46% from 10 mM of d-galactose after 2 h. From these results, it is suggested that the l-arabinose isomerase from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hylemonae&lt;/i&gt; could be utilized as a potential enzyme for d-tagatose production due to its high conversion yield at an industrially competitive temperature.</description><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</link><crawled>1524505145782</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196099</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>8794178f</fingerprint><crawled>1525356704662</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16326583396:d18b16:93d646dc</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32911</originId><published>1525305600000</published><title>Distinct ‘safe zones’ at the nuclear envelope ensure robust replication of heterochromatic chromosome regions</title><description>Chromosome replication and transcription occur within a complex nuclear milieu whose functional subdomains are beginning to be mapped out.

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates.

AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials).

How will coastal soils in areas newly flooded with seawater function as habitat for benthic marine organisms? This research question is highly relevant as global sea level rise and coastal realignment will cause flooding of soils and form new marine habitats. In this study, we tested experimentally the capacity of common marine polychaetes, &lt;i&gt;Marenzelleria viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scoloplos armiger&lt;/i&gt; to colonize and modify the biogeochemistry of the newly established Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon, Denmark.

How will coastal soils in areas newly flooded with seawater function as habitat for benthic marine organisms? This research question is highly relevant as global sea level rise and coastal realignment will cause flooding of soils and form new marine habitats. In this study, we tested experimentally the capacity of common marine polychaetes, &lt;i&gt;Marenzelleria viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nereis (Hediste) diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scoloplos armiger&lt;/i&gt; to colonize and modify the biogeochemistry of the newly established Gyldensteen Coastal Lagoon, Denmark. All tested polychaetes survived relatively well (28–89%) and stimulated carbon dioxide release (TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by 97–105% when transferred to newly flooded soils, suggesting that soil characteristics are modified rapidly by colonizing fauna. A field survey showed that the pioneering benthic community inside the lagoon was structurally different from the marine area outside the lagoon, and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;viridis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;armiger&lt;/i&gt; were not among the early colonizers. These were instead &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Polydora cornuta&lt;/i&gt; with an abundance of 1603 and 540 ind m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Considering the species-specific effects of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;diversicolor&lt;/i&gt; on TCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release and its average abundance in the lagoon, we estimate that organic carbon degradation was increased by 219% in the first year of flooding. We therefore conclude that early colonizing polychaetes modify the soils and may play an important role in the ecological and successional developments, e.g. C cycling and biodiversity, in newly flooded coastal ecosystems.

These reactions have a lot of variables in them and can be notoriously finicky about what combination of these will actually give decent amounts of product. At the same time, it appears that almost any given metal-catalyzed coupling reaction is capable of being optimized, if you care enough. So this is a good field for both miniaturized reaction searching (as in the link above) and for machine learning (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going after what’s often an even more challenging case, the C-N &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchwald%E2%80%93Hartwig_amination&quot;&gt;Buchwald-Hartwig&lt;/a&gt; coupling. That one gets used a lot in medicinal chemistry (we like nitrogen atoms), but it’s also a well-known beast when it comes to variation in yield. You can honestly never be quite sure that it’s going to work well when you set it up on a new system for the first time, because there are a lot of conditions (solvent, catalyst, additives) to pick from, and often very little guidance about which region of reaction space is going to be most fruitful. This work, a Princeton/Merck collaboration, is an attempt to calculate a way out of the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the two approaches mentioned in the first paragraph are not an either/or case. Far from it. If you’re going to do machine learning, you’re going to need a lot of reliable data (positive and negative) to feed into the model, and how better to generate that than in an automated, high-throughput setup? That’s especially true as you start adding in more reaction variables: every one of those can increase the complexity of the machine learning model in an exponential fashion, and stuff gets out of control quickly under those conditions. So the question is, can ML provide something useful here, and can it outperform the simpler-to-implement regression models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d definitely want robotic help up front: the data set was the yields from 4,608 coupling reactions  (15 aryl or heteroaryl halides, 4 ligands, 3 bases, and 23 isoxazole additives). About 30% of the reactions gave no product at all – valuable fodder for the model – and the rest were spread in a wide range from “pretty darn good” to “truly crappy”. Just what you need. At this point, you need to figure out just what you’re going to tell the system about these reactions (a nontrivial decision). Too few (or wrongly chosen) parameters, and you’ll never get a useful model. Too many, and you risk an overfitted model that looks good from a distance but is both hard to implement and still not robust. In this case, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_(software)&quot;&gt;Spartan&lt;/a&gt; program &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/02/14/science.aar5169.DC1/aar5169-Ahenman-SM_revision_1.pdf&quot;&gt;is used to provide&lt;/a&gt; atomic, molecular, and vibrational descriptors of the substrate(s), catalysts, bases, and additives. So what goes in are electrostatics at various atoms, vibrational modes (frequencies and intensities), dipole moments, electronegativity, surface areas, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the team took 70% of the data as a training set to see if they could predict the outcomes in the other 30%, and ran the data through a whole set of possibilities: linear and polynomial regression for starters, then k-nearest neighbors, Bayes-generalized linear models, layered neural networks, random-forest techniques, etc. Only when they got to that last two did they start to see real predictive value, and random-forest seems to have been the clear winner. Its predictions, even using only 5% of the data, were better than linear-regression models tuned up on the whole 70%. But even so, there were limits. “Activity cliffs” are always a problem in these reactions, and those are hard to pick up (even with 4,608 reactions to train on!) The wider the range of chemical/reaction space you’re trying to cover with your model, the better the chance you’re going to miss these things (and the better the chance you’re going to end up with an overfitted model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way out of that is to restrict your question to a narrower region of potential reactions (and thus get more fine detail into the model). But that, naturally, makes it less useful: after all, the dream is a Buchwald-Hartwig Box, where you walk up, draw the structures of your two reactants (no matter what they might be), and it pauses for a moment and spits out a set of good reaction conditions. That’s. . .still a little ways off. But I do have to say that this current effort beats both human intuition (insofar as anyone has any about these reactions) and other attempts to calculate likely starting points. So it is a real improvement, and the finding that random-forest techniques outperformed everything else is worth building on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group did try putting in some additives that were not in the training set at all, to see how the model would handle them. And the answer is “not bad”: the root-mean-square error in predicted yields for the original test set versus reference set was about 8%, and the RMSE for the new additive set was about 11%. So it was not quite as good, but on the right track. (By comparison, the single-layer neural network model had about a 10% error on the original set, while the other methods came in at 15 to 16%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggested a look at the final random-forest procedure to see if there was anything that could be learned about the mechanism (a tall order, from what I know about the field). Some of the most important descriptors were things like electrostatic charge on the isoxazole additive’s atoms, its calculated LUMO, and its carbon NMR shifts. That suggests that the additive’s electrophilic behavior was important, but those parameters taken by themselves weren’t enough to produce any kind of useful model on their own. Still, a check of isoxazoles from both ends of the scale suggested that the more electrophilic ones were capable of undergoing a side reaction with the Pd catalyst that reduced yields, which may well be what the model was picking up on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I’d say that this paper does show (as have some others) that machine-learning techniques are going to help us out eventually in predicting reaction conditions, even if that day has not quite arrived. When you get down to it, the parameters going into this model are not particularly complicated, so it may well be a good sign that it’s worked as well as it has. You’d have to think that larger data sets and new inputs can only going to make these things perform better (after plenty of human effort and care, of course), and that’s leaving aside the general possibility of improved algorithms. I think we’ll get there, but we’re not there now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13488</originId><published>1524660632000</published><title>Calculate Your Way Out of Bad Yields</title><description>I wrote a little while back about a brute-force approach to finding metal-catalyzed coupling conditions.

Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0–150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526418000000</published><author><name>Youjia Du</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youjia Du, Carla G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Vascular calcification is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease. However, no viable treatments for this condition have been identified. This study aimed to determine whether farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) can reduce vascular calcification and the mechanism by which this reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that FTI-277 significantly inhibits phosphate-induced mineral deposition by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, prevents VSMC osteogenic differentiation, and increases mRNA expression of matrix Gla protein (MGP), an inhibitor of mineralization. FTI-277 increases Akt signaling in VSMC in short-term serum-stimulation assays and in long-term mineralization assays. In contrast, manumycin A has no effect on Akt signaling or mineralization. Co-incubation of VSMC with FTI-277 and SH6 (an Akt inhibitor) significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of FTI-277 on mineralization, demonstrating that FTI-277 inhibits calcification by activating Akt signaling. Over-expression of the constitutively active p110 sub-unit of PI3K in VSMC using adenovirus activates Akt, inhibits mineralization, suppresses VSMC differentiation and significantly enhances MGP mRNA expression. FTI-277 also inhibits phosphate-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of VSMC, and these effects are negated by co-incubation with SH6. Finally, using an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; model of vascular calcification, we demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits high phosphate-induced mineralization in aortic rings derived from rats with end-stage renal failure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Together, these results demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits VSMC mineral deposition by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that targeting farnesylation, or Akt specifically, may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><author><name>Arvind Ponnusamy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arvind Ponnusamy, Smeeta Sinha, Gareth D.

FTI-277 also inhibits phosphate-induced activation of caspase 3 and apoptosis of VSMC, and these effects are negated by co-incubation with SH6. Finally, using an &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; model of vascular calcification, we demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits high phosphate-induced mineralization in aortic rings derived from rats with end-stage renal failure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Together, these results demonstrate that FTI-277 inhibits VSMC mineral deposition by up-regulating PI3K/Akt signaling and preventing apoptosis, suggesting that targeting farnesylation, or Akt specifically, may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of vascular calcification.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</link><crawled>1524591550687</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196232</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>d64ca969</fingerprint><title>Tunable on-chip optical beam splitter</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395b3:3dd877af</id><published>1526578752000</published><author><name>Osborne, I.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Cuiying Song</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

The applicability of this EDF library is demonstrated by the analyses of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and other real space functions on HeCuF, , OgF4, and TlCl3(DMSO)2.

Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP-7) is a multigene family expressed during malaria blood-stage infection. MSP-7 forms complex with MSP-1 prior to merozoite egress from erythrocytes, and could affect merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. To characterize sequence variation in the orthologue in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; (PvMSP-7), a gene member encoding PvMSP-7E was analyzed among 92 Thai isolates collected from 3 major endemic areas of Thailand (Northwest: Tak, Northeast: Ubon Ratchathani, and South: Yala and Narathiwat provinces). In total, 52 distinct haplotypes were found to circulate in these areas. Although population structure based on this locus was observed between each endemic area, no genetic differentiation occurred between populations collected from different periods in the same endemic area, suggesting spatial but not temporal genetic variation. Sequence microheterogeneity in both N- and C- terminal regions was predicted to display 4 and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. Signals of purifying selection were observed in α-helices II-X, suggesting structural or functional constraint in these domains. By contrast, α-helix-I spanning the putative signal peptide was under positive selection, in which amino acid substitutions could alter predicted CD4+ T helper cell epitopes. The central region of &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; comprised the 5’-trimorphic and the 3’-dimorphic subregions. Positive selection was identified in the 3’ dimorphic subregion of the central domain. A consensus of intrinsically unstructured or disordered protein was predicted to encompass the entire central domain that contained a number of putative B cell epitopes and putative protein binding regions. Evidences of intragenic recombination were more common in the central region than the remainders of the gene. These results suggest that the extent of sequence variation, recombination events and selective pressures in the &lt;i&gt;PvMSP-7E&lt;/i&gt; locus seem to be differentially affected by protein secondary structure.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><author><name>Chew Weng Cheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chew Weng Cheng, Chaturong Putaporntip, Somchai Jongwutiwes&lt;/p&gt;

Several brain diseases are characterized by abnormally strong neuronal synchrony. Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation was computationally designed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchronization processes by desynchronization. In the presence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) this may lead to a decrease of synaptic excitatory weights and ultimately to an anti-kindling, i.e. unlearning of abnormal synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. The long-lasting desynchronizing impact of CR stimulation has been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. However, as yet it is unclear how to optimally choose the CR stimulation frequency, i.e. the repetition rate at which the CR stimuli are delivered. This work presents the first computational study on the dependence of the acute and long-term outcome on the CR stimulation frequency in neuronal networks with STDP. For this purpose, CR stimulation was applied with Rapidly Varying Sequences (RVS) as well as with Slowly Varying Sequences (SVS) in a wide range of stimulation frequencies and intensities. Our findings demonstrate that acute desynchronization, achieved during stimulation, does not necessarily lead to long-term desynchronization after cessation of stimulation. By comparing the long-term effects of the two different CR protocols, the RVS CR stimulation turned out to be more robust against variations of the stimulation frequency. However, SVS CR stimulation can obtain stronger anti-kindling effects. We revealed specific parameter ranges that are favorable for long-term desynchronization. For instance, RVS CR stimulation at weak intensities and with stimulation frequencies in the range of the neuronal firing rates turned out to be effective and robust, in particular, if no closed loop adaptation of stimulation parameters is (technically) available. From a clinical standpoint, this may be relevant in the context of both invasive as well as non-invasive CR stimulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rx9Yjw7JXhk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006113</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Thanos Manos, Magteld Zeitler, Peter A.

Then, we propose a simple nearest neighbor model (Ising model) to understand the statistical variations in human miRNAs.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/10/319301</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319301v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1525962759285</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319301v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319301v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>6383ce2b</fingerprint><title>Genome-wide analysis of the NAC transcription factor family and their expression during the development and ripening of the &amp;lt;i&gt;Fragaria&amp;lt;/i&gt; × &amp;lt;i&gt;ananassa&amp;lt;/i&gt; fruits</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525381200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3af4:5785ab88</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

NAC proteins are a family of transcription factors which have a variety of important regulatory roles in plants. They present a very well conserved group of NAC subdomains in the N-terminal region and a highly variable domain at the C-terminus. Currently, knowledge concerning NAC family in the strawberry plant remains very limited. In this work, we analyzed the NAC family of &lt;i&gt;Fragaria vesca&lt;/i&gt;, and a total of 112 NAC proteins were identified after we curated the annotations from the version 4.0.a1 genome. They were placed into the ligation groups (pseudo-chromosomes) and described its physicochemical and genetic features. A microarray transcriptomic analysis showed six of them expressed during the development and ripening of the &lt;i&gt;Fragaria&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;ananassa&lt;/i&gt; fruit. Their expression patterns were studied in fruit (receptacle and achenes) in different stages of development and in vegetative tissues. Also, the expression level under different hormonal treatments (auxins, ABA) and drought stress was investigated. In addition, they were clustered with other NAC transcription factor with known function related to growth and development, senescence, fruit ripening, stress response, and secondary cell wall and vascular development. Our results indicate that these six strawberry NAC proteins could play different important regulatory roles in the process of development and ripening of the fruit, providing the basis for further functional studies and the selection for NAC candidates suitable for biotechnological applications.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><author><name>Enriqueta Moyano</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enriqueta Moyano, Félix J.

Thiols can be deprotonated to form a thiolate, which affords a diverse range of enzymatic activity and modes for chemical modification of proteins.

The cysteine thiolate model in the Amber force field underestimates the thiolate radius by 0.2 Å and overestimates the thiolate hydration energy by 119 kJ/mol because it uses the same Lennard-Jones parameters for thiolates as for thiols.

MiRNA molecules are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in the brain function. Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><author><name>Sayuri Higaki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sayuri Higaki, Masashi Muramatsu, Akio Matsuda, Kenji Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Satoh, Makoto Michikawa, Shumpei Niida&lt;/p&gt;

Neither the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation nor the point mutations influenced the development of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; block, suggesting that the conformational changes of the bundle crossing region do not contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent gating of TRESK.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197622</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>41eb4594</fingerprint><title>A novel early risk assessment tool for detecting clinical outcomes in patients with heat-related illness (J-ERATO score): Development and validation in independent cohorts in Japan</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525899600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bedb:2835af05</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kei Hayashida, Yutaka Kondo, Toru Hifumi, Junya Shimazaki, Yasutaka Oda, Shinichiro Shiraishi, Tatsuma Fukuda, Junichi Sasaki, Keiki Shimizu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;We sought to develop a novel risk assessment tool to predict the clinical outcomes after heat-related illness.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Prospective, multicenter observational study. Patients who transferred to emergency hospitals in Japan with heat-related illness were registered. The sample was divided into two parts: 60% to construct the score and 40% to validate it. A binary logistic regression model was used to predict hospital admission as a primary outcome. The resulting model was transformed into a scoring system.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 3,001 eligible patients were analyzed. There was no difference in variables between development and validation cohorts. Based on the result of a logistic regression model in the development phase (n = 1,805), the J-ERATO score was defined as the sum of the six binary components in the prehospital setting (respiratory rate≥22 /min, Glasgow coma scale&amp;lt;15, systolic blood pressure≤100 mmHg, heart rate≥100 bpm, body temperature≥38°C, and age≥65 y), for a total score ranging from 0 to 6. In the validation phase (n = 1,196), the score had excellent discrimination (C-statistic 0.84; 95% CI 0.79–0.89, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and calibration (P&gt;0.2 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The observed proportion of hospital admission increased with increasing J-ERATO score (score = 0, 5.0%; score = 1, 15.0%; score = 2, 24.6%; score = 3, 38.6%; score = 4, 68.0%; score = 5, 85.2%; score = 6, 96.4%). Multivariate analyses showed that the J-ERATO score was an independent positive predictor of hospital admission (adjusted OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.06–2.87; P&amp;lt;0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3.73; 2.95–4.72; P&amp;lt;0.001) and in-hospital mortality (1.65; 1.18–2.32; P = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The J-ERATO score is simply assessed and can facilitate the identification of patients with higher risk of heat-related hospitalization.

This progress has also created unprecedented challenges for individual labs to store, manage and analyze proteomics data, both in the cost for proprietary software and high-performance computing, and the long processing time that discourages on-the-fly changes of data processing settings required in explorative and discovery analysis. We developed an open-source, cloud computing-based pipeline, MS-PyCloud, with graphical user interface (GUI) support, for LC-MS/MS data analysis.

This progress has also created unprecedented challenges for individual labs to store, manage and analyze proteomics data, both in the cost for proprietary software and high-performance computing, and the long processing time that discourages on-the-fly changes of data processing settings required in explorative and discovery analysis. We developed an open-source, cloud computing-based pipeline, MS-PyCloud, with graphical user interface (GUI) support, for LC-MS/MS data analysis.

Treatment of prosthetic joint infections often involves multiple surgeries and prolonged antibiotic administration, resulting in a significant burden to patients and the healthcare system. We are exploring a non-invasive method to eradicate biofilm on metal implants utilizing high-frequency alternating magnetic fields (AMF) which can achieve surface induction heating. Although proof-of-concept studies demonstrate the ability of AMF to eradicate biofilm in vitro, there is a legitimate safety concern related to the potential for thermal damage to surrounding tissues when considering heating implanted metal objects. The goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting acoustic emissions associated with boiling at the interface between a metal implant and surrounding soft tissue as a wireless safety sensing mechanism. Acoustic emissions generated during in vitro and in vivo AMF exposures were captured with a hydrophone, and the relationship with surface temperature analyzed. The effect of AMF exposure power, surrounding media composition, implant location within the AMF transmitter, and implant geometry on acoustic detection during AMF therapy was also evaluated. Acoustic emissions were reliably identified in both tissue-mimicking phantom and mouse studies, and their onset coincided with the implant temperature reaching the boiling threshold. The viscosity of the surrounding medium did not impact the production of acoustic emissions; however, emissions were not present when the medium was oil due to the higher boiling point. Results of simulations and in vivo studies suggest that short-duration, high-power AMF exposures combined with acoustic sensing can be used to minimize the amount of thermal damage in surrounding tissues. These studies support the hypothesis that detection of boiling associated acoustic emissions at a metal/tissue interface could serve as a real-time, wireless safety indicator during AMF treatment of biofilm on metallic implants.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Bingbing Cheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bingbing Cheng, Yonatan Chatzinoff, Debby Szczepanski, Chenchen Bing, Sumbul Shaikh, Omar Wyman, Cameron E.

Extracting and identifying genetic material from environmental media (i.e. water and soil) presents a unique opportunity for researchers to assess biotic diversity and ecosystem health with increased speed and decreased cost as compared to traditional methods (e.g. trapping). The heterogeneity of soil mineralogy, spatial and temporal variations however present unique challenges to sampling and interpreting results. Specifically, fate/transport of genetic material in the terrestrial environment represents a substantial data gap. Here we investigate to what degree, benthic fauna transport genetic material through soil. Using the red worm (Eisenia fetida), we investigate how natural movement through artificial soil affect the transport of genetic material. All experiments were run in Frabill® Habitat® II worm systems with approximately 5 cm depth of artificial soil. We selected an “exotic” source of DNA not expected to be present in soil, zebrafish (Danio rerio) tissue. Experiment groups contained homogenized zebrafish tissue placed in a defined location combined with a varying number of worms (10, 30 or 50 worms per experimental group). Experimental groups comprised two controls and three treatment groups (representing different worm biomass) in triplicate. A total of 210 soil samples were randomly collected over the course of 15 days to investigate the degree of genetic transfer, and the rate of detection. Positive detections were identified in 14% - 38% of samples across treatment groups, with an overall detection rate of 25%. These findings highlight two important issues when utilizing environmental DNA for biologic assessments. First, benthic fauna are capable of redistributing genetic material through a soil matrix. Second, despite a defined sample container and abundance of worm biomass, as many as 86% of the samples were negative. This has substantial implications for researchers and managers who wish to interpret environmental DNA results from terrestrial systems. Studies such as these will aid in future study protocol design and sample collection methodology.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><author><name>Christopher M.

Soil salinity is a common and serious environmental problem worldwide. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are considered as bio-ameliorators of soil salinity tolerance in plants. However, few studies have addressed the possible benefits of AMF inoculation for medicinal plants under saline conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of colonization with two AMF, &lt;i&gt;Funneliformis mosseae&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Diversispora versiformis&lt;/i&gt;, alone and in combination, on the growth and nutrient uptake of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt; (Hangbaiju) in a greenhouse salt stress experiment. After 6 weeks of a non-saline pretreatment, Hangbaiju plants with and without AMF were grown for five months under salinity levels that were achieved using 0, 50 and 200 mM NaCl. Root length, shoot and root dry weight, total dry weight, and root N concentration were higher in the mycorrhizal plants than in the non-mycorrhizal plants under conditions of moderate salinity, especially with &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; colonization. As salinity increased, mycorrhizal colonization and mycorrhizal dependence decreased. The enhancement of root N uptake is probably the main mechanism underlying salt tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. These results suggest that the symbiotic associations between the fungus &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;versiformis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;morifolium&lt;/i&gt; plants may be useful in biotechnological practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Yanhong Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanhong Wang, Minqiang Wang, Yan Li, Aiping Wu, Juying Huang&lt;/p&gt;

Characterisation and thermal deterioration of desi ghee obtained from buffalo milk is presented for the first time using the potential of Fluorescence spectroscopy. The emission bands in non-heated desi ghee centred at 375 nm is labelled for vitamin D, 390 nm for vitamin K, 440–460 nm for isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), 490 nm for vitamin A and the region 620–700 nm is assigned to chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission spectra from all the heated and non-heated ghee samples were recorded using excitation wavelengths at 280, and 410 nm which were found best for getting maximum spectral signatures. Heating of desi ghee affects its molecular composition, however, the temperature range from 140 to 170°C may be defined safe for cooking /frying where it does not lose much of its molecular composition. Further, the rise in temperature induces prominent spectral variations which confirm the deterioration of valuable vitamins, isomers of CLA and chlorophyll contents. Fluorescence emission peak at 552 nm shows oxidation product and an increase in its intensity with the rise in temperature is observed. In order to classify heated samples at different temperatures, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on heated and non-heated ghee samples that further elucidated the temperature effects.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><author><name>Naveed Ahmad</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naveed Ahmad, M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Western music is based on intervals; thus, interval discrimination is important for distinguishing the character of melodies or tracking melodies in polyphonic music. In this study the encoding of intervals in simultaneously presented sound is studied.&lt;/p&gt; Study design &lt;p&gt;In an electrophysiological experiment in 15 normal-hearing non-musicians, major thirds or fifths were presented in a controlled oddball paradigm. Harmonic intervals were created by simultaneously presented sinusoidals with randomized root frequency. Mismatch negativity (MMN) responses were measured with an EEG recording. The discrimination index was calculated in a psychoacoustic experiment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A clear MMN response was found for the major third but not for the fifth. The neural generators were located within the auditory cortices. Psychoacoustically, no evidence was found that the subjects were able to detect the deviants.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We conclude that pre-attentive discrimination of harmonic interval size is, in principle, possible in listeners without musical training although simultaneous presentation makes it harder to distinguish compared to non-overlapping intervals. Furthermore we see a difference in the response to infrequent dissonant stimuli in consonant standard stimuli compared to the opposite, rare consonant stimuli in dissonant standard stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524690000000</published><author><name>Luise Wagner</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Luise Wagner, Torsten Rahne, Stefan K.

Our aims were to quantify and map the plant sub regions of the the Caatinga, that covers 844,453 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and is the largest block of seasonally dry forest in South America. We performed spatial analyses of the largest dataset of woody plant distributions in this region assembled to date (of 2,666 shrub and tree species; 260 localities), compared these distributions with the current phytogeographic regionalizations, and investigated the potential environmental drivers of the floristic patterns in these sub regions. Phytogeographical regions were identified using quantitative analyses of species turnover calculated as Simpson dissimilarity index. We applied an interpolation method to map NMDS axes of compositional variation over the entire extent of the Caatinga, and then classified the compositional dissimilarity according to the number of biogeographical sub regions identified a priori using k-means analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression models to investigate the influence of contemporary climatic productivity, topographic complexity, soil characteristics, climate stability since the last glacial maximum, and the human footprint in explaining the identified sub regions. We identified nine spatially cohesive biogeographical sub regions. Current productivity, as indicated by an aridity index, was the only explanatory variable retained in the best model, explaining nearly half of the floristic variability between sub regions. The highest rates of endemism within the Caatinga were in the Core and Periphery Chapada Diamantina sub regions. Our findings suggest that the topographic complexity, soil variation, and human footprint in the Caatinga act on woody plant distributions at local scales and not as determinants of broad floristic patterns. The lack of effect of climatic stability since the last glacial maximum probably results from the fact that a single measure of climatic stability does not adequately capture the highly dynamic climatic shifts the region suffered during the Pleistocene.

To determine the molecular underpinnings of the disease risk of the heterogeneous GlycA signal, we used machine learning to build imputation models for GlycA&apos;s constituent glycoproteins, then estimated glycoprotein levels in 11,861 adults across two population-based cohorts with long-term follow-up. While alpha-1- acid glycoprotein had the strongest correlation with GlycA, our analysis revealed that alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) was the most predictive of morbidity and mortality for the widest range of diseases, including heart failure (HR=1.60 per s.d., P=1x10-10), influenza and pneumonia (HR=1.37, P=6x10-10), and liver diseases (HR=1.81, P=1x10-6). Despite emerging evidence of AAT&apos;s role in suppressing inflammation, transcriptional analyses revealed elevated expression of diverse inflammatory immune pathways with elevated AAT levels, suggesting AAT is elevating to compensate for low-grade chronic inflammation.

To determine the molecular underpinnings of the disease risk of the heterogeneous GlycA signal, we used machine learning to build imputation models for GlycA&apos;s constituent glycoproteins, then estimated glycoprotein levels in 11,861 adults across two population-based cohorts with long-term follow-up.

Avian embryos are among the most convenient and the primary representatives for the study of classical embryology. It is well-known that the hatching time of duck embryos is approximately one week longer than that of chicken embryos. However, the key features associated with the slower embryonic development in ducks have not been adequately described. This study aimed to characterize the pattern and the speed of early embryogenesis in Brown Tsaiya Ducks (BTD) compared with those in Taiwan Country Chicken (TCC) by using growth parameters including embryonic crown-tail length (ECTL), primitive streak formation, somitogenesis, and other development-related parameters, during the first 72 h of incubation. Three hundred and sixty eggs from BTD and TCC, respectively, were incubated at 37.2°C, and were then dissected hourly to evaluate their developmental stages. We found that morphological changes of TCC embryos shared a major similarity with that of the Hamburger and Hamilton staging system during early chick embryogenesis. The initial primitive streak in TCC emerged between 6 and 7 h post-incubation, but its emergence was delayed until 10 to 13 h post-incubation in BTD. Similarly, the limb primordia (wing and limb buds) were observed at 51 h post-incubation in TCC embryos compared to 64 h post-incubation in BTD embryos. The allantois first appeared around 65 to 68 h in TCC embryos, but it was not observed in BTD embryos. At the 72 h post-incubation, 40 somites were clearly formed in TCC embryos while only 32 somites in BTD embryos. Overall, the BTD embryos developed approximately 16 h slower than the chicken embryo during the first 72 h of development. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to describe two distinct developmental time courses between TCC and BTD, which would facilitate future embryogenesis-related studies of the two important avian species in Taiwan.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Chompunut Lumsangkul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chompunut Lumsangkul, Yang-Kwang Fan, Shen-Chang Chang, Jyh-Cherng Ju, Hsin-I.

The identification of germplasm resources is an important aspect of sugarcane breeding. The aim of this study was to introduce a new method for identifying &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and its progeny. First, we cloned and sequenced nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (nrDNA-ITS) sequences from 20 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms. Analysis of these nrDNA-ITS sequences showed a stable mutation at base 89. Primers (FO13, RO13, FI16, and RI16) were then designed for tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) PCR based on mutations at base 89 of the nrDNA-ITS sequence. An additional 71 &lt;i&gt;Saccharum&lt;/i&gt; germplasms were identified using this tetra-primer ARMS PCR method, which confirmed that the method using the described primers successfully identified &lt;i&gt;Saccharum spontaneum&lt;/i&gt; and progeny. These results may help improve the efficiency of modern molecular breeding of sugarcane and lay a foundation for identification of sugarcane germplasms and the relationships among them.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526504400000</published><author><name>Shan Yang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shan Yang, Xueting Li, Fei Huang, Yongji Huang, Xinlong Liu, Jiayun Wu, Qinnan Wang, Zuhu Deng, Rukai Chen, Muqing Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics.

To establish 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference ranges based on anthropometry in healthy Chinese children, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using twice-sampled 24-h urine and anthropometric variables. Age- and sex-specific 24-h creatinine excretion reference ranges (crude and related to individual anthropometric variables) were derived. During October 2013 and May 2014, urine samples were collected. Anthropometric variables were measured in the first survey. Data of 710 children (377 boys and 333 girls) aged 8–13 years who completed the study were analyzed. No significant difference was observed in 24-h urine volumes between the two samples (median [interquartile range): 855.0 [600.0–1272.0) mL vs. 900.0 [660.0–1220.0) mL, P = 0.277). The mean 24-h urine creatinine excretion was regarded as representative of absolute daily creatinine excretion in children. Sex-specific, body-weight-adjusted creatinine excretion reference values were 15.3 mg/kg/day (0.1353 mmol/kg/day) for boys and 14.3 mg/kg/day (0.1264 mmol/kg/day) for girls. Differences were significant between boys and girls within the same age group but not across different age groups within the same sex. Ideal 24-h creatinine excretion values for height were derived for potential determination of the creatinine height index. These data can serve as reference ranges to calculate ratios of analyte to creatinine. The creatinine height index can be used to assess somatic protein status.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Cong Du, Laixiang Lin, Wen Chen, Long Tan, Jun Shen, Elizabeth N.

TadeuszAndruniów</name></author><description>The initial S1 excited‐state relaxation of retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB) analog with central C11C12 double bond locked by eight‐membered ring (locked‐11.8) was investigated by means of multireference perturbation theory methods (XMCQDPT2, XMS‐CASPT2, MS‐CASPT2) as well as single‐reference coupled‐cluster CC2 method. The analysis of XMCQDPT2‐based geometries reveals rather weak coupling between in‐plane and out‐of‐plane structural evolution and minor energetical relaxation of three locked‐11.8 conformers. Therefore, a strong coupling between bonds length inversion and backbone out‐of‐plane deformation resulting in a very steep S1 energy profile predicted by CASSCF/CASPT2 calculations is in clear contradiction with the reference XMCQDPT2 results. Even though CC2 method predicts good quality ground‐state structures, the excited‐state structures display more advanced torsional deformation leading to ca. 0.2 eV exaggerated energy relaxation and significantly red shifted (0.4–0.7 eV) emission maxima. According to our findings, the initial photoisomerization process in locked‐11.8, and possibly in other RPSB analogs, studied fully (both geometries and energies) by multireference perturbation theory may be somewhat slower than predicted by CASSCF/CASPT2 or CC2 methods. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25346?af=R</link><crawled>1525605189279</crawled><summary><content>The initial S1 excited‐state relaxation of retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB) analog with central C11C12 double bond locked by eight‐membered ring (locked‐11.8) was investigated by means of multireference perturbation theory methods (XMCQDPT2, XMS‐CASPT2, MS‐CASPT2) as well as single‐reference coupled‐cluster CC2 method.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine predictors for understanding reason for hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective, observational cohort study of patients 65 years or older admitted for acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, or pneumonia and discharged home.Primary outcome was complete understanding of diagnosis, based on post-discharge patient interview.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>De Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>4fd958f</fingerprint><crawled>1524766155374</crawled><engagement>882</engagement><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1630325226e:3dd916:fc1f8953</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Mitigating global infectious disease requires diagnostic tools that are sensitive, specific, and rapidly field deployable.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that quantifies the magnetic susceptibility distribution within biological tissues. QSM calculates the underlying magnetic susceptibility by deconvolving the tissue magnetic field map with a unit dipole kernel. However, this deconvolution problem is ill-posed. The morphology enabled dipole inversion (MEDI) introduces total variation (TV) to regularize the susceptibility reconstruction. However, MEDI results still contain artifacts near tissue boundaries because MEDI only imposes TV constraint on voxels inside smooth regions. We introduce a Morphology-Adaptive TV (MATV) for improving TV-regularized QSM. The MATV method first classifies imaging target into smooth and nonsmooth regions by thresholding magnitude gradients. In the dipole inversion for QSM, the TV regularization weights are a monotonically decreasing function of magnitude gradients. Thus, voxels inside smooth regions are assigned with larger weights than those in nonsmooth regions. Using phantom and in vivo datasets, we compared the performance of MATV with that of MEDI. MATV results had better visual quality than MEDI results, especially near tissue boundaries. Preliminary brain imaging results illustrated that MATV has potential to improve the reconstruction of regions near tissue boundaries.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><author><name>Li Guo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Guo, Yingjie Mei, Jijing Guan, Xiangliang Tan, Yikai Xu, Wufan Chen, Qianjin Feng, Yanqiu Feng&lt;/p&gt;

Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system’s plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527022800000</published><author><name>Anna C.

Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527022800000</published><author><name>Wen-Yu Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wen-Yu Wang, Bing Ge, Ju Shi, Xu Zhou, Long-Fei Wu, Chang-Hua Tang, Dong-Cheng Zhu, Hong Zhu, Xing-Bo Mo, Yong-Hong Zhang, Fei-Yan Deng, Shu-Feng Lei&lt;/p&gt;
Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1–3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197732</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>4af921f</fingerprint><crawled>1526378564531</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16363408bb3:37d6198:2835af05</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33068</originId><published>1526342400000</published><title>Ripply2 recruits proteasome complex for Tbx6 degradation to define segment border during murine somitogenesis</title><description>The metameric structure in vertebrates is based on the periodic formation of somites from the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm (PSM).

Primary brain microvessels (BrMV) maintain the cellular characters and molecular signatures as displayed in vivo, and serve as a vital tool for biomedical research of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the development/optimization of brain drug delivery. The variations of relative purities or cellular composition among different BrMV samples may have significant consequences in data interpretation and research outcome, especially for experiments with high-throughput genomics and proteomics technologies. In this study, we aimed to identify suitable reference gene (RG) for accurate normalization of real-time RT-qPCR analysis, and determine the proper marker genes (MG) for relative purity assessment in BrMV samples. Out of five housekeeping genes, β-actin was selected as the most suitable RG that was validated by quantifying mRNA levels of alpha-L-iduronidase in BrMV isolated from mice with one or two expressing alleles. Four marker genes highly/selectively expressed in BBB-forming capillary endothelial cells were evaluated by RT-qPCR for purity assessment, resulting in &lt;i&gt;Cldn&lt;/i&gt;5 and &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt; as most suitable MGs that were further confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis of cellular components. &lt;i&gt;Plvap&lt;/i&gt; proved to be an indicator gene for the presence of fenestrated vessels in BrMV samples.

The reliability of any quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment can be seriously compromised by variations between samples as well as between PCR runs. This usually result from errors in sample quantification, especially with samples that are obtained from different individuals and tissues and have been collected at various time intervals. Errors also arise from differences in qPCR efficiency between assays performed simultaneously to target multiple genes on the same plate. Consequently, the derived quantitative data for the target genes become distorted. To avoid this grievous error, an endogenous control, with relatively constant transcription levels in the target individual or tissue, is included in the qPCR assay to normalize target gene expression levels in the analysis. Several housekeeping genes (HKGs) have been used as endogenous controls in quantification studies of mRNA transcripts; however, there is no record in the literature of the evaluation of these genes for the tick-borne protozoan parasite, &lt;i&gt;Theileria parva&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, the expression of these genes should be invariable between different &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks, ideally under different experimental conditions, to gain extensive application in gene expression studies of this parasite. Thus, the expression of several widely used HKGs was evaluated in this study, including the genes encoding β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 28S rRNA, cytochrome b and fructose-2.6-biphosphate aldolase (F6P) proteins. The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks investigated, the cattle-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; Muguga and the buffalo-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; 7014. 28S rRNA and β-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525467600000</published><author><name>Teboho N.

The qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of genes encoding cytochrome b, F6P and GAPDH varied considerably between the two &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; stocks investigated, the cattle-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; Muguga and the buffalo-derived &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt; 7014. 28S rRNA and β-actin gene expression was the most stable; thus, these genes were considered suitable candidates to be used as endogenous control genes for mRNA quantification studies in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;parva&lt;/i&gt;.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</link><crawled>1525455544496</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196715</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>84c93d98</fingerprint><title>Optimal Point Process Filtering for Birth-Death Model Estimation [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1633758f97c:24cf94e:5785ab88</id><content><content>The discrete space, continuous time birth-death model is a key process for describing phylogenies in the absence of coalescent approximations.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Faris Ghazal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Faris Ghazal, Holger Theobald, Mårten Rosenqvist, Faris Al-Khalili&lt;/p&gt;

We analyze the model of social interactions with coevolution of the topology and states of the nodes. This model can be interpreted as a model of language change. We propose different rewiring mechanisms and perform numerical simulations for each. Obtained results are compared with the empirical data gathered from two online databases and anthropological study of Solomon Islands. We study the behavior of the number of languages for different system sizes and we find that only local rewiring, i.e. triadic closure, is capable of reproducing results for the empirical data in a qualitative manner. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Tomasz Raducha</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Raducha, Tomasz Gubiec&lt;/p&gt;

These population activities are nevertheless necessary and sufficient to discriminate visual stimuli with high accuracy, suggesting that the neural code in the primary visual cortex is both super-sparse and highly efficient.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><author><name>tangshm@pku.edu.cn (Fang Liu)</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33370</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>3fee2af</fingerprint><title>Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16318a22675:2181a40:fc1f8953</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&amp;lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.), Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25219-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/1uTIaaSFfXk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525158000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9</href></item></canonical><author><name>Yan Zi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&amp;lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&amp;lt;/i&gt; L.), Published online: 01 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25219-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Grain Yield, Starch Content and Activities of Key Enzymes of Waxy and Non-waxy Wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt; L.)&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/1uTIaaSFfXk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9</link><crawled>1525126669941</crawled><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25219-9</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/1uTIaaSFfXk/s41598-018-25219-9</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>19d30226</fingerprint><title>Tradeoffs between immune function and childhood growth among Amazonian forager-horticulturalists [Anthropology]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_162f8a5b82f:6a632bc:9f3b30f2</id><content><content>Immune function is an energetically costly physiological activity that potentially diverts calories away from less immediately essential life tasks.

Digital image processing is widely used in the non-destructive diagnosis of plant nutrition. Previous plant nitrogen diagnostic studies have mostly focused on characteristics of the rice canopy or leaves at some specific points in time, with the long sampling intervals unable to provide detailed and specific “dynamic features.” According to plant growth mechanisms, the dynamic changing rate in leaf shape and color differ between different nitrogen supplements. Therefore, the objective of this study was to diagnose nitrogen stress levels by analyzing the dynamic characteristics of rice leaves. Scanning technology was implemented to collect rice leaf images every 3 days, with the characteristics of the leaves from different leaf positions extracted utilizing MATLAB. Newly developed shape characteristics such as etiolation area (EA) and etiolation degree (ED), in addition to shape (area, perimeter) and color characteristics (green, normalized red index, etc.), were used to quantify the process of leaf change. These characteristics allowed sensitive indices to be established for further model validation. Our results indicate that the changing rates in dynamic characteristics, in particular the shape characteristics of the first incomplete leaf (FIL) and the characteristics of the 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; leaf (leaf color and etiolation indices), expressed obvious distinctions among different nitrogen treatments. Consequently, we achieved acceptable diagnostic accuracy (training accuracy 77.3%, validation accuracy 64.4%) by using the FIL at six days after leaf emergence, and the new shape characteristics developed in this article (ED and EA) also showed good performance in nitrogen diagnosis. Based on the aforementioned results, dynamic analysis is valuable not only in further studies but also in practice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><author><name>Yuanyuan Sun</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanyuan Sun, Shaochun Zhu, Xuan Yang, Melanie Valerie Weston, Ke Wang, Zhangquan Shen, Hongwei Xu, Lisu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

FrancescIllas</name></author><description>Systematic addition of Li atoms to the Be2B8 and Be2B36 backbones has been studied by density functional theory‐based calculations with the aim to investigate properties of interest on possible anode materials for Li‐based batteries. For the Be2B8Lin (n = 1–8) and the Be2B36Lin (n = 1–20) systems, lithium salts are dominant whereas a clear electride feature shows up for Be2B8Lin (n = 9–14) and Be2B36Li21. Addition of hydrogen radicals to these systems shows that the Be2B8Li14 electride becomes a Be2B8Li14H2 hydride electride whereas Be2B36Li21 leads to a Be2B36Li21H salt. Moreover, for the addition of Li atoms to Be2B8 and the Be2B36 backbones, large values of the interaction and of the adsorption energy per Li atom, high specific capacity of Be2B8Li14 and of Be2B36Li21 (1860 and 1017 mAh g−1, respectively) and low and flat voltage associated with lithiation have been found.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Jennifer L.

The application of set cover to pathway enrichment results produces an optimised summary of the pathways that best represent the differentially regulated gene set.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/319731</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1526078095893</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319731v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>975b18bb</fingerprint><title>Melissa: Bayesian clustering and imputation of single cell methylomes [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16321f4daf3:613d1d:3dd877af</id><content><content>Measurements of DNA methylation at the single cell level are promising to revolutionise our understanding of epigenetic control of gene expression.

The rickettsiae are obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that exhibit a complex infectious life cycle in both arthropod and mammalian hosts. As obligate intracellular bacteria, rickettsiae are highly adapted to living inside a variety of host cells, including vascular endothelial cells during mammalian infection. Although it is assumed that the rickettsiae produce numerous virulence factors that usurp or disrupt various host cell pathways, they have been challenging to genetically manipulate to identify the key bacterial factors that contribute to infection. Motivated to overcome this challenge, we sought to expand the repertoire of available rickettsial loss-of-function mutants, using an improved &lt;i&gt;mariner&lt;/i&gt;-based transposon mutagenesis scheme. Here, we present the isolation of over 100 transposon mutants in the spotted fever group species &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia parkeri&lt;/i&gt;. Transposon insertions disrupted genes whose products are implicated in a variety of pathways, including bacterial replication and metabolism, the type IV secretion system, factors with previously established roles in host cell interactions and pathogenesis, or are of unknown function. Given the need to identify critical virulence factors, forward genetic screens such as this will provide an excellent platform to more directly investigate rickettsial biology and pathogenesis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><author><name>Rebecca L.

Intralesional (IL) injection of Rose Bengal (PV-10) induces regression of injected and uninjected lesions in several murine tumor models. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor response of combining IL PV-10 with blockade of the PD-1 / PD-L1 pathway and the role of immune cell populations in eliciting this response. To investigate the role of T cell subsets in mediating an immune response, B16 or M05 melanoma-bearing mice received combination therapy as well as CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibodies. Tumor growth was measured. T cells were collected from spleens or tumors, and phenotype, activation markers, and reactivity were measured. Splenocytes from mice treated with combination therapy had increased OVA antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in M05-tumor-bearing mice. Depletion of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells or regulatory T cells (Tregs) in combination with IL PV-10 and anti-PD-1 antibody treatment resulted in an enhanced anti-tumor effect. Treatment with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depleting antibody abrogated anti-tumor immunity.

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; origins of ALL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526418000000</published><author><name>Jeremy M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing has the potential to deliver innovative healthcare within limited finances. However, uptake has been slow, and a proportion of non-medical prescribers do not use the qualification. This systematic review aimed to describe the facilitators and barriers to non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The systematic review and thematic analysis included qualitative and mixed methods papers reporting facilitators and barriers to independent non-medical prescribing in the United Kingdom. The following databases were searched to identify relevant papers: AMED, ASSIA, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, MEDLINE, Open Grey, Open access theses and dissertations, and Web of Science. Papers published between 2006 and March 2017 were included. Studies were quality assessed using a validated tool (QATSDD), then underwent thematic analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42015019786).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 3991 potentially relevant identified studies, 42 were eligible for inclusion. The studies were generally of moderate quality (83%), and most (71%) were published 2007–2012. The nursing profession dominated the studies (30/42). Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: non-medical prescriber, human factors, and organisational aspects. Each theme consisted of several sub-themes; the four most highly mentioned were ‘medical professionals’, ‘area of competence’, ‘impact on time’ and ‘service’. Sub-themes were frequently interdependent on each other, having the potential to act as a barrier or facilitator depending on circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Addressing the identified themes and subthemes enables strategies to be developed to support and optimise non-medical prescribing.

Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters. Results: We introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Meta-genomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic an-notation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524553200000</published><author><name>Plaza Onate, F.</name></author><description>Motivation: Analysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available.

The resulting RBH graph maps the landscape of interconnected factors that can be associated to biological processes or to technological artefacts. These factors can be used as clinical biomarkers or robust and tumor-type specific transcriptomic signatures of tumoral cells or tumoral microenvironment. Their intensities in different samples shed light on the mechanistic basis of CRC molecular subtyping.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/09/318154</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318154v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1525875678799</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318154v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/318154v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>385a67a</fingerprint><title>Changes in the amino acid profiles and free radical scavenging activities of &amp;lt;i&gt;Tenebrio molitor&amp;lt;/i&gt; larvae following enzymatic hydrolysis</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525467600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1632c3c60b0:1621671:3dd877af</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Yujiao Tang, Trishna Debnath, Eun-Ju Choi, Young Wook Kim, Jung Pyo Ryu, Sejin Jang, Sang Uk Chung, Young-Jin Choi, Eun-Kyung Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Background and aims &lt;p&gt;Measles is an infectious disease that represents a serious public health problem worldwide, being associated with increased susceptibility to secondary infections, especially in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The aim of this study was to evaluate sCD163 and sCD14 levels in measles virus (MV) infected patients, as markers of immune activation, in order to better understand their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. TNF-α plasma levels were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;sCD163, sCD14 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA in plasma samples of 27 MV infected patients and 27 healthy donors (HD) included as controls.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;At the time of hospital admission, sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly higher in MV infected patients than in HD, while a decrease in TNF-α levels were found even if without statistical significance. sCD163 and sCD14 levels were significantly decreased after two months from acute infection compared to hospital admission although they remained significantly higher compared to HD. TNF-α levels increased significantly during the follow-up period. Considering clinical parameters, sCD163 levels positively correlated with aspartate aminotransferase, white blood cell count and neutrophils rate, while negatively correlated with the lymphocyte percentage. sCD14 levels positively correlated with the neutrophil and lymphocyte percentages.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;These results indicate that, despite the resolution of symptoms, an important macrophage/monocyte activation persists in measles patients, even after two months from infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Claudia Mascia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudia Mascia, Irene Pozzetto, Blerta Kertusha, Raffaella Marocco, Cosmo Del Borgo, Tiziana Tieghi, Serena Vita, Stefano Savinelli, Marco Iannetta, Vincenzo Vullo, Miriam Lichtner, Claudio Maria Mastroianni&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated testosterone (T) is routinely reported as a marker of hyperandrogenemia in rodent models for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In women with PCOS, elevated serum androstenedione (A4) is associated with more severe phenotypes, including a positive correlation with serum T, DHEAS, free androgen index (FAI), LH, and LH/FSH ratio. Furthermore, A4, along with calculated free T and FAI, was identified as one of the best predictors of PCOS in adult women of all ages (18 to &gt; 50 y).&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate serum A4 levels in early adolescent and young adult prenatally androgenized (PNA) female rats, a model for PCOS.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Pregnant rats were injected with 5 mg T daily during gestational days 16–19 (PNA rats, experimental group) or an equal volume of vehicle (control group). Female offspring of both groups had tail vein blood drawn for serum analysis at 8 and 16 weeks of age. ELISAs were used to quantify serum A4 and T levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Serum A4 and T were elevated in 16-week-old PNA rats compared to controls. There was no significant difference in either hormone at 8 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The PNA rats demonstrated elevated serum A4 and T in young adulthood, as has been observed in women with PCOS, further validating this as a model for PCOS and underscoring the importance of serum A4 elevation as a parameter inherent to PCOS and a rodent model for the disorder.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Appropriate demand for, and supply of, high quality essential neonatal care is key to improving newborn survival but evaluating such provision has received limited attention in low- and middle-income countries. Moreover, specific local data are needed to support healthcare planning for this vulnerable population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted health facility assessments between July 2015-April 2016, with retrospective review of admission events between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; July 2014 and 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2015, and used estimates of population-based incidence of neonatal conditions in Nairobi to explore access and evaluate readiness of public, private not-for-profit (mission), and private-for-profit (private) sector facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 33 (4 public, 6 mission, and 23 private) facilities providing 24/7 inpatient neonatal care in Nairobi City County were identified, 31 were studied in detail. Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (&amp;lt;50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Georgina A.

Four public sector facilities, including the only three facilities in which services were free, accounted for 71% (8,630/12,202) of all neonatal admissions. Large facilities (&gt;900 annual admissions) with adequate infrastructure tended to have high bed occupancy (over 100% in two facilities), high mortality (15%), and high patient to nurse ratios (7–15 patients per nurse). Twenty-one smaller, predominantly private, facilities were judged insufficiently resourced to provide adequate care. In many of these, nurses provided newborn and maternity care simultaneously using resources shared across settings, newborn care experience was likely to be limited (&amp;lt;50 cases per year), there was often no resident clinician, and sick babies were often referred onwards. Results suggest 44% (9,764/21,966) of Nairobi’s small and sick newborns may not access any of the identified facilities and a further 9% (2,026/21,966) access facilities judged to be inadequately equipped.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Over 50% of Nairobi’s sick newborns may not access a facility with adequate resources to provide essential care. A very high proportion of care accessed is provided by four public and one low cost mission facility; these face major challenges of high patient acuity (high mortality), high patient to nurse ratios, and often overcrowding. Reducing high neonatal mortality in this urban, predominantly poor, population will require effective long-term, multi-sectoral planning and investment.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</link><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196585</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>fafdb084</fingerprint><title>A loop-counting method for covariate-corrected low-rank biclustering of gene-expression and genome-wide association study data</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><updated>1526331600000</updated><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1635fcbc875:d5807:d63e3ae2</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006105</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006105</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

From 2006 to 2013, an increasing incidence of fusariosis was observed in the hematologic patients of our University Hospital. We suspected of an environmental source, and the indoor hospital air was investigated as a potential source of the fungemia. Air samplings were performed in the hematology and bone marrow transplant (BMT) wards using an air sampler with pre-defined air volumes. To study the molecular relationship among environmental and clinical isolates, 18 &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from blood cultures were included in the study. DNA sequencing of a partial portion of &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt; gene was performed for molecular identification. Molecular typing was carried out by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) using a four-gene scheme: &lt;i&gt;TEF1α&lt;/i&gt;, rDNA, &lt;i&gt;RPB1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;RPB2&lt;/i&gt;. One hundred four isolates were recovered from the air of the hematology (n = 76) and the BMT (n = 28) wards. &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates from the air were from five species complexes: &lt;i&gt;Fusarium fujikuroi&lt;/i&gt; (FFSC, n = 56), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti&lt;/i&gt; (FIESC, n = 24), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; (FSSC, n = 13), &lt;i&gt;Fusarium chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt; (FCSC, n = 10), and &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; (FOSC, n = 1). Fifteen &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; isolates recovered from blood belonged to FSSC, and three to FFSC. MLST identified the same sequence type (ST) in clinical and environmental isolates. ST1 was found in 5 isolates from blood and in 7 from the air, both identified as FSSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium petroliphilum&lt;/i&gt;). STn1 was found in one isolate from blood and in one from the air, both identified as FFSC (&lt;i&gt;Fusarium napiforme&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt; was isolated from the air of the hospital room of the patient with fungemia due to &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;napiforme&lt;/i&gt;. These findings suggested a possible clonal origin of the &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; spp. recovered from air and bloodcultures. In conclusion, our study found a diversity of &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species in the air of our hospital, and a possible role of the air as source of systemic fusariosis in our immunocompromised patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Maria Luiza Moretti</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luiza Moretti, Ariane Fidelis Busso-Lopes, Cibele Aparecida Tararam, Renato Moraes, Yasunori Muraosa, Yuzuru Mikami, Tohru Gonoi, Hideaki Taguchi, Luzia Lyra, Franqueline Reichert-Lima, Plínio Trabasso, Gerrit Sybren de Hoog, Abdullah Mohammed Said Al-Hatmi, Angelica Zaninelli Schreiber, Katsuhiko Kamei&lt;/p&gt;

They’re specifically addressing the “make it less lipophilic” rule of thumb that many medicinal chemists have, and they demonstrate that this isn’t exactly a universal law. You have to take it case by case, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/Clearance-plot.jpeg 818w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13511&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re working from Genentech’s large database of rat i.v. PK data, stability in rat heptatocytes, and measured (not calculated) logD values. That’s a lot of hard-won data (4767 compounds total), and I’m glad that they’re sharing conclusion from it. The plot at right is an example; each dot is a compound, and they’re shaded according to logD values (&amp;lt;0 to &gt;4). What you see is that IV clearance and (unbound, steady-state) volume of distribution are strongly correlated, and that for the most part this graph is spread along compound lipophilicity. There are outliers (there are always outliers), but that’s the way to bet. As for half-life itself, the spreads in the data are pretty wide, but if anything, higher lipophilicity is correlated with longer i.v. half-life. The Merck paper linked to above also noted that increasing lipophilicity can be a way to extend half-life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in that paper, the Genentech team also did an extensive matched-molecular-pairs analysis, and they found a number of transformations that have a good probability of extending half-life (and they’re similar to the earlier paper). Nitrile to fluoroalkyl, methyl to fluorinated methyl, H to CF3, and tetrahydropyran to phenyl all have a good shot. In general, improving clearance in the rat hepatocyte assay has about a 67% chance of helping your half-life, and if you can do that without decreasing lipophilicity, you have an 82% shot. (I would guess that many of those are fluorinations and chlorinations). Just lowering the LogD, on the other hand, only works about 30% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But wait”, you may be saying. “If I start halogenating my compound, its solubility will probably go to pieces and its off-target binding may well go up!” This, in those deal-with-the-devil stories, is the point where the mysterious stranger slips up and his business partner catches a glimpse of his cloven feet. That is exactly the sort of deal being offered by pharmacokinetics and compound property analysis: no free lunch has yet been delivered. You have to make these changes in full knowledge that helping one aspect of the compound’s behavior may well hurt another one, and proceed accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis (as the paper notes) doesn’t deal with charged compounds; they’re a whole other subject. And it also doesn’t go into the other ways around these problems, such as slow-release formulations, etc. But discovery-phase projects generally aren’t thinking about those things either – they’re trying to get compound behavior that doesn’t need the extra work later on. So if you’re in that part of the business, the advice from this paper is to pay attention to hepatocyte clearance assays, don’t be afraid to keep your lipophilicity where it is (or even raise it a bit, while watching for potential trouble), and don’t assume that just making the compound more polar is going to fix much of anything. And pay attention to metabolic hot spots – those are a big reason why those halogenations keep working  in these analyses. It’s more work to do metabolite ID, and often more difficult, chemically, to address those problems than it is to make general polarity changes. But it’s time well spent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13510</originId><published>1525351064000</published><title>Pharmacokinetic Advice From Genentech</title><description>Here’s another solid pharmacokinetics paper, this one from Genentech, with advice on how to extend drug half-life (compare this other recent one).

Cells respond to stressful conditions by coordinating a complex, multi-faceted response that spans many levels of physiology. Much of the response is coordinated by changes in protein phosphorylation. Although the regulators of transcriptome changes during stress are well characterized in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, the upstream regulatory network controlling protein phosphorylation is less well dissected. Here, we developed a computational approach to infer the signaling network that regulates phosphorylation changes in response to salt stress. We developed an approach to link predicted regulators to groups of likely co-regulated phospho-peptides responding to stress, thereby creating new edges in a background protein interaction network. We then use integer linear programming (ILP) to integrate wild type and mutant phospho-proteomic data and predict the network controlling stress-activated phospho-proteomic changes. The network we inferred predicted new regulatory connections between stress-activated and growth-regulating pathways and suggested mechanisms coordinating metabolism, cell-cycle progression, and growth during stress. We confirmed several network predictions with co-immunoprecipitations coupled with mass-spectrometry protein identification and mutant phospho-proteomic analysis. Results show that the cAMP-phosphodiesterase Pde2 physically interacts with many stress-regulated transcription factors targeted by PKA, and that reduced phosphorylation of those factors during stress requires the Rck2 kinase that we show physically interacts with Pde2. Together, our work shows how a high-quality computational network model can facilitate discovery of new pathway interactions during osmotic stress.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sNFhadDEsvQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006088</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew E.

BK virus (BKV) associated nephropathy affects 1–10% of kidney transplant recipients, leading to graft failure in about 50% of cases. Immune responses against different BKV antigens have been shown to have a prognostic value for disease development. Data currently suggest that the structural antigens and regulatory antigens of BKV might each trigger a different mode of action of the immune response. To study the influence of different modes of action of the cellular immune response on BKV clearance dynamics, we have analysed the kinetics of BKV plasma load and anti-BKV T cell response (Elispot) in six patients with BKV associated nephropathy using ODE modelling. The results show that only a small number of hypotheses on the mode of action are compatible with the empirical data. The hypothesis with the highest empirical support is that structural antigens trigger blocking of virus production from infected cells, whereas regulatory antigens trigger an acceleration of death of infected cells. These differential modes of action could be important for our understanding of BKV resolution, as according to the hypothesis, only regulatory antigens would trigger a fast and continuous clearance of the viral load. Other hypotheses showed a lower degree of empirical support, but could potentially explain the clearing mechanisms of individual patients. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the dynamics, including the delay between immune response against structural versus regulatory antigens, and its relevance for BKV clearance. Our modelling approach is the first that studies the process of BKV clearance by bringing together viral and immune kinetics and can provide a framework for personalised hypotheses generation on the interrelations between cellular immunity and viral dynamics.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8poCgXZvMAQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005998</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005998</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Arturo Blazquez-Navarro, Thomas Schachtner, Ulrik Stervbo, Anett Sefrin, Maik Stein, Timm H.

To examine the fetal immune system in the relevant clinical setting, we analyzed maternal and cord blood in patients with PTL and healthy term controls.

Our findings indicate that fetal inflammation and rejection of maternal antigens can contribute to the signaling cascade that promotes uterine contractility and that aberrant fetal immune responses should be considered in the pathogenesis of PTL.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/438/eaan2263.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaan2263?rss=1</link><crawled>1524679859179</crawled><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaan2263?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/438/eaan2263?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>bdb0ece2</fingerprint><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce942:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><title>Multiple parasites speed host evolution</title><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/870.17.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Anatomy, Morphology, Biomechanics, Evolution</item></keywords><author><name>Ash, C.</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/870-q?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>32064c23</fingerprint><title>LFAQ: towards unbiased label-free absolute protein quantification by predicting peptide quantitative factors [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1638e0fa5fb:778d5eb:93d646dc</id><content><content>Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a prominent choice for large-scale absolute protein quantification, but its quantification accuracy still has substantial room for improvement.

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with multiple myeloma included in prospective clinical trials are highly selected and therefore are expected not to be representative of the entire patient population. Additionally recommendations based on literature data and randomized trials are not systematically implemented in all patients. We sought to determine how patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are currently treated in France.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed a nation-wide search using the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information (PMSI) database which includes anonymous data for all patients hospitalized in France. We identified newly diagnosed cases in 2012 and analyzed the number and duration of hospital stays, coexisting conditions and treatment modalities with data available until the end of 2015. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma was determined for the first time during a hospitalization in France in 2012 in 6,282 patients (3,234 males and 3,048 females). The median age at diagnosis was 74 years (72 in males and 76 in females). A majority (55.3%) of patients were diagnosed and treated in a single heath center, including 37% in a university hospital and 52% in a non-university public hospital. Comorbidities potentially impacting on myeloma treatment were present in 57.5% of patients at diagnosis, and 15% had an associated diagnosis of another neoplasia. Intensive therapies with stem cell transplants were performed in 1033 patients (16% of total), the majority of which were aged less than 65 (881 patients, 85.3%). Stem cell transplants were performed more frequently in males while the distance between the site of residence and the transplant center had no impact on likelihood of receiving a transplant. Only 60% of patients less than 65 years old who were treated for their disease underwent intensification with stem cell transplant within the 4-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;A large majority of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma are elderly, in particular females, and not eligible for transplants.

Background &lt;p&gt;Paritaprevir inhibits organic anion–transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3, which transport bilirubin. Hyperbilirubinemia is an adverse event reported during hepatitis C treatment. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1/1B3. We evaluated whether the enhancement effect in gadoxetic acid–enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the plasma concentration of paritaprevir and might anticipate the development of hyperbilirubinemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This prospective study evaluated 27 patients with hepatitis C who underwent gadoxetic acid–enhanced MR imaging prior to treatment with ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement during the hepatobiliary phase, was assessed. Plasma trough concentrations, and concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after dosing were determined 7 d after the start of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven patients (26%) developed hyperbilirubinemia (≥ 1.6 mg/dl). Paritaprevir trough concentration (C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt;) was significantly higher in patients with hyperbilirubinemia than in those without (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022). We found an inverse relationship between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; (r = 0.612, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), while there was not a significantly weak inverse relationship between AUC&lt;sub&gt;0–6 h&lt;/sub&gt; and CEI (r = −0.338, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.085). The partial correlation coefficient between CEI and C&lt;sub&gt;trough&lt;/sub&gt; was −0.425 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.034), while excluding the effects of albumin and the FIB-4 index. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the CEI was relatively accurate in predicting hyperbilirubinemia, with area under the ROC of 0.882. Multivariate analysis showed that the CEI &amp;lt; 1.61 was the only independent predictor related to the development of hyperbilirubinemia, with an odds ratio of 9.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05–78.86, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Hepatic enhancement with gadoxetic acid was independently related to paritaprevir concentration and was an independent pretreatment factor in predicting hyperbilirubinemia.

Microorganisms respond to a variety of metabolic perturbations by repurposing or recruiting pathways to reroute metabolic flux and overcome the perturbation.

This study failed to identify mutations overcoming the need for CoA for thiamine synthesis in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;enterica panE&lt;/i&gt; mutants, suggesting that a more integrated approach may be necessary to uncover the mechanism connecting CoA and ThiC activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197703</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>4b2c7415</fingerprint><crawled>1526047621970</crawled><engagement>3</engagement><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1634f86c352:1beb5fa:3dd877af</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34423</originId><published>1525996800000</published><title>The transcriptomic and epigenetic map of vascular quiescence in the continuous lung endothelium</title><description>Maintenance of a quiescent and organotypically-differentiated layer of blood vessel-lining endothelial cells (EC) is vital for human health.

Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; genotypes from the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged.

High-throughput data generation platforms, like mass-spectrometry, microarrays, and second-generation sequencing are susceptible to batch effects due to run-to-run variation in reagents, equipment, protocols, or personnel. Currently, batch correction methods are not commonly applied to microbiome sequencing datasets. In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wj8NDMeglcg&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006102</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006102</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sean M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols.&lt;/p&gt; Design/Methodology/Approach &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing WASH/IPC activity data routinely recorded on paper forms or white boards at ETUs during the outbreak and later merged into a database from two IMC-run ETUs in Sierra Leone between December 2014 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult.

Oxygen is required for the completion of almost all known metazoan lifecycles, but many metazoans harbour abilities to withstand varying degrees and periods of hypoxia. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular model organism is extensively used as a model for the study of hypoxia and anoxia biology and it has been found that this nematode is capable of tolerance to varying degrees of hypoxia. Considering the extremely high diversity of nematodes, the effects of low oxygen concentration and mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen depletion differ among species. In this study, we used a simple assay to examine anoxia tolerance in four nematode species, including three free-living and one plant parasitic nematode.

While numerous papers have illuminated the worthiness of research collaboration, relatively few have addressed its prerequisites. In our study, seven prerequisites for research collaboration were extracted from the existing literature, and 460 student researchers were surveyed for their perceptions of the prerequisites’ importance. Focusing on voluntary research collaborations rather than brokered ones, it was found that socially oriented prerequisites such as reciprocal interactions, accountability, trust, and equality are perceived of more importance than prerequisites of psychical proximity, networking channels, and funds and material supplies (substance- and entity-related prerequisites). With latent regression analyses, we also found that Chinese and older, more experienced researchers are inclined to stress the importance of equality. Researchers of different cohorts prioritise substance- and entity-related prerequisites disparately. Specifically, Chinese researchers emphasise the necessity of funds, while researchers from first-tier universities place more value on networking channels. Disciplinary differences for the prerequisite of proximity were also discovered. Based on these results, discussion and implications were referred. Further suggestions on research collaboration studies are rendered.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527195600000</published><author><name>Sisi Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sisi Li, Chang Zhu, Shasha Li&lt;/p&gt;

Copy number variations (CNVs) are gain and loss of DNA sequence of a genome. High throughput platforms such as microarrays and next generation sequencing technologies (NGS) have been applied for genome wide copy number losses. Although progress has been made in both approaches, the accuracy and consistency of CNV calling from the two platforms remain in dispute. In this study, we perform a deep analysis on copy number losses on 254 human DNA samples, which have both SNP microarray data and NGS data publicly available from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project respectively. We show that the copy number losses reported from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genome Project only have &amp;lt; 30% overlap, while these reports are required to have cross-platform (e.g. PCR, microarray and high-throughput sequencing) experimental supporting by their corresponding projects, even though state-of-art calling methods were employed. On the other hand, copy number losses are found directly from HapMap microarray data by an accurate algorithm, i.e. CNVhac, almost all of which have lower read mapping depth in NGS data; furthermore, 88% of which can be supported by the sequences with breakpoint in NGS data. Our results suggest the ability of microarray calling CNVs and the possible introduction of false negatives from the unessential requirement of the additional cross-platform supporting. The inconsistency of CNV reports from Hapmap Project and 1000 Genomes Project might result from the inadequate information containing in microarray data, the inconsistent detection criteria, or the filtration effect of cross-platform supporting. The statistical test on CNVs called from CNVhac show that the microarray data can offer reliable CNV reports, and majority of CNV candidates can be confirmed by raw sequences. Therefore, the CNV candidates given by a good caller could be highly reliable without cross-platform supporting, so additional experimental information should be applied in need instead of necessarily.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Shuo Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shuo Li, Xialiang Dou, Ruiqi Gao, Xinzhou Ge, Minping Qian, Lin Wan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing tests (NGS) are usually performed on relatively small core biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples. Data is limited on what amount of tumor by volume or minimum number of FNA passes are needed to yield sufficient material for running NGS. We sought to identify the amount of tumor for running the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;2,723 consecutive tumor tissues of all cancer types were queried and reviewed for inclusion. Information on tumor volume, success of performing NGS, and results of NGS were compiled. Assessment of sequence analysis, mutation calling and sensitivity, quality control, drug associations, and data aggregation and analysis were performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;6.4% of samples were rejected from all testing due to insufficient tumor quantity. The number of genes with insufficient sensitivity make definitive mutation calls increased as the percentage of tumor decreased, reaching statistical significance below 5% tumor content. The number of drug associations also decreased with a lower percentage of tumor, but this difference only became significant between 1–3%. The number of drug associations did decrease with smaller tissue size as expected. Neither specimen size or percentage of tumor affected the ability to pass mRNA quality control. A tumor area of 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; provides a good margin of error for specimens to yield adequate drug association results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Specimen suitability remains a major obstacle to clinical NGS testing. We determined that PCR-based library creation methods allow the use of smaller specimens, and those with a lower percentage of tumor cells to be run on the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Scott Morris</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Scott Morris, Janakiraman Subramanian, Esma Gel, George Runger, Eric Thompson, David Mallery, Glen Weiss&lt;/p&gt;

The number of genes with insufficient sensitivity make definitive mutation calls increased as the percentage of tumor decreased, reaching statistical significance below 5% tumor content. The number of drug associations also decreased with a lower percentage of tumor, but this difference only became significant between 1–3%. The number of drug associations did decrease with smaller tissue size as expected. Neither specimen size or percentage of tumor affected the ability to pass mRNA quality control. A tumor area of 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; provides a good margin of error for specimens to yield adequate drug association results.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Specimen suitability remains a major obstacle to clinical NGS testing. We determined that PCR-based library creation methods allow the use of smaller specimens, and those with a lower percentage of tumor cells to be run on the PCDx NGS platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</link><crawled>1524850743729</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196556</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>f5d79d8</fingerprint><title>Rapid emergence of subaerial landmasses and onset of a modern hydrologic cycle 2.5 billion years ago</title><engagement>4</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-018-0131-1/MediaObjects/41586_2018_131_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>306</height><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1638dfdfa85:777018c:93d646dc</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid emergence of subaerial landmasses and onset of a modern hydrologic cycle 2.5 billion years ago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid emergence of subaerial landmasses and onset of a modern hydrologic cycle 2.5 billion years ago, Published online: 23 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0131-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0131-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The use of triple-oxygen-isotope data from continental shales spanning the past 3.7 billion years suggests that continental crust with near-modern average elevation and extent emerged about 2.5 billion years ago.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527058800000</published><author><name>I.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses.

Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>e66d5083</fingerprint><title>[ASAP] Repurposed HisC Aminotransferases Complete the Biosynthesis of Some Methanobactins</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00296/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00296t_0005.gif</url><height>227</height><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><id>8zDuXNfEmcUMGs/PlW1TOgRqhtBnaSfb4BWFOBdFCHM=_1634bc4e373:564126:abeb7260</id><published>1525924800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</href></item></canonical><author><name>Yun Ji Park, Grace E.

Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a serious complication during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Currently, the diagnosis of CI-AKI relies on serum creatinine (SCr) that is however affected by several limitations potentially leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. In this study we examined the diagnostic accuracy of a “bedside” measurement of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in the early detection of CI-AKI in 97 patients undergoing elective PCI. The overall incidence of CI-AKI was 3%. A significant positive correlation was observed between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI SCr (r = 0.339, p = 0.004) and a significant negative correlation between 6-hours NGAL and post-PCI CrCl (r = -0.303, p = 0.010). In patients with post-PCI SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl (median SCr absolute increase), delta NGAL 0–6 hours and 6-hours NGAL values were higher compared with patients with SCr elevation below the defined threshold (p = 0.049 and p = 0.056). The ROC analysis showed that a 6 hours NGAL value &gt; 96 ng/ml significantly predicted an absolute SCr increase &gt; 0.24 mg/dl after contrast exposure with sensitivity of 53% and specificity of 74% (AUC 0.819, 95% CI: 0.656 to 0.983, p = 0.005). The use of bedside NGAL assessment may significantly hasten diagnosis and treatment of CI-AKI, with remarkable clinical prognostic consequences.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><author><name>Annunziata Nusca</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Annunziata Nusca, Marco Miglionico, Claudio Proscia, Laura Ragni, Massimiliano Carassiti, Francesca Lassandro Pepe, Germano Di Sciascio&lt;/p&gt;

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006114</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006114</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

Consistent individual differences in behavioral tendencies (animal personality) can affect individual mate choice decisions. We asked whether personality traits affect male and female mate choice decisions similarly and whether potential personality effects are consistent across different mate choice situations. Using western mosquitofish (&lt;i&gt;Gambusia affinis&lt;/i&gt;) as our study organism, we characterized focal individuals (males and females) twice for boldness, activity, and sociability/shoaling and found high and significant behavioral repeatability. Additionally, each focal individual was tested in two different dichotomous mate choice tests in which it could choose between computer-animated stimulus fish of the opposite sex that differed in body size and activity levels, respectively. Personality had different effects on female and male mate choice: females that were larger than average showed stronger preferences for large-bodied males with increasing levels of boldness/activity (i.e., towards more proactive personality types). Males that were larger than average and had higher shoaling tendencies showed stronger preferences for actively swimming females. Size-dependent effects of personality on the strength of preferences for distinct phenotypes of potential mating partners may reflect effects of age/experience (especially in females) and social dominance (especially in males). Previous studies found evidence for assortative mate choice based on personality types or hypothesized the existence of behavioral syndromes of individuals’ choosiness across mate choice criteria, possibly including other personality traits. Our present study exemplifies that far more complex patterns of personality-dependent mate choice can emerge in natural systems.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526418000000</published><author><name>Bo-jian Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo-jian Chen, Kai Liu, Lin-jun Zhou, Guilherme Gomes-Silva, Carolin Sommer-Trembo, Martin Plath&lt;/p&gt;

South Africa has a Universal Test and Treat (UTT) policy in place to ensure that everyone tests for HIV and can access treatment if they test positive. The aim of this study is to document the pathways that older South Africans who are living with HIV take to access testing and treatment in this context. Despite the aging of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and clear evidence that testing older persons (over age 50) is necessary, very little is known about the circumstances under which older persons test for HIV or their motivations for doing so. In this study, we analyze 21 qualitative, in-depth interviews with women and men aged 50 and over who are living with HIV from two townships outside of Cape Town. Using grounded theory to specify emerging themes, we find similarities and differences between older men and women in their pathways to testing. Men primarily test for HIV when their spouse is diagnosed or in connection with TB testing and treatment. Older women, who are more likely to be widowed or divorced, often test for HIV only when they are symptomatic or not responding appropriately to care for non-communicable diseases. Most importantly, we find that older South Africans do not seek testing as a response to risk. Instead, older men and women test only once they are symptomatic and referred by a provider, or as a result of a partner’s status. Our respondents, particularly the women, expressed “shock” and confusion at learning they were HIV-positive because they do not see themselves as at risk of acquiring HIV. Because the benefits of UTT are greatest with early detection and treatment, older persons’ tendency to test at such a late stage of illness decreases the individual and population level advantages of UTT. More research is needed to understand older persons’ risk and testing behavior so that policy and programs include HIV testing messages that reach this population.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><author><name>Enid Schatz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enid Schatz, Lucia Knight&lt;/p&gt;

Genome-scale metabolic models have become the tool of choice for the global analysis of microorganism metabolism, and their reconstruction has attained high standards of quality and reliability. Improvements in this area have been accompanied by the development of some major platforms and databases, and an explosion of individual bioinformatics methods. Consequently, many recent models result from “à la carte” pipelines, combining the use of platforms, individual tools and biological expertise to enhance the quality of the reconstruction. Although very useful, introducing heterogeneous tools, that hardly interact with each other, causes loss of traceability and reproducibility in the reconstruction process. This represents a real obstacle, especially when considering less studied species whose metabolic reconstruction can greatly benefit from the comparison to good quality models of related organisms. This work proposes an adaptable workspace, AuReMe, for sustainable reconstructions or improvements of genome-scale metabolic models involving personalized pipelines. At each step, relevant information related to the modifications brought to the model by a method is stored. This ensures that the process is reproducible and documented regardless of the combination of tools used. Additionally, the workspace establishes a way to browse metabolic models and their metadata through the automatic generation of ad-hoc local wikis dedicated to monitoring and facilitating the process of reconstruction. AuReMe supports exploration and semantic query based on RDF databases. We illustrate how this workspace allowed handling, in an integrated way, the metabolic reconstructions of non-model organisms such as an extremophile bacterium or eukaryote algae. Among relevant applications, the latter reconstruction led to putative evolutionary insights of a metabolic pathway.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV3GF0mvv-g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1527109200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006146</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006146</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Méziane Aite, Marie Chevallier, Clémence Frioux, Camille Trottier, Jeanne Got, María Paz Cortés, Sebastián N.

Moreover, they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><author><name>yijiang@psych.ac.cn (Kepu Chen)</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32100</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>34910f6</fingerprint><title>A New Adsorption Rate Equation in Batch Systems</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-chemrxiv-7984736271254/11294447/thumb.png</url><height>354</height><width>250</width><contentType>image/png</contentType></visual><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163210d49c5:4936b2:93d646dc</id><published>1525219200000</published><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/A_New_Adsorption_Rate_Equation_in_Batch_Systems/6209984</originId><description>In

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526504400000</published><author><name>Eloise Pariset</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eloise Pariset, Catherine Pudda, François Boizot, Nicolas Verplanck, Frédéric Revol-Cavalier, Jean Berthier, Aurélie Thuaire, Vincent Agache&lt;/p&gt;

The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection. The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><author><name>Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nuno Gonçalo Ferreira Cordeiro, Jesus Dubert, Rita Nolasco, Eric Desmond Barton&lt;/p&gt;

The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197627</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>9b8aac84</fingerprint><title>Shewanella oneidensis as a living electrode for controlled radical polymerization [Microbiology]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1631d51f359:2877c61:fc1f8953</id><content><content>Metabolic engineering has facilitated the production of pharmaceuticals, fuels, and soft materials but is generally limited to optimizing well-defined metabolic pathways.

To cooperatively carry large food items to the nest, individual ants conform their efforts and coordinate their motion. Throughout this expedition, collective motion is driven both by internal interactions between the carrying ants and a response to newly arrived informed ants that orient the cargo towards the nest. During the transport process, the carrying group must overcome obstacles that block their path to the nest. Here, we investigate the dynamics of cooperative transport, when the motion of the ants is frustrated by a linear obstacle that obstructs the motion of the cargo. The obstacle contains a narrow opening that serves as the only available passage to the nest, and through which single ants can pass but not with the cargo. We provide an analytical model for the ant-cargo system in the constrained environment that predicts a bi-stable dynamic behavior between an oscillatory mode of motion along the obstacle and a convergent mode of motion near the opening. Using both experiments and simulations, we show how for small cargo sizes, the system exhibits spontaneous transitions between these two modes of motion due to fluctuations in the applied force on the cargo. The bi-stability provides two possible problem solving strategies for overcoming the obstacle, either by attempting to pass through the opening, or take large excursions to circumvent the obstacle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jPqnVrYLq7g&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006068</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan E.

Exosomes are endosome-derived membrane vesicles that contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The exosomal transcriptome mediates intercellular communication, and represents an understudied reservoir of novel biomarkers for human diseases. Next-generation sequencing enables complex quantitative characterization of exosomal RNAs from diverse sources. However, detailed protocols describing exosome purification for preparation of exosomal RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) libraries are lacking. Here we compared methods for isolation of exosomes and extraction of exosomal RNA from human cell-free serum, as well as strategies for attaining equal representation of samples within pooled RNA-Seq libraries. We compared commercial precipitation with ultracentrifugation for exosome purification and confirmed the presence of exosomes &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; both transmission electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Exosomal RNA extraction was compared using four different RNA purification methods. We determined the minimal starting volume of serum required for exosome preparation and showed that high quality exosomal RNA can be isolated from sera stored for over a decade. Finally, RNA-Seq libraries were successfully prepared with exosomal RNAs extracted from human cell-free serum, cataloguing both coding and non-coding exosomal transcripts. This method provides researchers with strategic options to prepare RNA-Seq libraries and compare RNA-Seq data quantitatively from minimal volumes of fresh and archival human cell-free serum for disease biomarker discovery.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><author><name>Emily N.

Most of the research studies developed applying microarray technology to the characterization of different pathological states of any disease may fail in reaching statistically significant results. This is largely due to the small repertoire of analysed samples, and to the limitation in the number of states or pathologies usually addressed. Moreover, the influence of potential deviations on the gene expression quantification is usually disregarded. In spite of the continuous changes in omic sciences, reflected for instance in the emergence of new Next-Generation Sequencing-related technologies, the existing availability of a vast amount of gene expression microarray datasets should be properly exploited. Therefore, this work proposes a novel methodological approach involving the integration of several heterogeneous skin cancer series, and a later multiclass classifier design. This approach is thus a way to provide the clinicians with an intelligent diagnosis support tool based on the use of a robust set of selected biomarkers, which simultaneously distinguishes among different cancer-related skin states. To achieve this, a multi-platform combination of microarray datasets from Affymetrix and Illumina manufacturers was carried out. This integration is expected to strengthen the statistical robustness of the study as well as the finding of highly-reliable skin cancer biomarkers. Specifically, the designed operation pipeline has allowed the identification of a small subset of 17 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from which to distinguish among 7 involved skin states. These genes were obtained from the assessment of a number of potential batch effects on the gene expression data. The biological interpretation of these genes was inspected in the specific literature to understand their underlying information in relation to skin cancer. Finally, in order to assess their possible effectiveness in cancer diagnosis, a cross-validation Support Vector Machines (SVM)-based classification including feature ranking was performed. The accuracy attained exceeded the 92% in overall recognition of the 7 different cancer-related skin states. The proposed integration scheme is expected to allow the co-integration with other state-of-the-art technologies such as RNA-seq.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><author><name>Juan Manuel Gálvez</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Manuel Gálvez, Daniel Castillo, Luis Javier Herrera, Belén San Román, Olga Valenzuela, Francisco Manuel Ortuño, Ignacio Rojas&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction and objectives &lt;p&gt;Progressive ataxic gait is a common symptom in individuals with Familial Dysautonomia (FD). At least 50% of adults with FD require assistance with walking. Our aims were to describe the medical condition of individuals with FD (ii) compare their gait characteristics to healthy individuals, and (iii) assess correlations between gait measures, presence of unstable gait pattern and frequency of falls.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twelve subjects with FD (7 males, age 25.3±10.6 years) and 16 healthy participants (6 males, age 35.9±11.9 years) were recruited. Gait kinematics, gait symmetry, dynamic muscle activity, and foot deep vibration sensation were recorded.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ataxic gait degrees were: severe (6 out of 12), moderate (4 out of 12) and low (2 out of 12). The number of falls correlated with base width asymmetry. Crouch gait was noted in 3 out of 12 of the subjects.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In-depth quantitative gait analysis of individuals with FD revealed ataxic gait. The ataxic pattern might be a result of combined neurological deficiencies and osseous deformities. Increasing the base of support of patients with FD might increase the symmetry of the base width during gait and decrease the number of falls. Additionally, perturbation treatment and dynamic balance exercises may be recommended in order to improve compensatory strategies. Future investigation of this population should include quantification of osseous rotations of the lower limb in order to fully understand its effect on their gait pattern and falls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Sigal Portnoy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sigal Portnoy, Channa Maayan, Jeanna Tsenter, Yonah Ofran, Vladimir Goldman, Nurit Hiller, Naama Karniel, Isabella Schwartz&lt;/p&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;It has been previously demonstrated that T lymphocytes may be involved in the development of hypertension and microvascular remodeling, and that circulating T effector lymphocytes may be increased in hypertension. In particular, Th1 and Th 17 lymphocytes may contribute to the progression of hypertension and microvascular damage while T-regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes seem to be protective in this regard. However, no data is available about patients with severe obesity, in which pronounced microvascular alterations were observed.&lt;/p&gt; Design and methods &lt;p&gt;We have investigated 32 severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, as well as 24 normotensive lean subjects and 12 hypertensive lean subjects undergoing an elective surgical intervention. A peripheral blood sample was obtained before surgery for assessment of CD4+ T lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocyte phenotype was evaluated by flow cytometry in order to assess T-effector and Treg lymphocytes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A marked reduction of several Treg subpopulations was observed in obese patients compared with controls, together with an increased in CD4+ effector memory T-effector cells.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In severely obese patients, Treg lymphocytes are clearly reduced and CD4+ effector memory cells are increased.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Factors associated with one-year mortality after recovery from critical illness are not well understood. Clinicians generally lack information regarding post-hospital discharge outcomes of patients from the intensive care unit, which may be important when counseling patients and families.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We sought to determine which factors among patients who survived for at least 30 days post-ICU admission are associated with one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all ICU patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical center from 2001–2012 who survived ≥30 days from ICU admission.

Among patients who survived to ≥30 days, 28,583 (88.2%) survived for greater than one year, whereas 3,837 (11.8%) did not. Variables associated with decreased one-year survival include: increased age, malignancy, number of hospital admissions within the prior year, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive agent use, sepsis, history of congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects. The unbinned likelihood methods used by Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; (2015) did not suffer from this problem.While a binned analysis might be favorable for simplicity and clarity of presentation, unbinned likelihood methods are preferable when effects might be somewhat subtle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Sherry Towers</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherry Towers, Anuj Mubayi, Carlos Castillo-Chavez&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58–216.21 ng g&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; (fat) range.

Background &lt;p&gt;Although many previous studies have examined the determinants of happiness in older adults, few have investigated the association between pension types and happiness. When compared to other conventional socioeconomic indicators, pension types may be more indicative of long-term socioeconomic status as they can reflect a person’s job history over their life course. This study examined the association between pension types and happiness in Japanese older people.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Cross-sectional survey data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study were used to analyze the association between pension types and happiness. The study population comprised 120152 participants from 2013. We calculated the prevalence ratios of happiness for the different pension types using Poisson regression models that controlled for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, wealth, education level, working status, occupation, depression, and social support.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) of happiness for no pension benefits, low pension benefits, and moderate pension benefits relative to high pension benefits were 0.77 (0.73–0.81), 0.95 (0.94–0.97), and 0.98 (0.97–0.99), respectively. However, the inclusion of depression as a covariate weakened the association between pension types and happiness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While pension types were associated with happiness after adjusting for other proxy measures of socioeconomic status, the association diminished following adjustment for depression.

The elastic net for generalized linear models is a popular regression and feature selection method, particularly useful when the number of features is greater than the sample size or when there exist many correlated predictor variables. This package provides a quantitative, cross-validation based toolkit to evaluate elastic net models and to uncover correlates contributing to prediction. Feature importance is evaluated by flexible criteria using out-of-bag prediction performance assessed via user-defined quality functions. Statistical significance is assigned to each model by comparison to null models generated by permutations of sample labels; analogous approaches are used to assess significance for the contribution of individual features to prediction.

This package provides a quantitative, cross-validation based toolkit to evaluate elastic net models and to uncover correlates contributing to prediction. Feature importance is evaluated by flexible criteria using out-of-bag prediction performance assessed via user-defined quality functions. Statistical significance is assigned to each model by comparison to null models generated by permutations of sample labels; analogous approaches are used to assess significance for the contribution of individual features to prediction. This package fits linear, binomial (logistic) and multinomial models, and provides a set of standard plots, summary statistics and output tables. eNetXplorer enables quantitative, exploratory analysis to generate hypotheses on which features may be associated with biological phenotypes of interest, such as in the identification of biomarkers for therapeutic responsiveness.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/30/305870</canonicalUrl><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305870v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1525139266920</crawled><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305870v1?rss=1</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/305870v1?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>be286cfc</fingerprint><title>Acute attenuation of fatigue after sodium bicarbonate supplementation does not manifest into greater training adaptations after 10-weeks of resistance training exercise</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525294800000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16321f524fe:64a183:93d646dc</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jason C.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;In two concurrent studies, we aimed to a) confirm the acute effect of 0.3 g·kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; body weight (BW) sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) supplementation on central and peripheral mechanisms associated with explosive power (Study 1) and b) determine whether chronic NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation would improve the adaptive response of the neuromuscular system during a 10-week resistance training program (Study 2).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Eight resistance trained participants volunteered after providing written consent. The experimental design consisted of a week of baseline testing, followed by ten weeks of training with progress measures performed in Week 5. Study 1 involved neuromuscular measurements before and after the leg extension portion of a power based training session performed in Week 1. Changes in maximal torque (MVT) and rates of torque development (RTD), along with other variables derived from femoral nerve stimulation (e.g. voluntary activation, neural recruitment) were analysed to determine the extent of fatigue under NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or placebo conditions. Changes in these same variables, coupled with functional 1-repetition maximum leg extension strength, were measured in Study 2 from baseline (Week 0) to Week 5, and again at Week 10.&lt;/p&gt; Results and conclusion &lt;p&gt;In Study 1, we observed a decline after the leg extension task in both MVT (~ 30%) and rates of torque production (RTD) irrespective of acid-base status, however the decline in maximal RTD (RTD&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;) was nearly 20% less in the NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; condition when compared to placebo (mean difference of 294.8 ± 133.4 Nm·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (95% CI -583.1 to -6.5 Nm, p &amp;lt; 0.05)). The primary finding in Study 2, however, suggests that introducing NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; repeatedly during a 10-week RT program does not confer any additional benefit to the mechanisms (and subsequent adaptive processes) related to explosive power production.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525294800000</published><author><name>Jason C.

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation. From a methodological point of view, the model we propose could be easily used to dynamically monitor the status of ecosystems, allowing the quick prediction of possible future scenarios, which is a crucial issue in biodiversity conservation decision-making.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><author><name>Jose María Gabriel y Galán</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jose María Gabriel y Galán, Antonio Murciano, Laure Sirvent, Abel Sánchez, James E.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524690000000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006043</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006043</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Falk Lieder, Amitai Shenhav, Sebastian Musslick, Thomas L.

The STM study combined with theoretical calculations shows that this plasmon-induced chemical reaction occurred by a direct intramolecular excitation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6388/521.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/521?rss=1</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Chemistry</item></keywords><author><name>Kazuma, E., Jung, J., Ueba, H., Trenary, M., Kim, Y.</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6388/521?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>17c8124c</fingerprint><title>A new approach to stabilize waste biomass for valorization using an oxidative process at 90 °C</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1524517200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162f39671b6:602bb9f:7d6c1c1c</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Takanori Itoh, Kazunori Iwabuchi, Kumpei Ota&lt;/p&gt;
This study aimed to establish a new methodology for upgrading biomass quality using low-temperature (below 100 °C) oxidation to achieve simultaneous drying and decomposition. Sterilized manure (63% wet basis) was heated at 90 °C for 49 days under an oxidative environment. The obtained solid and moisture reduction curves indicated that drying and decomposition proceeded simultaneously. The biomass was decomposed by oxidation with the release of water, carbon dioxide, and volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid. The oxidation process stopped when the biomass was dehydrated, indicating that the water originally present in the biomass governed the process. Elemental and calorific analyses revealed no remarkable increase in carbon content or increased heating value, and a slight decrease in oxygen content. Although the severity of the process was insufficient to produce an optimum solid fuel due to the low temperature used, the process would enable the stabilization of waste biomass with low energy consumption such as using waste heat.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524517200000</published><author><name>Takanori Itoh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takanori Itoh, Kazunori Iwabuchi, Kumpei Ota&lt;/p&gt;

Dietary intake of barley β-glucan (BG) is known to affect energy metabolism. However, its underlying mechanism remains poorly understood because studies have presented inconsistent results, with both positive and negative effects reported in terms of satiety, energy intake, weight loss, and glycemic control. The objective of this study was to clarify the physiological role underlying the metabolic benefits of barley BG using a mouse model of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Male 4-wk-old C57BL/6J mice were fed an HFD with 20% barley flour containing either high BG (HBG; 2% BG) or low BG (LBG; 0.6% BG) levels under conventional and germ-free (GF) conditions for 12 wks. In addition, mice were fed either an HFD with 5% cellulose (HFC; high fiber cellulose) or 5% barley BG (HFB; high fiber β-glucan) for 12 wks. Then, metabolic parameters, gut microbial compositions, and the production of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed. The weight gain and fat mass of HBG-fed mice were lower than those of control mice at 16-wk-old. Moreover, the secretion of the gut hormones PYY and GLP-1 increased in HBG-fed mice, thereby reducing food intake and improving insulin sensitivity by changing the gut microbiota and increasing SCFAs (especially, butyrate) under conventional condition. These effects in HBG-fed mice were abolished under GF conditions. Moreover, the HFB diets also increased PYY and GLP-1 secretion, and decreased food intake compared with that in HFC-fed mice. These results suggest that the beneficial metabolic effects of barley BG are primary due to the suppression of appetite and improvement of insulin sensitivity, which are induced by gut hormone secretion promoted via gut microbiota-produced SCFAs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Junki Miyamoto</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junki Miyamoto, Keita Watanabe, Satsuki Taira, Mayu Kasubuchi, Xuan Li, Junichiro Irie, Hiroshi Itoh, Ikuo Kimura&lt;/p&gt;

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><originId>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13526</originId><published>1525957661000</published><title>A New Method to Weigh Biomolecules</title><description>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

The red algal subclass Nemaliophycidae includes both marine and freshwater taxa that contribute to more than half of the freshwater species in Rhodophyta. Given that these taxa inhabit diverse habitats, the Nemaliophycidae is a suitable model for studying environmental adaptation. For this purpose, we characterized plastid genomes of two freshwater species, &lt;i&gt;Kumanoa americana&lt;/i&gt; (Batrachospermales) and &lt;i&gt;Thorea hispida&lt;/i&gt; (Thoreales), and one marine species &lt;i&gt;Palmaria palmata&lt;/i&gt; (Palmariales). Comparative genome analysis identified seven genes (&lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;46, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;91, &lt;i&gt;grx&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A) that were different among marine and freshwater species. Among currently available red algal plastid genomes (127), four genes (&lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;34, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;35, &lt;i&gt;ycf&lt;/i&gt;37) were retained in most of the marine species. Among these, the &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A gene, known for encoding heme oxygenase, had two additional copies (&lt;i&gt;HMOX1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HMOX2&lt;/i&gt;) that were newly discovered and were reported from previously red algal nuclear genomes. Each type of heme oxygenase had a different evolutionary history and special modifications (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., plastid targeting signal peptide). Based on this observation, we suggest that the plastid-encoded &lt;i&gt;pbs&lt;/i&gt;A contributes to the iron controlling system in iron-deprived conditions.

Ramie (&lt;i&gt;Boehmeria nivea&lt;/i&gt; L. Gaud) fiber, one of the most important natural fibers, is extracted from stem bark. Continuous cropping is the main obstacle to ramie stem growth and a major cause of reduced yields. Root-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant growth and health. In this study, we investigated differences between microbial communities in the soil of healthy and continuously cropped ramie plants, and sought to identify potential mechanisms whereby these communities could counteract the problems posed by continuous cropping. Paired-end Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and ITS gene amplicons was employed to study bacterial and fungal communities. Long-term monoculture of ramie significantly decreased fiber yields and altered soil microbial communities. Our findings revealed how microbial communities and functional diversity varied according to the planting year and plant health status. Soil bacterial diversity increased with the period of ramie monoculture, whereas no significant differences were observed for fungi. Sequence analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Acidobacteria&lt;/i&gt; were the most abundant bacterial phyla. &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt; abundance decreased with the period of ramie monoculture and correlated positively with the stem length, stem diameter, and fiber yield. The &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt; phyla exhibited a significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05) negative correlation with yields during continuous cultivation. Some &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt; members showed reduced microbial diversity, which prevented continuous ramie cropping. &lt;i&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/i&gt; were the main fungal phyla. The relatively high abundance of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; observed in healthy ramie may contribute to disease suppression, thereby promoting ramie growth. In summary, soil weakness and increased disease in ramie plants after long-term continuous cropping can be attributed to changes in soil microbes, a reduction in beneficial microbes, and an accumulation of harmful microbes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><author><name>Siyuan Zhu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Siyuan Zhu, Yanzhou Wang, Xiaomin Xu, Touming Liu, Duanqing Wu, Xia Zheng, Shouwei Tang, Qiuzhong Dai&lt;/p&gt;

The degradation of natural wetlands has significant effects on the ecosystem services they provide and the biodiversity they sustain. Under certain conditions, these negative effects can be mitigated by the presence of artificial wetlands. However, the conservation value of artificial wetlands needs to be explored further. In addition, it is unclear how certain anthropogenic variables, such as road networks and hunting reserves (i.e., areas where hunting of birds is prohibited) affect biodiversity in both artificial and natural wetlands. Here, we use data from thirteen artificial and six natural wetlands in Cyprus, to assess their similarities in bird species diversity and composition, and to quantify the relationship between species diversity and the density of road networks, hunting reserves, wetland size, and wetland depth. We found that while on average natural wetlands have more species and support higher abundances, certain artificial wetlands have the potential to support similarly diverse communities. Overall, regardless of the type, larger wetlands, with shallower waters tend to be more biodiverse. The same is true for wetlands surrounded by a higher percentage of hunting reserves and a lower density of road networks, albeit the effect of road networks was weaker. We conclude, from our results, that although the conservation value of natural wetlands is higher, artificial wetlands have the potential to play a complimentary role in the conservation of bird communities, assuming those wetlands have the right characteristics (e.g., in terms of size and depth) and assuming that the disturbances resulting from high-impact human-activities (e.g., hunting) are minimized.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Efthymia Giosa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Efthymia Giosa, Christos Mammides, Savvas Zotos&lt;/p&gt;

Monoamines and neuropeptides often modulate the same behavior, but monoaminergic-peptidergic crosstalk remains poorly understood. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, the adrenergic-like ligands, tyramine (TA) and octopamine (OA) require distinct subsets of neuropeptides in the two ASI sensory neurons to inhibit nociception. TA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-14&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;nlp-18&lt;/i&gt; from either synaptic/perisynaptic regions of ASI axons or the ASI soma, respectively, and OA selectively increases the release of ASI neuropeptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;nlp-9&lt;/i&gt; asymmetrically, from only the synaptic/perisynaptic region of the right ASI axon. The predicted amino acid preprosequences of genes encoding either TA- or OA-dependent neuropeptides differed markedly. However, these distinct preprosequences were not sufficient to confer monoamine-specificity and additional N-terminal peptide-encoding sequence was required. Collectively, our results demonstrate that TA and OA specifically and differentially modulate the release of distinct subsets of neuropeptides from different subcellular sites within the ASIs, highlighting the complexity of monoaminergic/peptidergic modulation, even in animals with a relatively simple nervous system.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><author><name>Tobias Clark</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tobias Clark, Vera Hapiak, Mitchell Oakes, Holly Mills, Richard Komuniecki&lt;/p&gt;

Collectively, our results demonstrate that TA and OA specifically and differentially modulate the release of distinct subsets of neuropeptides from different subcellular sites within the ASIs, highlighting the complexity of monoaminergic/peptidergic modulation, even in animals with a relatively simple nervous system.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</link><crawled>1525369512421</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196954</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>e6542e95</fingerprint><title>An optimized electroporation approach for efficient CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in murine zygotes</title><engagement>32</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525381200000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163271ba1e5:ec3ae9:5785ab88</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simon E.

Electroporation of zygotes represents a rapid alternative to the elaborate pronuclear injection procedure for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in mice. However, current protocols for electroporation either require the investment in specialized electroporators or corrosive pre-treatment of zygotes which compromises embryo viability. Here, we describe an easily adaptable approach for the introduction of specific mutations in C57BL/6 mice by electroporation of intact zygotes using a common electroporator with synthetic CRISPR/Cas9 components and minimal technical requirement. Direct comparison to conventional pronuclear injection demonstrates significantly reduced physical damage and thus improved embryo development with successful genome editing in up to 100% of living offspring. Hence, our novel approach for Easy Electroporation of Zygotes (EEZy) allows highly efficient generation of CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic mice while reducing the numbers of animals required.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525381200000</published><author><name>Simon E.

Multicellular spheroids generated through cellular self-assembly provide cytoarchitectural complexities of native tissue including three-dimensionality, extensive cell-cell contacts, and appropriate cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They are increasingly suggested as building blocks for larger engineered tissues to achieve shapes, organization, heterogeneity, and other biomimetic complexities. Application of these tissue culture platforms is of particular importance in cardiac research as the myocardium is comprised of distinct but intermingled cell types. Here, we generated scaffold-free 3D cardiac microtissue spheroids comprised of cardiac myocytes (CMs) and/or cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and used them as building blocks to form larger microtissues with different spatial distributions of CMs and CFs. Characterization of fusing homotypic and heterotypic spheroid pairs revealed an important influence of CFs on fusion kinetics, but most strikingly showed rapid fusion kinetics between heterotypic pairs consisting of one CF and one CM spheroid, indicating that CMs and CFs self-sort &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; into the intermixed morphology found in the healthy myocardium. We then examined electrophysiological integration of fused homotypic and heterotypic microtissues by mapping action potential propagation. Heterocellular elongated microtissues which recapitulate the disproportionate CF spatial distribution seen in the infarcted myocardium showed that action potentials propagate through CF volumes albeit with significant delay. Complementary computational modeling revealed an important role of CF sodium currents and the spatial distribution of the CM-CF boundary in action potential conduction through CF volumes. Taken together, this study provides useful insights for the development of complex, heterocellular engineered 3D tissue constructs and their engraftment via tissue fusion and has implications for arrhythmogenesis in cardiac disease and repair.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525208400000</published><author><name>Tae Yun Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tae Yun Kim, Celinda M.

The reliable assessment and management of avian pain is important in the context of animal welfare. Overtly expressed signs of pain vary substantially between and within species, strains and individuals, limiting the use of behaviour in pain studies. Similarly, physiological indices of pain can also vary and may be confounded by influence from non-painful stimuli. In mammals, changes in the frequency spectrum of the electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded under light anaesthesia (the minimal anaesthesia model; MAM) have been shown to reliably indicate cerebral responses to noxious stimuli in a range of species. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the MAM can be applied to the study of nociception in birds. Ten chickens were lightly anaesthetised with halothane and their EEG recorded using surface electrodes during the application of supramaximal mechanical, thermal and electrical noxious stimuli. Spectral analysis revealed no EEG responses to any of these stimuli. Given that birds possess the neural apparatus to detect and process pain, and that the applied noxious stimuli elicit behavioural signs of pain in conscious chickens, this lack of response probably relates to methodological limitations. Anatomical differences between the avian and mammalian brains, along with a paucity of knowledge regarding specific sites of pain processing in the avian brain, could mean that EEG recorded from the head surface is insensitive to changes in neural activity in the pain processing regions of the avian brain. Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524776400000</published><author><name>Amanda E.

Future investigations should examine alternative electrode placement sites, based on avian homologues of the mammalian brain regions involved in pain processing.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</link><crawled>1524764708124</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196454</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>356bfd1e</fingerprint><title>Research institutions must put the health of labs first</title><engagement>439</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05159-0/d41586-018-05159-0_15760946.jpg</url><height>576</height><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1636872fa35:40b0258:2835af05</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research institutions must put the health of labs first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research institutions must put the health of labs first, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05159-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05159-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Universities should take responsibility to ensure professional science is performed in an environment that is supportive, productive and rigorous.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526454000000</published><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05159-0</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research institutions must put the health of labs first&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research institutions must put the health of labs first, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05159-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05159-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Universities should take responsibility to ensure professional science is performed in an environment that is supportive, productive and rigorous.</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05159-0</link><crawled>1526465755701</crawled><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05159-0</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>4c996932</fingerprint><crawled>1526567029454</crawled><engagement>3</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1636e7c4ace:4b11760:2835af05</id><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37234</originId><published>1526515200000</published><title>Bundling up DNA</title><description>Structures known as chromocenters, comprising satellite DNA and proteins such as D1 or HMGA1, help to contain DNA inside the nucleus between cell divisions.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37234</canonicalUrl><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37234</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><summary><content>Structures known as chromocenters, comprising satellite DNA and proteins such as D1 or HMGA1, help to contain DNA inside the nucleus between cell divisions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><author><name>Susan_Gerbi@Brown.edu (Susan A Gerbi)</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37234</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>3b0d0cf1</fingerprint><title>Bayesian Estimation of 3D Chromosomal Structure from Single Cell Hi-C Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1633e704283:42445:93d646dc</id><content><content>The problem of 3D chromosome structure inference from Hi-C datasets is important and challenging.

Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and perinatal deaths. The aetiology of preeclampsia is largely unknown but a polygenetic component is assumed. To explore this hypothesis, we performed an in-depth whole-exome sequencing study in women with (cases, N = 50) and without (controls, N = 50) preeclampsia. The women were identified in an unselected cohort of 2,545 pregnant women based on data from the Danish National Patient Registry and the Medical Birth Registry. Matching DNA was obtained from a biobank containing excess blood from routine antenatal care visits. Novogene performed the whole-exome sequencing blinded to preeclampsia status. Variants for comparison between cases and controls were filtered in the Ingenuity Variant Analysis software. We applied two different strategies; a &lt;i&gt;disease association panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included variants in single genes associated with established clinical risk factors for preeclampsia, and a &lt;i&gt;gene panel&lt;/i&gt; approach, which included biological pathways harbouring genes previously reported to be associated with preeclampsia. Variant variability was compared in cases and controls at the level of biological processes, signalling pathways, and in single genes. Regardless of the applied strategy and the level of variability examined, we consistently found positive correlations between variant numbers in cases and controls (all R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;s&gt;0.88). Contrary to what was expected, cases carried fewer variants in biological processes and signalling pathways than controls (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-values ≤0.02). In conclusion, our findings challenge the hypothesis of a polygenetic aetiology for preeclampsia with a common network of susceptibility genes. The greater genetic diversity among controls may suggest a protective role of genetic diversity against the development of preeclampsia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526331600000</published><author><name>Anette Tarp Hansen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anette Tarp Hansen, Jens Magnus Bernth Jensen, Anne-Mette Hvas, Mette Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;

Urban economies are composed of diverse activities, embodied in labor occupations, which depend on one another to produce goods and services. Yet little is known about how the nature and intensity of these interdependences change as cities increase in population size and economic complexity. Understanding the relationship between occupational interdependencies and the number of occupations defining an urban economy is relevant because interdependence within a networked system has implications for system resilience and for how easily can the structure of the network be modified. Here, we represent the interdependencies among occupations in a city as a non-spatial information network, where the strengths of interdependence between pairs of occupations determine the strengths of the links in the network. Using those quantified link strengths we calculate a single metric of interdependence–or connectedness–which is equivalent to the density of a city’s weighted occupational network. We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525726800000</published><author><name>Shade T.

We then examine urban systems in six industrialized countries, analyzing how the density of urban occupational networks changes with network size, measured as the number of unique occupations present in an urban workforce. We find that in all six countries, density, or economic interdependence, increases superlinearly with the number of distinct occupations. Because connections among occupations represent flows of information, we provide evidence that connectivity scales superlinearly with network size in information networks.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</link><crawled>1525714747624</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196915</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>ba782ba1</fingerprint><title>Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1635dcfd639:2eca3f0:2835af05</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26012-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26012-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/3WH1uJxI0NA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526281200000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26012-4</href></item></canonical><author><name>Yoji Nagata</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26012-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26012-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Heart Failure Phenotypes Induced by Knockdown of DAPIT in Zebrafish: A New Insight into Mechanism of Dilated Cardiomyopathy&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/3WH1uJxI0NA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26012-4</link><crawled>1526287291961</crawled><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26012-4</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/3WH1uJxI0NA/s41598-018-26012-4</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>6143fcbe</fingerprint><title>Increased α-actinin-1 destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions and associates with poor prognosis in basal-like breast cancer</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1525899600000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3beda:2835af05</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

The controlled formation and stabilization of E-cadherin-based adhesions is vital for epithelial integrity. This requires co-operation between the E-cadherin-based adhesions and the associated actin cytoskeleton. In cancer, this co-operation often fails, predisposing cells to migration through molecular mechanisms that have only been partially characterized. Here, we demonstrate that the actin filament cross-linker α-actinin-1 is frequently increased in human breast cancer. In mammary epithelial cells, the increased α-actinin-1 levels promote cell migration and induce disorganized acini-like structures in Matrigel. This is accompanied by a major reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the associated E-cadherin-based adhesions. Increased expression of α-actinin-1 is particularly noted in basal-like breast cancer cell lines, and in breast cancer patients it associates with poor prognosis in basal-like subtypes. Downregulation of α-actinin-1 in E-cadherin expressing basal-like breast cancer cells demonstrate that α-actinin-1-assembled actin fibers destabilize E-cadherin-based adhesions. Taken together, these results indicate that increased α-actinin-1 expression destabilizes E-cadherin-based adhesions, which is likely to promote the migratory potential of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our results identify α-actinin-1 as a candidate prognostic biomarker in basal-like breast cancer.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Bianca Kovac</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Kovac, Tomi P.

Insect growth regulator insecticides mimic the action of hormones on the growth and development of insect pests. However, they can affect the development of non-target arthropods. In the present study, we tested the effects of the growth regulator insecticide fenoxycarb on several endpoints in the freshwater crustacean &lt;i&gt;Gammarus fossarum&lt;/i&gt; (Amphipoda). Females carrying embryos in their open brood pouch were exposed to 50 μg L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; fenoxycarb throughout the entire oogenesis (i.e. 21 days). After exposure, newborn individuals from exposed embryos were removed from the maternal open brood pouch for lipidomic analysis, while males were added to assess the reproductive success. After fertilization, the lipid profile, energy reserve content (lipids, proteins and glycogen), and activity of phenoloxidase − an enzyme involved in the immune response − were measured in females. No significant effect of fenoxycarb exposure was observed on the lipid profile of both newborn individuals and females, while reproductive success was severely impaired in exposed females. Particularly, precopulatory behavior was significantly reduced and fertilized eggs were unviable. This study highlighted the deleterious effects of the insect growth regulator fenoxycarb on gammarid reproduction, which could have severe repercussions on population dynamics.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524862800000</published><author><name>Hélène Arambourou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hélène Arambourou, Inmaculada Fuertes, Emmanuelle Vulliet, Gaëlle Daniele, Patrice Noury, Nicolas Delorme, Khedidja Abbaci, Carlos Barata&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to determine the origin of soybeans is an important issue following the inclusion of this information in the labeling of agricultural food products becoming mandatory in South Korea in 2017. This study was carried out to construct a prediction model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The optimal prediction models for discriminating soybean samples were obtained by selecting appropriate scaling methods, normalization methods, variable influence on projection (VIP) cutoff values, and wave-number regions. The factors for constructing the optimal partial-least-squares regression (PLSR) prediction model were using second derivatives, vector normalization, unit variance scaling, and the 4000–400 cm&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; region (excluding water vapor and carbon dioxide). The PLSR model for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybean samples had the best predictability when a VIP cutoff value was not applied. When Chinese soybean samples were identified, a PLSR model that has the lowest root-mean-square error of the prediction value was obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. The optimal PLSR prediction model for discriminating Korean soybean samples was also obtained using a VIP cutoff value of 1.5. This is the first study that has combined FT-IR spectroscopy with normalization methods, VIP cutoff values, and selected wave-number regions for discriminating Chinese and Korean soybeans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><author><name>Byeong-Ju Lee</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Byeong-Ju Lee, Yaoyao Zhou, Jae Soung Lee, Byeung Kon Shin, Jeong-Ah Seo, Doyup Lee, Young-Suk Kim, Hyung-Kyoon Choi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Quick background for those not in the field: a great many three-dimensional molecules can exist in right-handed and left-handed mirror-image forms (enantiomers), exactly like pairs of shoes. They have the property of “chirality”. When this happens with drug compounds, it’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/28/right-hand-left-hand-either-hand&quot;&gt;generally the case&lt;/a&gt; that the two have different activities, because proteins in the body are chiral, too. Where that handedness comes from is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/12/15/chirality-from-chemical-supply-houses-to-life-as-we-know-it&quot;&gt;rather deep question&lt;/a&gt;. Separating enantiomers is generally done by using another chiral substance (making derivatives or salts of the parent compound or passing across a purification column loaded with some chiral solid phase].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a number of proposals in this vein, although it’s a minefield of subtlety (and of irreproducible experiments). But there are some &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/24/a_new_way_to_determine_chirality&quot;&gt;electromagnetic effects&lt;/a&gt; that are both theoretically feasible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/05/enantioselectivity-with-microwaves&quot;&gt;experimentally real&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2018/05/09/science.aar4265.full&quot;&gt;this new paper&lt;/a&gt; seems to be another one. The paper starts off, I should note, with a brief history on the intersection of chirality and magnetism, a topic that involved heavy hitters like Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Pierre Curie in its early days. During my own career, I well recall reports of chiral induction in magnetic fields that had to be retracted to much embarrassment, so it does take some bravery to venture into this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors, a multicenter team from Israel, the US, Germany, and Poland, are taking advantage of a phenomenon called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Simply put – and I’m not going to be able to put it at a much higher level – electron movement through molecules is affected by their chirality. And that means that charge distribution in two enantiomers has different spin polarization in each one. That led the group to wonder about the interaction of chiral molecules with perpendicularly-magnetized surfaces, which have been the subject of much research in thin-film “spintronic” applications. In theory, one enantiomer could be attracted to such a surface much more than the other, depending on the direction of the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s just what happens. They picked a test helical polyalanine peptide and a gold-layered ferromagnet film (the gold is to protect it from oxidation, and the behavior of the exact peptide on gold layers had already been studied in other contexts). Attaching nanoparticles to the peptide (for visualization) and exposing these to the surface showed (by electron microscopy) a dramatic difference based on the direction of the perpendicular magnetic field. In one direction, the particles stick, and in the other they don’t. If the magnetization is in-plane (instead of perpendicular), there’s no difference, and there’s no difference if you’re applying an external magnetic field instead. It has to be a field associated with the thin layer, and it has to be in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also prepared a 50/50 mix of D- and L-peptides, and this (as it should) shows no circular dichroism. But after multiple exposures to fresh magnetic surfaces, the solution was clearly enriched in one enantiomer, and began to show circular dichroism as expected, increasing with the number of exposures. They then set this up as a flow experiment, and the results were unmistakeable: flowing an an enantiomeric mixture of two peptides down an unmagnetized column gave the same racemic mixture out the other end. But when the surface was magnetized “perpendicular down”, they got a strong CD spectrum from the eluent, and when it was magnetized “perpendicular up”, they got the mirror-image CD spectrum: the other enantiomer. The D enantiomers interact with the down-magnetized surfaces and the L enantiomers with the up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just peptides, either. A DNA oligomer was shown to bind to one magnetization and not the other, and the effect was reproduced with the single amino acid cysteine. In each case the kinetics are different for different sorts of molecules, different at various concentrations, and different between the enantiomers. The system thus has to be tuned for the best separation, but the effect is real across all of them. And that immediately suggests a whole new kind of chromatography:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules with a magnetic substrate, presented in this article, provides a potentially generic chromatographic method for enantioseparation, which does not require a specific separating column. Because the observed effect depends on the electrical polarizability of the system (that is accompanied by spin polarization) and because this polarization depends on the global structure of the chiral molecule, the method described here may also allow the separation of chiral molecules from a mixture of molecules, either chiral or achiral. In addition, this technique could potentially be applied for separating chiral molecules based on their secondary structure and/or for separating two secondary structures of the same chiral molecule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would appear that a completely new analytical method has been invented, and I very much look forward to seeing what can be made out of it. We’re going to have to learn to think about chiral separations in a completely different way than we’re used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525899600000</published><author><name>Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

The bionematicidal effect of a synthetic volatile mixture (SVM) of four volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;Daldinia cf&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;concentrica&lt;/i&gt; against the devastating plant-parasitic root-knot nematode &lt;i&gt;Meloidogyne javanica&lt;/i&gt; has been recently demonstrated in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and greenhouse experiments. However, the mode of action governing the observed irreversible paralysis of J2 larvae upon exposure to SVM is unknown. To unravel the mechanism underlying the anthelmintic and nematicidal activities, we used the tractable model worm &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; was also susceptible to both the fungal VOCs and SVM. Among compounds comprising SVM, 3-methyl-1-butanol, (±)-2-methyl-1-butanol, and 4-heptanone showed significant nematicidal activity toward L1, L4 and young adult stages. Egg hatching was only negatively affected by 4-heptanone. To determine the mechanism underlying this activity, we examined the response of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; mutants for glutamate-gated chloride channel and acetylcholine transporter, targets of the nematicidal drugs ivermectin and aldicarb, respectively, to 4-heptanone and SVM. These aldicarb- and ivermectin-resistant mutants retained susceptibility upon exposure to 4-heptanone and SVM. Next, we used &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; TJ356 strain &lt;i&gt;zIs356 (daf-16&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, LD1 &lt;i&gt;ldIs7&lt;/i&gt; [&lt;i&gt;skn-1B/C&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP + pRF4&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;rol-6&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;su1006&lt;/i&gt;))], LD1171 &lt;i&gt;ldIs3 [gcs-1p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;gfp; rol-6(su1006))]&lt;/i&gt;, CL2166 &lt;i&gt;dvIs19 (gst-4p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP)&lt;/i&gt; and CF1553 &lt;i&gt;muIs84 (sod-3p&lt;/i&gt;::&lt;i&gt;GFP+rol-6)&lt;/i&gt;, which have mutations in genes regulating multiple stress responses. Following exposure of L4 larvae to 4-heptanone or SVM, there was clear nuclear translocation of DAF-16::GFP, and SKN-1::GFP indicating that their susceptibility involves DAF-16 and SKN1 regulation. Application of 4-heptanone, but not SVM, induced increased expression of, &lt;i&gt;gcs-1&lt;/i&gt;::GFP and &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt;::GFP compared to controls.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is increasingly being used to treat rapidly progressing or severe cardiogenic shock. However, it has been repeatedly shown that increased afterload associated with ECLS significantly diminishes left ventricular (LV) performance. The objective of the present study was to compare LV function and coronary flow during standard continuous-flow ECLS support and electrocardiogram (ECG)-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sixteen female swine (mean body weight 45 kg) underwent ECLS implantation under general anesthesia and artificial ventilation. Subsequently, acute cardiogenic shock, with documented signs of tissue hypoperfusion, was induced by initiating global myocardial hypoxia. Hemodynamic cardiac performance variables and coronary flow were then measured at different rates of continuous or pulsatile ECLS flow (ranging from 1 L/min to 4 L/min) using arterial and venous catheters, a pulmonary artery catheter, an LV pressure-volume loop catheter, and a Doppler coronary guide-wire.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Myocardial hypoxia resulted in declines in mean cardiac output to 1.7±0.7 L/min, systolic blood pressure to 64±22 mmHg, and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) to 22±7%. Synchronized pulsatile flow was associated with a significant reduction in LV end-systolic volume by 6.2 mL (6.7%), an increase in LV stroke volume by 5.0 mL (17.4%), higher LVEF by 4.5% (18.8% relative), cardiac output by 0.37 L/min (17.1%), and mean arterial pressure by 3.0 mmHg (5.5%) when compared with continuous ECLS flow at all ECLS flow rates (P&amp;lt;0.05). At selected ECLS flow rates, pulsatile flow also reduced LV end-diastolic pressure, end-diastolic volume, and systolic pressure. ECG-synchronized pulsatile flow was also associated with significantly increased (7% to 22%) coronary flow at all ECLS flow rates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;ECG-synchronized pulsatile ECLS flow preserved LV function and coronary flow compared with standard continuous-flow ECLS in a porcine model of cardiogenic shock.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1524603600000</published><author><name>Petr Ostadal</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Petr Ostadal, Mikulas Mlcek, Holger Gorhan, Ivo Simundic, Svitlana Strunina, Matej Hrachovina, Andreas Krüger, Dagmar Vondrakova, Marek Janotka, Pavel Hala, Martin Mates, Martin Ostadal, James C.

Testudinid herpesviruses (TeHVs) have a worldwide distribution among tortoises. However, information such as risk factors promoting the occurrence or the recrudescence of the associated disease and the mid-term sequelae of an outbreak comprising the extent and dynamic of the viral shedding have been only minimally investigated. Critical management information is also lacking or anecdotal. Furthermore, major aspects of the viral pathogenesis including the likelihood of vertical transmission of the virus are virtually unknown. The present study describes the occurrence and the management of an outbreak of &lt;i&gt;Testudinid herpesvirus&lt;/i&gt; genotype 3 (TeHV3) in a large, private collection of chelonians. Clinical, pathological, molecular and serological characterization of the outbreak were carried out. Seventy-five percent of the infected tortoises died. Complementation of molecular and serological testing was a critical point for successful management implementations. A case-control study was performed to analyze possible risk factors associated with the infection. Furthermore, a subgroup of six asymptomatic infected tortoises was monitored for two consecutive seasons after the outbreak: all the infected tortoises were determined to be intermittent shedders, except one, which was a persistent shedder. Post-hibernation was associated with the highest number of shedders. Finally, evidence of the most likely vertical transmission of the virus was obtained for the first time.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525986000000</published><author><name>Maria Luisa Marenzoni</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Luisa Marenzoni, Lorenzo Santoni, Andrea Felici, Carmen Maresca, Valentina Stefanetti, Monica Sforna, Maria Pia Franciosini, Patrizia Casagrande Proietti, Francesco Carlo Origgi&lt;/p&gt;

Sulphonylurea drugs stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells primarily by inhibiting ATP sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in the β-cell membrane. The effective sulphonylurea concentration at its site of action is significantly attenuated by binding to serum albumin, which makes it difficult to compare &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data. We therefore measured the ability of gliclazide and glibenclamide to inhibit K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of serum albumin. We used this data, together with estimates of free drug concentrations from binding studies, to predict the extent of sulphonylurea inhibition of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels at therapeutic concentrations &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents from mouse pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes were measured using the patch-clamp technique. Gliclazide and glibenclamide binding to human plasma were determined in spiked plasma samples using an ultrafiltration-mass spectrometry approach. Bovine serum albumin (60g/l) produced a mild, non-significant reduction of gliclazide block of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; currents in pancreatic β-cells and &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. In contrast, glibenclamide inhibition of recombinant K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels was dramatically suppressed by albumin (predicted free drug concentration &amp;lt;0.1%). Insulin secretion was also reduced. Free concentrations of gliclazide and glibenclamide in the presence of human plasma measured in binding experiments were 15% and 0.05%, respectively. Our data suggest the free concentration of glibenclamide in plasma is too low to account for the drug’s therapeutic effect.

In contrast, the free gliclazide concentration in plasma is high enough to close K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels and stimulate insulin secretion.</description><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</originId><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197634</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>da6a5b19</fingerprint><title>Critical-depth Raman spectroscopy enables home-use non-invasive glucose monitoring</title><engagement>0</engagement><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><updated>1526072400000</updated><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f78:2835af05</id><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Signe M.

One of the most ambitious endeavors in the field of diabetes technology is non-invasive glucose sensing. In the past decades, a number of different technologies have been assessed, but none of these have found its entry into general clinical use. We report on the development of a table-top confocal Raman spectrometer that was used in the home of patients with diabetes and operated for extended periods of time unsupervised and without recalibration. The system is based on measurement of glucose levels at a ‘critical depth’ in the skin, specifically in the interstitial fluid located below the stratum corneum but above the underlying adipose tissue layer. The region chosen for routine glucose measurements was the base of the thumb (the thenar). In a small clinical study, 35 patients with diabetes analyzed their interstitial fluid glucose for a period of 60 days using the new critical-depth Raman (CD-Raman) method and levels were correlated to reference capillary blood glucose values using a standard finger-stick and test strip product. The calibration of the CD-Raman system was stable for &gt; 10 days. Measurement performance for glucose levels present at, or below, a depth of ~250μm below the skin surface was comparable to that reported for currently available invasive continuous glucose monitors. In summary, using the CD-Raman technology we have demonstrated the first successful use of a non-invasive glucose monitor in the home.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526072400000</published><author><name>Signe M.

These findings indicate large, coordinated changes in molecular machinery of forebrain precursors during early brain development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><author><name>maria.lehtinen@childrens.harvard.edu (Anoop K Sendamarai)</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36998</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>7b2a899e</fingerprint><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7d5:93d646dc</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</originId><published>1525974002000</published><title>Giving a hand to metamaterials</title><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/615.14.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Engineering, Materials Science</item></keywords><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/615-n?rss=1</href></item></alternate></item><item><fingerprint>6fed3bc2</fingerprint><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><engagement>0</engagement><visual><url>none</url></visual><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce962:3dd877af</id><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/854?rss=1</originId><published>1527183688000</published><title>Enhancing energy transport in conjugated polymers</title><unread>True</unread><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/854.full</canonicalUrl><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/854?rss=1</link><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Materials Science</item></keywords><author><name>Holmes, R.

The ability to express a gene of interest in a spatio-temporal manner using Gal4-UAS system has allowed the use of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model to study various biological phenomenon. During &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; eye development, a synchronous wave of differentiation called Morphogenetic furrow (MF) initiates at the posterior margin resulting in differentiation of retinal neurons. This synchronous differentiation is also observed in the differentiating retina of vertebrates. Since MF is highly dynamic, it can serve as an excellent model to study patterning and differentiation. However, there are not any Gal4 drivers available to observe the gain- of- function or loss- of- function of a gene specifically along the dynamic MF. The &lt;i&gt;decapentaplegic (dpp)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a secreted protein of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily that expresses at the posterior margin and then moves with the MF. However, unlike the MF associated pattern of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene expression, the targeted &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver expression is restricted to the posterior margin of the developing eye disc. We screened GMR lines harboring regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; fused with Gal4 coding region to identify MF specific enhancer of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; using a GFP reporter gene. We employed immuno-histochemical approaches to detect gene expression. The rationale was that GFP reporter expression will correspond to the &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; expression domain in the developing eye. We identified two new &lt;i&gt;dpp-&lt;/i&gt;Gal4 lines, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 and &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 that carry sequences from first intron region of &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression along the MF during development and later in the entire pupal retina whereas &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 drives expression of GFP transgene in the entire developing eye disc, which later drives expression only in the ventral half of the pupal retina. Thus, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 will serve as a new reagent for targeting gene expression in the ventral half of the pupal retina. We compared misexpression phenotypes of Wg, a negative regulator of eye development, using &lt;i&gt;GMR17E04&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4, &lt;i&gt;GMR18D08&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 with existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver. The eye phenotypes generated by using our newly identified MF specific driver are not similar to the ones generated by existing &lt;i&gt;dpp&lt;/i&gt;-Gal4 driver.

Repeated concussion is becoming increasingly recognized as a serious public health concern around the world. Moreover, there is a greater awareness amongst health professionals of the potential for repeated pediatric concussions to detrimentally alter the structure and function of the developing brain. To better study this issue, we developed an awake closed head injury (ACHI) model that enabled repeated concussions to be performed reliably and reproducibly in juvenile rats. A neurological assessment protocol (NAP) score was generated immediately after each ACHI to help quantify the cumulative effects of repeated injury on level of consciousness, and basic motor and reflexive capacity. Here we show that we can produce a repeated ACHI (4 impacts in two days) in both male and female juvenile rats without significant mortality or pain. We show that both single and repeated injuries produce acute neurological deficits resembling clinical concussion symptoms that can be quantified using the NAP score. Behavioural analyses indicate repeated ACHI acutely impaired spatial memory in the Barnes maze, and an interesting sex effect was revealed as memory impairment correlated moderately with poorer NAP score performance in a subset of females. These cognitive impairments occurred in the absence of motor impairments on the Rotarod, or emotional changes in the open field and elevated plus mazes. Cresyl violet histology and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that repeated ACHI did not produce significant structural damage. MRI also confirmed there was no volumetric loss in the cortex, hippocampus, or corpus callosum of animals at 1 or 7 days post-ACHI. Together these data indicate that the ACHI model can provide a reliable, high throughput means to study the effects of concussions in juvenile rats.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525813200000</published><author><name>Alicia Meconi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alicia Meconi, Ryan C.

We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery.

In the past two decades since its disclosure, great strides have been made to expand the toolbox of reaction modes that are compatible with the idiosyncratic aqueous, dilute, and DNA-sensitive parameters of this system.

In the past two decades since its disclosure, great strides have been made to expand the toolbox of reaction modes that are compatible with the idiosyncratic aqueous, dilute, and DNA-sensitive parameters of this system. However, construction of highly important C(sp3)-C(sp3) linkages on DNA through cross-coupling remains unexplored.

&lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; is a cell-cycle regulator. &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; has been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, but few researchers have studied &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; in shrimps. We cloned &lt;i&gt;Chk1&lt;/i&gt; from the black tiger shrimp (&lt;i&gt;Penaeus monodon&lt;/i&gt;). The full-length cDNA sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; had 3,334 base pairs (bp), with an open reading frame of 1,455 bp. The complete genomic sequence of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; (11,081 bp) contained 10 exons separated by nine introns. qRT-PCR showed that &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; was highly expressed in the ovaries and gills of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression was noted in stage III of ovarian development in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression decreased significantly after injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and eyestalk ablation in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;monodon&lt;/i&gt; ovaries.

The localization and level of &lt;i&gt;PmChk1&lt;/i&gt; expression in the hepatopancreas was studied using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, which showed that data were in accordance with those of qRT-PCR.

During the development of the visual system, high levels of energy are expended propelling axons from the retina to the brain. However, the role of intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism in the development of the visual system has been overlooked. Here, we report that the carbohydrate metabolites succinate and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and their respective receptor—GPR91 and GPR99—are involved in modulating retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections toward the thalamus during visual system development. Using ex vivo and in vivo approaches, combined with pharmacological and genetic analyses, we revealed that GPR91 and GPR99 are expressed on axons of developing RGCs and have complementary roles during RGC axon growth in an extracellular signal–regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;)-dependent manner. However, they have no effects on axon guidance. These findings suggest an important role for these receptors during the establishment of the visual system and provide a foundational link between carbohydrate metabolism and axon growth.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/N_QnsknNcYM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003619</href></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003619</originId><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hosni Cherif, François Duhamel, Bruno Cécyre, Alex Bouchard, Ariane Quintal, Sylvain Chemtob, Jean-François Bouchard&lt;/p&gt;
