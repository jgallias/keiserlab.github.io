&lt;i&gt;Edwardsiella ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod and the causative agent of enteric septicemia of channel catfish (ESC), which is one of the most prevalent diseases of catfish, causing significant economic losses in the catfish industry. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; is resistant to complement system and macrophage killing, which results in rapid systemic septicemia. However, mechanisms of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses under conditions of host environment are not studied well. Therefore, in this work, we report &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses during hydrogen peroxide, low pH, and catfish serum stresses as well as during catfish invasion. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ictaluri&lt;/i&gt; stress responses were characterized by identifying expression of 13 universal stress protein (USP) genes (&lt;i&gt;usp01&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;usp13&lt;/i&gt;) and seven USP-interacting protein genes (&lt;i&gt;groEL&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;groES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dnaK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;clpB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grpE&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;).

Background &lt;p&gt;Initiated in 2016, &lt;i&gt;End Hep C SF&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive initiative to eliminate hepatitis C (HCV) infection in San Francisco. The introduction of direct-acting antivirals to treat and cure HCV provides an opportunity for elimination. To properly measure progress, an estimate of baseline HCV prevalence, and of the number of people in various subpopulations with active HCV infection, is required to target and measure the impact of interventions. Our analysis was designed to incorporate multiple relevant data sources and estimate HCV burden for the San Francisco population as a whole, including specific key populations at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Our estimates are based on triangulation of data found in case registries, medical records, observational studies, and published literature from 2010 through 2017. We examined subpopulations based on sex, age and/or HCV risk group. When multiple sources of data were available for subpopulation estimates, we calculated a weighted average using inverse variance weighting. Credible ranges (CRs) were derived from 95% confidence intervals of population size and prevalence estimates.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We estimate that 21,758 residents of San Francisco are HCV seropositive (CR: 10,274–42,067), representing an overall seroprevalence of 2.5% (CR: 1.2%– 4.9%). Of these, 16,408 are estimated to be viremic (CR: 6,505–37,407), though this estimate includes treated cases; up to 12,257 of these (CR: 2,354–33,256) are people who are untreated and infectious. People who injected drugs in the last year represent 67.9% of viremic HCV infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We estimated approximately 7,400 (51%) more HCV seropositive cases than are included in San Francisco’s HCV surveillance case registry.

Rhizobacteria associated with crops constitute an important source of potentially beneficial microorganisms with plant growth promoting activity or antagonistic effects against phytopathogens. In this study, we evaluated the plant growth promoting activity of 11 bacterial isolates that were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees and from that of avocado trees having survived root rot infestations. Seven bacterial isolates, belonging to the genera &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, promoted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; growth of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;. These isolates were then tested for antagonistic activity against &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, in direct dual culture assays. Two of those rhizobacterial isolates, obtained from symptomatic-declining trees, displayed antagonistic activity. Isolate A8a, which is closely related to &lt;i&gt;Bacillus acidiceler&lt;/i&gt;, was also able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; by 76% through the production of volatile compounds. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) allowed to tentatively identify the main volatiles emitted by isolate A8a as 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine, 6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-2-one and 3-amino-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one. These volatile compounds have been reported to show antifungal activity when produced by other bacterial isolates. These results confirm the significance of rhizobacteria and suggest that these bacteria could be used for biocontrol of soil borne oomycetes through their volatiles emissions.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Alfonso Méndez-Bravo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194665</canonicalUrl><engagement>63</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37bc:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>b5a3221c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfonso Méndez-Bravo, Elvis Marian Cortazar-Murillo, Edgar Guevara-Avendaño, Oscar Ceballos-Luna, Benjamín Rodríguez-Haas, Ana L.

Heparan sulfate 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfotransferases (HS3STs) catalyze the final maturation step of heparan sulfates. Although seven HS3ST isozymes have been described in human, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfation is a relatively rare modification, and only a few biological processes have been described to be influenced by 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulfated motifs. A conflicting literature has recently reported that HS3ST2, 3A, 3B and 4 may exhibit either tumor-promoting or anti-oncogenic properties, depending on the model used and cancer cell phenotype. Hence, we decided to compare the consequences of the overexpression of each of these HS3STs in the same cellular model. We demonstrated that, unlike HS3ST3A, the other three isozymes enhanced the proliferation of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells. Moreover, the colony forming capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was markedly increased by the expression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4. No notable difference was observed between the three isozymes, meaning that the modifications catalyzed by each HS3ST had the same functional impact on cell behavior. We then demonstrated that overexpression of HS3ST2, 3B and 4 was accompanied by increased activation of c-Src, Akt and NF-κB and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and XIAP. In line with these findings, we showed that HS3ST-transfected cells are more resistant to cell death induction by pro-apoptotic stimuli or NK cells. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that HS3ST2, 3B and 4 share the same pro-tumoral activity and support the idea that these HS3STs could compensate each other for loss of their expression depending on the molecular signature of cancer cells and/or changes in the tumor environment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Charles Hellec</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194676</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849f3:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>1c7c6408</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Charles Hellec, Maxime Delos, Mathieu Carpentier, Agnès Denys, Fabrice Allain&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Inequalities in health among groups of various socio-economic status (as measured by education, occupation, and income) constitute one of the main challenges for public health. Since 2006, the Lazio Regional Outcome Evaluation Program (P.Re.Val.E.), presents a set of indicators of hospital performance based on quality standards driven by strong clinical recommendations, and measures the variation in the access to effective health care for different population groups and providers in the Lazio Region. One of the aims of the program was to compare population subgroups in order to promote equity in service provision. Since June 2013, a new management strategy has been put in place that assigned specific goals based on performance assessment to the chief executive officers of the hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether, in recent years, there has been a reduction in the differential access to effective health care, among individuals with different educational levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled all patients discharged from both public and private hospitals of the Lazio region between 2012 and 2015, living in Lazio region. We analysed the proportion of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes (primary PCI), the proportion of patients with hip fracture (HF) who underwent surgery within 2 days, and the proportion of women with primary C-section. We applied multivariate logistic regression models to assess the effect of educational level on health outcomes, adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities that could affect the outcomes. For each year of the study period, we compared adjusted proportions of outcomes for the highest and the lowest level of education by using percentage differences.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, 44.6% of STEMI patients (N = 3,299) were treated with primary PCI, 54.4% of patients with hip fractures (N = 6,602) underwent surgery within 2 days, and 27.7% of women without a previous C-section (N = 34,718) delivered via C-section, in 2015. The corresponding proportions in 2012 were 27.8%, 31.3% and 31.5%, respectively. By comparing the adjusted proportions in patients with the highest education level (a university degree or higher) to those with the lowest level education level (None/Primary school), a decrease in the percentage difference was observed during the study period. In STEMI and delivery cohorts, the improvement of outcomes involved the least and the most educated patients, respectively, and the difference between the two educational levels was close to zero in 2015, whereas for hip patients, the improvement was more evident among the less educated patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In the Lazio region, we observed a reduction in the differential access to effective heath care by educational level, in different clinical areas. Different factors might explain these results. On top of the public disclosure of outcome data, the management strategy applied in mid-2013 might have driven the overall improvement of the health system for the considered conditions, helping to achieve a fairer access to health.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Martina Ventura</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194972</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1b:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>bf9aff61</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Ventura, Danilo Fusco, Katia Bontempi, Paola Colais, Marina Davoli&lt;/p&gt;

Soil respiration induced by biological soil crusts (BSCs) is an important process in the carbon (C) cycle in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, where vascular plants are restricted by the harsh environment, particularly the limited soil moisture. However, the interaction between temperature and soil respiration remains uncertain because of the number of factors that control soil respiration, including temperature and soil moisture, especially in BSC-dominated areas. In this study, the soil respiration in moss-dominated crusts and lichen-dominated crusts was continuously measured using an automated soil respiration system over a one-year period from November 2015 to October 2016 in the Shapotou region of the Tengger Desert, northern China. The results indicated that over daily cycles, the half-hourly soil respiration rates in both types of BSC-covered areas were commonly related to the soil temperature. The observed diel hysteresis between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature in the BSC-covered areas was limited by nonlinearity loops with semielliptical shapes, and soil temperature often peaked later than the half-hourly soil respiration rates in the BSC-covered areas. The average lag times between the half-hourly soil respiration rates and soil temperature for both types of BSC-covered areas were two hours over the diel cycles, and they were negatively and linearly related to the volumetric soil water content. Our results highlight the diel hysteresis phenomenon that occurs between soil respiration rates and soil temperatures in BSC-covered areas and the negative response of this phenomenon to soil moisture, which may influence total C budget evaluations. Therefore, the interactive effects of soil temperature and moisture on soil respiration in BSC-covered areas should be considered in global carbon cycle models of desert ecosystems.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Chao Guan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195606</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd085:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>e6b1c326</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guan, Xinrong Li, Peng Zhang, Yongle Chen&lt;/p&gt;

P5B ATPases are present in the genomes of diverse unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that they have an ancient origin, and that they are important for cellular fitness. Inactivation of ATP13A2, one of the four human P5B ATPases, leads to early-onset Parkinson’s disease (Kufor-Rakeb Syndrome). The presence of an invariant PPALP motif within the putative substrate interaction pocket of transmembrane segment M4 suggests that all P5B ATPases might have similar transport specificity; however, the identity of the transport substrate(s) remains unknown. Nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis possess three paralogous P5B ATPase genes, &lt;i&gt;catp-5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;catp-6&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-7&lt;/i&gt;, which probably originated from a single ancestral gene around the time of origin of the Caenorhabditid clade. By using CRISPR/Cas9, we have systematically investigated the expression patterns, subcellular localization and biological functions of each of the P5B ATPases of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We find that each gene has a unique expression pattern, and that some tissues express more than one P5B. In some tissues where their expression patterns overlap, different P5Bs are targeted to different subcellular compartments (e.g., early endosomes vs. plasma membrane), whereas in other tissues they localize to the same compartment (plasma membrane). We observed lysosomal co-localization between CATP-6::GFP and LMP-1::RFP in transgenic animals; however, this was an artifact of the tagged LMP-1 protein, since anti-LMP-1 antibody staining of native protein revealed that LMP-1 and CATP-6::GFP occupy different compartments. The nematode P5Bs are at least partially redundant, since we observed synthetic sterility in &lt;i&gt;catp-5(0); catp-6(0)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;catp-6(0) catp-7(0)&lt;/i&gt; double mutants. The double mutants exhibit defects in distal tip cell migration that resemble those of &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt; (alpha integrin ortholog) and &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; (Pax6 ortholog) mutants, suggesting that the nematode P5Bs are required for &lt;i&gt;ina-1&lt;/i&gt;and/or &lt;i&gt;vab-3&lt;/i&gt; function. This is potentially a conserved regulatory interaction, since mammalian ATP13A2, alpha integrin and Pax6 are all required for proper dopaminergic neuron function.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Jeffrey Zielich</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194451</canonicalUrl><engagement>32</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849eb:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>689af77f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeffrey Zielich, Elena Tzima, Eva Ayla Schröder, Faten Jemel, Barbara Conradt, Eric J.

Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), one of the most important clinical pathogens, conducts an increasing number of morbidity and mortality in the world. Rapid and accurate strain typing of bacteria would facilitate epidemiological investigation and infection control in near real time. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a rapid and cost-effective tool for presumptive strain typing. To develop robust method for strain typing based on MALDI-TOF spectrum, machine learning (ML) is a promising algorithm for the construction of predictive model. In this study, a strategy of building templates of specific types was used to facilitate generating predictive models of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) strain typing through various ML methods. The strain types of the isolates were determined through multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the predictive accuracy of the models were compared. ST5, ST59, and ST239 were the major MLST types, and ST45 was the minor type. For binary classification, the AUC values of various ML methods ranged from 0.76 to 0.99 for ST5, ST59, and ST239 types. In multiclass classification, the predictive accuracy of all generated models was more than 0.83. This study has demonstrated that ML methods can serve as a cost-effective and promising tool that provides preliminary strain typing information about major MRSA lineages on the basis of MALDI-TOF spectra.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Hsin-Yao Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194289</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d6a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>c17343d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hsin-Yao Wang, Tzong-Yi Lee, Yi-Ju Tseng, Tsui-Ping Liu, Kai-Yao Huang, Yung-Ta Chang, Chun-Hsien Chen, Jang-Jih Lu&lt;/p&gt;

Estimation of visibility bias is critical to accurately compute abundance of wild populations. The franciscana, &lt;i&gt;Pontoporia blainvillei&lt;/i&gt;, is considered the most threatened small cetacean in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys are considered the most effective method to estimate abundance of this species, but many existing estimates have been considered unreliable because they lack proper estimation of correction factors for visibility bias. In this study, helicopter surveys were conducted to determine surfacing-diving intervals of franciscanas and to estimate availability for aerial platforms. Fifteen hours were flown and 101 groups of 1 to 7 franciscanas were monitored, resulting in a sample of 248 surface-dive cycles. The mean surfacing interval and diving interval times were 16.10 seconds (SE = 9.74) and 39.77 seconds (SE = 29.06), respectively. Availability was estimated at 0.39 (SE = 0.01), a value 16–46% greater than estimates computed from diving parameters obtained from boats or from land. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to investigate the influence of biological and environmental predictors on the proportion of time franciscana groups are visually available to be seen from an aerial platform. These models revealed that group size was the main factor influencing the proportion at surface. The use of negatively biased estimates of availability results in overestimation of abundance, leads to overly optimistic assessments of extinction probabilities and to potentially ineffective management actions. This study demonstrates that estimates of availability must be computed from suitable platforms to ensure proper conservation decisions are implemented to protect threatened species such as the franciscana.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Federico Sucunza</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194213</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d62:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>feee6ace</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Federico Sucunza, Daniel Danilewicz, Marta Cremer, Artur Andriolo, Alexandre N.

The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and its version for groups (TSST-G) are the gold standard for inducing acute psychosocial stress in human experimental settings and have been used in numerous studies since the early 1990s. The TSST and the TSST-G lead to effects on different physiological and psychological markers, such as salivary cortisol, anxiety, and emotional states. These effects were assessed with quantitative methods comparing pre-test and post-test measures with statistical analyses. But to date, no qualitative analyses have been conducted to examine the meaningful experience of participants during the TSST and the TSST-G. This study is the first to conduct qualitative investigations to further clarify the stressful experience of participants confronted with these procedures. Preliminary results showed as expected that the TSST and the TSST-G effectively induced psychosocial stress, with cortisol levels, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and arousal increases, and with pleasure and dominance decreases. At the qualitative level, the results evidenced that the two theoretically stressful components of the TSST and the TSST-G, namely social-evaluative threat and uncontrollability, were experienced as stress-inducing by the participants. Two case studies confirmed these findings. But the results also showed on one hand that psychosocial stress is a dynamic phenomenon, with important fluctuations throughout the tasks (mainly for the TSST-G); and on the other hand that despite the similar physiological and psychological responses between the TSST and the TSST-G evidenced by the literature, the experience of the participants was both similar and specific. Use of a qualitative method allowed us to provide a complementary point of view to understand the meaningful experience of participants during these stressful procedures, apprehending the dynamic of the subjective stress experience without disrupting it.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Olivier Vors</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195722</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3d0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>88cbcef6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Olivier Vors, Tanguy Marqueste, Nicolas Mascret&lt;/p&gt;

Such models typically have a constrained structure and make specific assumptions about the underlying human learning processes; these may make them underfit observed behaviours. Here we suggest an alternative method based on learning-to-learn approaches, using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision-making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task, and in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects&apos; choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach with a new dataset containing behaviour of uni-polar depression (n=34), bipolar (n=33) and control (n=34) participants in a two-armed bandit task.

Such models typically have a constrained structure and make specific assumptions about the underlying human learning processes; these may make them underfit observed behaviours. Here we suggest an alternative method based on learning-to-learn approaches, using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a flexible family of models that have sufficient capacity to represent the complex learning and decision-making strategies used by humans. In this approach, an RNN is trained to predict the next action that a subject will take in a decision-making task, and in this way, learns to imitate the processes underlying subjects&apos; choices and their learning abilities. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach with a new dataset containing behaviour of uni-polar depression (n=34), bipolar (n=33) and control (n=34) participants in a two-armed bandit task. The results indicate that the new approach is better than baseline reinforcement-learning methods in terms of overall performance and its capacity to predict subjects&apos; choices. We show that the model can be interpreted using off-policy simulations, and thereby provide a novel clustering of subjects&apos; learning processes -- something that often eludes traditional approaches to modelling and behavioural analysis.</description><published>1521529200000</published><title>Models that learn how humans learn: the case of depression and bipolar disorders [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01173</originId><author><name>Jaehyeok Jin, Gregory A.

Background &lt;p&gt;The clinical features of postoperative delirium are similar to the core features of alpha synuclein-related cognitive disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Therefore, we hypothesized that the non-motor symptoms (NMSs) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which precede the cardinal motor features of PD, are likely to be risk factors for developing postoperative delirium. We investigated the association between PD-related NMSs and postoperative delirium in old people undergoing elective spinal surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective study. Participants were aged 65 years and older and scheduled to undergo elective spinal surgery. During the enrollment period, 338 individuals were screened, 104 participants were included in the analysis. We assessed eight easily-assessed and representative PD-related NMSs 1 day before the scheduled surgery using tests or questionnaires for each symptom. The presence of delirium was determined by using the short version of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Fifteen (14.4%) of the 104 participants (age, 71.7 ± 4.7 years; men, 34.6%) met the CAM criteria for post-operative delirium. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that decreased olfactory function (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.44–0.91) and exhibiting rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD, OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09–1.93) were significantly independent predictors of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our study shows that hyposmia and RBD are significantly independent risk factors for postoperative delirium in general elderly population. Considering that NMSs may represent burden of alpha synuclein deposit, we postulate that an underlying alpha synucleinopathy may correlates with postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt; Significance &lt;p&gt;This study gives a novel insight for the risk factor of postoperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Ki Hoon Kim</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195749</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:17152a3:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>217a9dd7</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki Hoon Kim, Suk Yun Kang, Dong Ah Shin, Seong Yi, Yoon Ha, Keung Nyun Kim, Young Ho Sohn, Phil Hyu Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Yu Cong</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194868</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bb:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>c28e1e8e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yu Cong, Brit J.

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA.

However, existing approaches require a large number of plasma samples from healthy individuals, sequenced using the same platform and protocols to act as a reference panel. Obtaining this reference panel can be challenging, prohibitively expensive and limits the ability to migrate to improved sequencing platforms and improved protocols. Methods: We developed qCNV and sCNA-seq, two distinct tools that together provide a new approach for profiling somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) through the analysis of cell free DNA (cfDNA) without a reference panel. Our approach was designed to identify sCNA from cfDNA through the analysis of a single plasma sample and a matched normal DNA sample - both of which can be obtained from the same blood draw. qCNV is an efficient method for extracting read-depth from BAM files and sCNA-seq is a method that uses a probabilistic model of read depth to infer the copy number segmentation of the tumour. We compared the results from our pipeline to the established copy number profile of a cell-line, as well as the results from the plasma-Seq analysis of cfDNA-like mixtures and real, clinical data-sets. Results: With a single, unmatched, germline reference sample, our pipeline recapitulated the known copy number profile of a cell-line and demonstrated similar results to those obtained from plasma-Seq. With less than 1X genome coverage, our approach identified clinically relevant sCNA in samples with as little as 20 % tumour DNA. When applied to plasma samples from cancer patients, our pipeline identified clinically significant mutations. Conclusions: These results show it is possible to identify therapeutically-relevant copy number mutations from plasma samples without the need to generate a reference panel from a large number of healthy individuals. Together with the range of sequencing platforms supported by our qCNV+sCNA-Seq pipeline, as well as the Galaxy implementation of this solution, this pipeline makes cfDNA profiling more accessible and makes it easier to identify sCNA from the plasma of cancer patients.</description><published>1522220400000</published><title>Profiling copy number alterations in cell-free tumour DNA using a single-reference [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-b?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-b?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1225-b?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521135592000</published><author><name>Peterson, G.

Plastic pollution has been well documented in natural environments, including the open waters and sediments within lakes and rivers, the open ocean and even the air, but less attention has been paid to synthetic polymers in human consumables. Since multiple toxicity studies indicate risks to human health when plastic particles are ingested, more needs to be known about the presence and abundance of anthropogenic particles in human foods and beverages. This study investigates the presence of anthropogenic particles in 159 samples of globally sourced tap water, 12 brands of Laurentian Great Lakes beer, and 12 brands of commercial sea salt. Of the tap water samples analyzed, 81% were found to contain anthropogenic particles. The majority of these particles were fibers (98.3%) between 0.1–5 mm in length. The range was 0 to 61 particles/L, with an overall mean of 5.45 particles/L. Anthropogenic debris was found in each brand of beer and salt. Of the extracted particles, over 99% were fibers. After adjusting for particles found in lab blanks for both salt and beer, the average number of particles found in beer was 4.05 particles/L with a range of 0 to 14.3 particles/L and the average number of particles found in each brand of salt was 212 particles/kg with a range of 46.7 to 806 particles/kg. Based on consumer guidelines, our results indicate the average person ingests over 5,800 particles of synthetic debris from these three sources annually, with the largest contribution coming from tap water (88%).</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Mary Kosuth</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194970</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd81:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>c135152e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mary Kosuth, Sherri A.

GNI (range 0–1) was calculated from 1990–2015 for 186 countries, in seven World Bank income and WHO region groupings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;World GNI increased from 0.433 to 0.473 as decreased deficits overcompensated for the rise in obesity. GNI for African low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) (median 0.301 to 0.392) and South-East Asian LMIC (0.456 to 0.564) improved significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), while for high-income countries (0.657 to 0.611) worsened significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001). GNI for American LMIC (0.459 to 0.457), European LMIC (0.571 to 0.575), Eastern Mediterranean LMIC (0.484 to 0.483) and Western Pacific LMIC (0.433 to 0.494) were unchanged. The disaggregation of the GNI showed that in nearly all the seven country groups there was a significant decrease in both PEM and MID (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) (except in HIC where only PEM dropped), and a significant increase in obesity (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These trends are the result of the reciprocal changes between decreased under-nutrition and increased over-nutrition, which has become a major cause of malnutrition worldwide.

GNI for American LMIC (0.459 to 0.457), European LMIC (0.571 to 0.575), Eastern Mediterranean LMIC (0.484 to 0.483) and Western Pacific LMIC (0.433 to 0.494) were unchanged. The disaggregation of the GNI showed that in nearly all the seven country groups there was a significant decrease in both PEM and MID (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) (except in HIC where only PEM dropped), and a significant increase in obesity (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;These trends are the result of the reciprocal changes between decreased under-nutrition and increased over-nutrition, which has become a major cause of malnutrition worldwide. We suggest, therefore, that future Sustainable Development Goals should include alongside “zero hunger”–“reduce obesity”.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Global nutrition 1990–2015: A shrinking hungry, and expanding fat world</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2538.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2538.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2538.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Abasic sites are among the most abundant DNA lesions and interfere with DNA replication and transcription, but the mechanism of their action on transcription remains unknown.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001663</href></item></canonical><engagement>220</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2001663</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162208665b0:15c9c41:76251cdd</id><crawled>1520964101552</crawled><fingerprint>e9fb2329</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicholas R.

Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight and the largest animals to ever take wing. The pterosaurs persisted for over 150 million years before disappearing at the end of the Cretaceous, but the patterns of and processes driving their extinction remain unclear. Only a single family, Azhdarchidae, is definitively known from the late Maastrichtian, suggesting a gradual decline in diversity in the Late Cretaceous, with the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction eliminating a few late-surviving species. However, this apparent pattern may simply reflect poor sampling of fossils. Here, we describe a diverse pterosaur assemblage from the late Maastrichtian of Morocco that includes not only Azhdarchidae but the youngest known Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. With 3 families and at least 7 species present, the assemblage represents the most diverse known Late Cretaceous pterosaur assemblage and dramatically increases the diversity of Maastrichtian pterosaurs. At least 3 families—Pteranodontidae, Nyctosauridae, and Azhdarchidae—persisted into the late Maastrichtian. Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs show increased niche occupation relative to earlier, Santonian-Campanian faunas and successfully outcompeted birds at large sizes. These patterns suggest an abrupt mass extinction of pterosaurs at the K-Pg boundary.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ElO4GsSgvdo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1520967605395</recrawled><published>1520974800000</published><title>Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2859.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2859.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/2859.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>A central goal of crop improvement is to breed varieties with broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) to pathogens, but most of the major resistance (R) genes identified to date confer race-specific resistance to their adapted pathogens.

Background &lt;p&gt;Multiple drug resistant (MDR) intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are associated with notable direct and societal costs. As previous studies have not considered the impact of MDR on the total medical costs (TMCs) of IAIs, the present one examines this, as well as further estimates the additional costs at a national level.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective study. Firstly, we randomly selected a sample of 40% of all inpatients discharged between 2014 and 2015 from a teaching hospital, due to limits in budget and the large number of patients. Then, we manually selected 254 patients with IAIs according to the International Classification of Disease, 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; revision, using electronic medical records. Eventually, 101 patients with IAIs (64 MDR patients and 37 non-MDR patients) were included after excluding cases without laboratory test results, any pathogens detected, or antimicrobial resistant pathogens. Univariate analysis and a generalized linear model were applied to assess the parameters associated with TMCs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-MDR patients, those with MDR pathogens were significantly associated with higher TMCs, higher antimicrobial costs, higher antimicrobial usage, larger number of pathogens, and longer length of stay and were more likely to have insurance and combination antimicrobial therapy. In addition, the average TMC among patients with MDR pathogens was ¥ 131801, which is ¥ 90201 higher than those without MDR pathogens. If our results are applied to the whole country, the sum of all attributable TMCs was ¥ 37 billion. The societal costs, furthermore, were ¥111 billion in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our results provide information that should lead to increased efforts to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, in order to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens and to reduce their economic burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Xuemei Zhen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193977</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626db6a4a3:6ad280b:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522259109027</crawled><fingerprint>35d306d4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuemei Zhen, Yuanyuan Li, Yixi Chen, Peng Dong, Stephanie Liu, Hengjin Dong&lt;/p&gt;

Powdery mildew is a widespread fungal plant disease that can cause significant losses in many crops. Some &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes (&lt;i&gt;Mildew resistance locus O&lt;/i&gt;) have proved to confer a durable resistance to powdery mildew in several species. Resistance granted by the &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; gene family members has prompted an increasing interest in characterizing these genes and implementing their use in plant breeding. Lentil (&lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt; Medik.) is a widely grown food legume almost exclusively consumed as dry seed with an average world production of 4.5 million tons. Powdery mildew causes severe losses on certain lentil cultivars under particular environmental conditions. Data mining of the lentil CDC Redberry draft genome allowed to identify up to 15 gene sequences with homology to known &lt;i&gt;MLO&lt;/i&gt; genes, designated as &lt;i&gt;LcMLOs&lt;/i&gt;. Further characterization of these gene sequences and their deduced protein sequences demonstrated conformity with key MLO protein characteristics such as the presence of transmembrane and calmodulin binding domains, as well as that of other conserved motifs. Phylogenetic and other comparative analyses revealed that &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt; are the most likely gene orthologs related to powdery mildew response in other species, sharing a high similarity with other known resistance genes of dicot species, such as pea &lt;i&gt;PsMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula MtMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MtMLO3&lt;/i&gt;. Sets of primers were designed as tools to PCR amplify the genomic sequences of &lt;i&gt;LcMLO1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LcMLO3&lt;/i&gt;, also to screen lentil germplasm in search of resistance mutants. Primers were used to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes in all of the six wild lentil relatives. Respective to each gene, all &lt;i&gt;Lens&lt;/i&gt; sequences shared a high similarity. Likewise, we used these primers to screen a working collection of 58 cultivated and 23 wild lentil accessions in search of length polymorphisms present in these two genes. All these data widen the insights on this gene family and can be useful for breeding programs in lentil and close related species.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Carlos Polanco</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194945</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51d9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>6b48543f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Polanco, Luis E.

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Our work thus provides insight into how the immune system and microbes can coordinately promote enteric viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523554636000</published><title>Tropism for tuft cells determines immune promotion of norovirus pathogenesis</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195116</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195116</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195116</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by William R.

Over expression of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces apoptosis and reduces neointima formation occurring after saphenous vein interposition grafting or coronary stenting. In studies to address the mechanism of TIMP-3-driven apoptosis in human VSMCs we find that TIMP-3 increased activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis was inhibited by expression of Cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) and dominant negative FAS-Associated protein with Death Domain (FADD). TIMP-3 induced apoptosis did not cause mitochondrial depolarisation, increase activation of caspase-9 and was not inhibited by over-expression of B-cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), indicating a mitochondrial independent/type-I death receptor pathway. TIMP-3 increased levels of the First Apoptosis Signal receptor (FAS) and depletion of FAS with shRNA showed TIMP-3-induced apoptosis was FAS dependent. TIMP-3 induced formation of the Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC), as detected by immunoprecipitation and by immunofluorescence. Cellular-FADD-like IL-1 converting enzyme-Like Inhibitory Protein (c-FLIP) localised with FAS at the cell periphery in the absence of TIMP-3 and this localisation was lost on TIMP-3 expression with c-FLIP adopting a perinuclear localisation. Although TIMP-3 inhibited FAS shedding, this did not increase total surface levels of FAS but instead increased FAS levels within localised regions at the cell surface. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is inhibited by TIMP-3 and depletion of ADAM17 with shRNA significantly decreased FAS shedding. However ADAM17 depletion did not induce apoptosis or replicate the effects of TIMP-3 by increasing localised clustering of cell surface FAS. ADAM17-depleted cells could activate caspase-3 when expressing levels of TIMP-3 that were otherwise sub-apoptotic, suggesting a partial role for ADAM17 mediated ectodomain shedding in TIMP-3 mediated apoptosis. We conclude that TIMP-3 induced apoptosis in VSMCs is highly dependent on FAS and is associated with changes in FAS and c-FLIP localisation, but is not solely dependent on shedding of the FAS ectodomain.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>William R.

Despite increasing ability to store and analyze large amounts of data for organismal and ecological studies, the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images has largely remained time consuming and error-prone, particularly for tasks for which automation is difficult or impossible. Improving the efficiency of these tasks, which allows for more high quality data to be collected in a shorter amount of time, is therefore a high priority. The open-source web application, webpic, implements common web languages and widely available libraries and productivity apps to streamline the process of collecting distance and count measurements from images. In this paper, I introduce the framework of webpic and demonstrate one readily available feature of this application, linear measurements, using fossil leaf specimens. This application fills the gap between workflows accomplishable by individuals through existing software and those accomplishable by large, unmoderated crowds. It demonstrates that flexible web languages can be used to streamline time-intensive research tasks without the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software and highlights the potential for web resources to facilitate data collection in research tasks and outreach activities with improved efficiency.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Lucy M.

Despite the important role of apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion from astrocytes in brain lipid metabolism and the strong association of apoE4, one of the human apoE isoforms, with sporadic and late onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) little is known about the regulation of astrocytic apoE. Utilizing annotated chemical libraries and a phenotypic screening strategy that measured apoE secretion from a human astrocytoma cell line, inhibition of pan class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) was identified as a mechanism to increase apoE secretion. Knocking down select HDAC family members alone or in combination revealed that inhibition of the class I HDAC family was responsible for enhancing apoE secretion. Knocking down LXRα and LXRβ genes revealed that the increase in astrocytic apoE in response to HDAC inhibition occurred via an LXR-independent pathway.

Type IIB topoisomerases and their homologs support both archaeal/plant viability and meiotic recombination. Topo VI, a prototypical type IIB topoisomerase, comprises two Top6A and two Top6B protomers; how these subunits cooperate to engage two DNA segments and link ATP turnover to DNA transport is poorly understood. Using multiple biochemical approaches, we show that Top6B, which harbors the ATPase activity of topo VI, recognizes and exploits the DNA crossings present in supercoiled DNA to stimulate subunit dimerization by ATP. Top6B self-association in turn induces extensive DNA bending, which is needed to support duplex cleavage by Top6A.

Mirror exposure (ME) is one of the main components of the treatment of patients with eating disorders symptomatology and it has shown its effectiveness in improving several outcomes (e.g., body dissatisfaction). However, the study as to what body posture should be adopted to maximize its effectiveness has been neglected. From embodied cognition and emotion theories, the adoption of an expansive (vs. contractive) body posture has been associated with positive changes in cognitive and emotional responses. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of adopting an expansive (vs. contractive) posture before an ME task on body-related emotions and cognitions, as well as to analyze the possible moderator and mediator variables of these relationships. The sample was composed of 68 women (age: &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 21.74, &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 3.12) with high scores on body dissatisfaction. Participants were randomly assigned to the expansive or contractive condition, where the openness of the arms/legs and the back position were manipulated. Posture was monitored by an electronic device and participants filled out several self-reported measures. ANCOVAs, moderation, mediation, and moderated mediated analyses were performed. Results showed that women in the expansive condition showed higher positive emotions after the ME. Moreover, exploratory analyses showed that adopting an expansive posture improved positive emotions, leading to improvements in negative emotions, body image satisfaction, and appraisal of the person’s own body. Psychological interventions should explore the value of holding an expansive posture before the ME in women with body dissatisfaction.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Marta Miragall</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194686</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16253f14692:48a51cf:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521826743954</crawled><fingerprint>9fac8bb9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marta Miragall, Ernestina Etchemendy, Ausiàs Cebolla, Víctor Rodríguez, Carlos Medrano, Rosa María Baños&lt;/p&gt;

The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) is becoming the method of choice for expression of many eukaryotic proteins and protein complexes for biochemical, structural and pharmaceutical studies. Significant technological advancement has made generation of recombinant baculoviruses easy, efficient and user-friendly. However, there is a tremendous variability in the amount of proteins made using the BEVS, including different batches of virus made to express the same proteins. Yet, what influences the overall production of proteins or protein complexes remains largely unclear. Many downstream applications, particularly protein structure determination, require purification of large quantities of proteins in a repetitive manner, calling for a reliable experimental set-up to obtain proteins or protein complexes of interest consistently. During our investigation of optimizing the expression of the Mediator Head module, we discovered that the ‘initial infectivity’ was an excellent indicator of overall production of protein complexes. Further, we show that this initial infectivity can be mathematically described as a function of multiplicity of infection (MOI), correlating recombinant protein yield and virus titer. All these findings led us to develop the Titer Estimation for Quality Control (TEQC) method, which enables researchers to estimate initial infectivity, titer/MOI values in a simple and affordable way, and to use these values to quantitatively optimize protein expressions utilizing BEVS in a highly reproducible fashion.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Tsuyoshi Imasaki</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195356</canonicalUrl><engagement>31</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f6c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>e3336989</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuyoshi Imasaki, Sabine Wenzel, Kentaro Yamada, Megan L.

We validate our method through comprehensive simulations and analyze summary statistics from height and BMI GWAS to show that it produces estimates consistent with the known genetic makeup of both traits.</description><published>1522825200000</published><title>A unifying framework for joint trait analysis under a non-infinitesimal model [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1204?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1204?rss=1</link><crawled>1521143966531</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521135592000</published><author><name>Kupferschmidt, K.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6381/1204.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>123</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1622b3eeb43:d25149:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6381/1204?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>dca84617</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>European News, Scientific Community</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Max Planck Society, at a crossroads, seeks new leaders</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03480-w</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03480-w</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/eaL8C_ks2Gw/s41467-018-03480-w</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The preprophase band-associated kinesin-14 OsKCH2 is a processive minus-end-directed microtubule motor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preprophase band-associated kinesin-14 OsKCH2 is a processive minus-end-directed microtubule motor, Published online: 14 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03480-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03480-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Land plants lack the cytoplasmic dynein motor in fungi and animals that shows processive minus-end-directed motility on microtubules.

Drones are being increasingly used in innovative ways to enhance environmental research and conservation. Despite their widespread use for wildlife studies, there are few scientifically justified guidelines that provide minimum distances at which wildlife can be approached to minimize visual and auditory disturbance. These distances are essential to ensure that behavioral and survey data have no observer bias and form the basis of requirements for animal ethics and scientific permit approvals. In the present study, we documented the behaviors of three species of sea turtle (green turtles, &lt;i&gt;Chelonia mydas&lt;/i&gt;, flatback turtles, &lt;i&gt;Natator depressus&lt;/i&gt;, hawksbill turtles, &lt;i&gt;Eretmochelys imbricata&lt;/i&gt;), saltwater crocodiles (&lt;i&gt;Crocodylus porosus)&lt;/i&gt;, and crested terns (&lt;i&gt;Thalasseus bergii&lt;/i&gt;) in response to a small commercially available (1.4 kg) multirotor drone flown in Northern Territory and Western Australia. Sea turtles in nearshore waters off nesting beaches or in foraging habitats exhibited no evasive behaviors (e.g. rapid diving) in response to the drone at or above 20–30 m altitude, and at or above 10 m altitude for juvenile green and hawksbill turtles foraging on shallow, algae-covered reefs. Adult female flatback sea turtles were not deterred by drones flying forward or stationary at 10 m altitude when crawling up the beach to nest or digging a body pit or egg chamber. In contrast, flyovers elicited a range of behaviors from crocodiles, including minor, lateral head movements, fleeing, or complete submergence when a drone was present below 50 m altitude. Similarly, a colony of crested terns resting on a sand-bank displayed disturbance behaviors (e.g. flight response) when a drone was flown below 60 m altitude. The current study demonstrates a variety of behavioral disturbance thresholds for diverse species and should be considered when establishing operating conditions for drones in behavioral and conservation studies.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Elizabeth Bevan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194460</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087ea:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>fe047054</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elizabeth Bevan, Scott Whiting, Tony Tucker, Michael Guinea, Andrew Raith, Ryan Douglas&lt;/p&gt;

Genetically-controlled plant resistance can reduce the damage caused by pathogens. However, pathogens have the ability to evolve and overcome such resistance. This often occurs quickly after resistance is deployed, resulting in significant crop losses and a continuing need to develop new resistant cultivars. To tackle this issue, several strategies have been proposed to constrain the evolution of pathogen populations and thus increase genetic resistance durability. These strategies mainly rely on varying different combinations of resistance sources across time (crop rotations) and space. The spatial scale of deployment can vary from multiple resistance sources occurring in a single cultivar (pyramiding), in different cultivars within the same field (cultivar mixtures) or in different fields (mosaics). However, experimental comparison of the efficiency (i.e. ability to reduce disease impact) and durability (i.e. ability to limit pathogen evolution and delay resistance breakdown) of landscape-scale deployment strategies presents major logistical challenges. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit stochastic model able to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes of the four major deployment options described above, including both qualitative resistance (i.e. major genes) and quantitative resistance traits against several components of pathogen aggressiveness: infection rate, latent period duration, propagule production rate, and infectious period duration. This model, implemented in the R package &lt;i&gt;landsepi&lt;/i&gt;, provides a new and useful tool to assess the performance of a wide range of deployment options, and helps investigate the effect of landscape, epidemiological and evolutionary parameters. This article describes the model and its parameterisation for rust diseases of cereal crops, caused by fungi of the genus &lt;i&gt;Puccinia&lt;/i&gt;. To illustrate the model, we use it to assess the epidemiological and evolutionary potential of the combination of a major gene and different traits of quantitative resistance. The comparison of the four major deployment strategies described above will be the objective of future studies.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7LHbywjCaMk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006067</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_162baf3e3ad:bf9d20:76251cdd</id><crawled>1523554968493</crawled><fingerprint>356a8b1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Loup Rimbaud, Julien Papaïx, Jean-François Rey, Luke G.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects besides muscle also the brain, resulting in memory and behavioral problems. The consequences of dystrophinopathy on gross macroscopic alterations are unclear. To elucidate the effect of full-length dystrophin expression on brain morphology, we used high-resolution post-mortem MRI in mouse models that either express 0% (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;), 100% (BL10) or a low amount of full-length dystrophin (&lt;i&gt;mdx&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Xist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Δhs&lt;/sup&gt;). While absence or low amounts of full-length dystrophin did not significantly affect whole brain volume and skull morphology, we found differences in volume of individual brain structures.

The burden of depression and anxiety disorders is greater in women, and female sex hormones have been shown to affect mood. Psychological side effects of hormonal contraception (HC) are also a common complaint in the clinic, but few previous studies have investigated this subject. We therefore wanted to investigate whether use of HC was associated with adverse psychological health outcomes, and whether this association was modified by age. All women aged 12–30 years on 31 December 2010, residing in Sweden for at least four years and with no previous psychiatric morbidity (n = 815 662), were included. We followed the women from their first HC use (or 31 December 2010, if they were non-users) at baseline, until a prescription fill of psychotropic drugs or the end of the one-year follow-up. We performed age-stratified logistic regression models and estimated odds ratios (OR) to measure the association between different HC methods and psychotropic drug use, as well as the area under the receiver operating curve to estimate discriminatory accuracy of HC in relation to psychotropic drugs. Overall, we found an association between HC and psychotropic drugs (adjusted OR 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.37). In the age-stratified analysis, the strongest association was found in adolescent girls (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 3.04–4.94 for age 12 to 14 years), while it was non-existent for adult women. We conclude that hormonal contraception is associated with psychotropic drug use among adolescent girls, suggesting an adverse effect of HC on psychological health in this population.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Sofia Zettermark</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194773</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>6b2f05c2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sofia Zettermark, Raquel Perez Vicente, Juan Merlo&lt;/p&gt;

Two plasma devices at atmospheric pressure (air dielectric barrier discharge and helium plasma jet) have been used to study the early germination of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; seeds during the first days. Then, plasma activated waters are used during the later stage of plant development and growth until 42 days. The effects on both testa and endospserm ruptures during the germination stage are significant in the case of air plasma due to its higher energy and efficiency of producing reactive oxygen species than the case of helium plasma. The latter has shown distinct effects only for testa rupture. Analysis of germination stimulations are based on specific stainings for reactive oxygen species production, peroxidase activity and also membrane permeability tests. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has shown a smoother seed surface for air plasma treated seeds that can explain the plasma induced-germination. During the growth stage, plants were watered using 4 kinds of water (tap and deionized waters activated or not by the low temperature plasma jet). With regards to other water kinds, the characterization of the tap water has shown a larger conductivity, acidity and concentration of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Only the tap water activated by the plasma jet has shown a significant effect on the plant growth. This effect could be correlated to reactive nitrogen species such as nitrite/nitrate species present in plasma activated tap water.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Maxime Bafoil</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195512</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:1715291:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>fa5a3ed9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maxime Bafoil, Achraf Jemmat, Yves Martinez, Nofel Merbahi, Olivier Eichwald, Christophe Dunand, Mohammed Yousfi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;PPAR-gamma (γ) is highly expressed in macrophages and its activation affects their polarization. The effect of PPAR-γ activation on Kupffer cells (KCs) and liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) has not yet been evaluated. We investigated the effect of PPAR-γ activation on KC-polarization and IRI.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;Seventy percent (70%) liver ischemia was induced for 60mins. PPAR-γ-agonist or vehicle was administrated before reperfusion. PPAR-γ-antagonist was used to block PPAR-γ activation. Liver injury, necrosis, and apoptosis were assessed post-reperfusion. Flow-cytometry determined KC-phenotypes (pro-inflammatory Nitric Oxide +, anti-inflammatory CD206+ and anti-inflammatory IL-10+).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liver injury assessed by serum AST was significantly decreased in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group at all time points post reperfusion (1hr: 3092±105 vs 4469±551; p = 0.042; 6hr: 7041±1160 vs 12193±1143; p = 0.015; 12hr: 5746±328 vs 8608±1259; p = 0.049). Furthermore, liver apoptosis measured by TUNEL-staining was significantly reduced in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group post reperfusion (1hr:2.46±0.49 vs 6.90±0.85%;p = 0.001; 6hr:26.40±2.93 vs 50.13±8.29%; p = 0.048). H&amp;amp;E staining demonstrated less necrosis in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (24hr:26.66±4.78 vs 45.62±4.57%; p = 0.032). The percentage of pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs was significantly lower at all post reperfusion time points in the PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group (1hr:28.49±4.99 vs 53.54±9.15%; p = 0.040; 6hr:5.51±0.54 vs 31.12±9.58%; p = 0.009; 24hr:4.15±1.50 vs 17.10±4.77%; p = 0.043). In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells. PPAR-γ activation can become an important tool to improve outcomes in liver surgery through decreasing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of KCs and IRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Ivan Linares</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195212</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f4:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>3b96ee5f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ivan Linares, Kaveh Farrokhi, Juan Echeverri, Johan Moritz Kaths, Dagmar Kollmann, Matyas Hamar, Peter Urbanellis, Sujani Ganesh, Oyedele A.

In contrast, percentage of anti-inflammatory CD206+ KCs was significantly higher in PPAR-γ-agonist versus control group prior to IRI (8.62±0.96 vs 4.88 ±0.50%; p = 0.04). Administration of PPAR-γ-antagonist reversed the beneficial effects on AST, apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory NO+ KCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;PPAR-γ activation reduces IRI and decreases the pro-inflammatory NO+ Kupffer cells.

Hyperopia is a common refractive error, apparent in 25% of Europeans. Treatments include spectacles, contact lenses, laser interventions and surgery including implantable contact lenses and lens extraction. Laser treatment offers an expedient and reliable means of correcting ametropia. LASIK is well-established however SMILE (small-incision lenticule extraction) or lenticule implantation (derived from myopic laser-correction) are newer options. In this study we compared the outcomes of hyperopic LASIK, SMILE and lenticule re-implantation in a primate model at +2D/+4D treatment. While re-implantation showed the greatest regression, broadly comparable refractive results were seen at 3-months with SMILE and LASIK (&amp;lt;1.4D of intended), but a greater tendency to regression in +2D lenticule reimplantation. Central corneal thickness showed greater variation at +2D treatment, but central thickening during lenticule reimplantation at +4D treatment was seen (-17± 27μm LASIK, -45 ± 18μm SMILE and 28 ± 17μm Re-implantation; p &amp;lt;0.01) with expected paracentral thinning following SMILE. Although in vivo confocal microscopy appeared to show higher reflectivity in all +4D treatment groups, there were minimal and inconsistent changes in inflammatory responses between modalities. SMILE and lenticule re-implantation may represent a safe and viable method for treating hyperopia, but further optimization for lower hyperopic treatments is warranted.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Geraint P.

Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase (EIF2AK) proteins inhibit protein synthesis at translation initiation level, in response to various stress conditions, including oxidative stress, heme deficiency, osmotic shock, and heat shock. Origin and functional diversification of EIF2AK sequences remain ambiguous. Here we determine the origin and molecular evolution of EIF2AK proteins in lower eukaryotes and studied the molecular basis of divergence among sub-family sequences. Present work emphasized primitive origin of EIF2AK4 sub-family gene in lower eukaryotes of protozoan lineage. Phylogenetic analysis supported common origin and sub-family based classification of EIF2AKs. Functional divergence studies across sub-families revealed several putative amino acid sites, which assist in altered protein interactions of kinase domains. The data can facilitate designing site-directed experimental studies aiming at elucidating diverse functional aspects of kinase domains regarding down-regulation of protein synthesis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>K.

Background &lt;p&gt;Many mathematical models have investigated the population-level impact of expanding antiretroviral therapy (ART), using different assumptions about HIV disease progression on ART and among ART dropouts.

The model was independently calibrated to HIV prevalence and ART coverage data from the United States under each progression assumption in turn. New HIV infections and HIV-related deaths averted over 10 years were compared for fixed ART coverage increases.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Little absolute difference (&amp;lt;7 percentage points (pp)) in HIV infections averted over 10 years was seen between progression assumptions for the same increases in ART coverage (varied between 33% and 90%) if ART dropouts reinitiated ART at the same rate as ART-naïve MSM.

Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; species, which is one of the main animal feed contaminants causing reproductive disorders in livestock. The aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic characteristics and ZEN removal ability of a &lt;i&gt;Bacillus licheniformis&lt;/i&gt; strain CK1. The probiotic properties, including acidic tolerance, bile salt tolerance, adherence capability, and anti-pathogenic activities of CK1 were evaluated. CK1 survived after incubation at pH 2.0 or 3.0 for 3 h, grew well in LB broth containing 0.3% oxgall, possessed adherence capability to Caco-2 cells, and inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 and &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;. The ZEN removal ability of CK1 was compared with a mineral mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), and a well-characterized biological mycotoxin-adsorbing agent, &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&lt;/i&gt; GG (LGG). At 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing 5 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of ZEN, the ZEN removal percentage of CK1 was 73.0%, which was significantly higher than that of HSCAS and LGG (45.9% and 48.4%, respectively). In the pH range of 2.5–8.0, CK1 removed up to 65% of ZEN. At temperatures between 4 and 42°C, CK1 removed more than 75% of ZEN. In the adsorption stability analysis, the amounts of ZEN removed by CK1 was over 30% even after five consecutive rounds of washing procedures. These findings demonstrated that CK1 displayed probiotic characteristics and removed ZEN effectively. Therefore, CK1 has a great potential for the development of feed additive to remove ZEN.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Tsui-Chun Hsu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194866</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5cf9e5b:77dd7c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523468705371</crawled><fingerprint>fdd5bec1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tsui-Chun Hsu, Ping-Jung Yi, Ting-Yu Lee, Je-Ruei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, secretes several effector proteins that bind host DNA to modulate host gene expression. The tandem repeat protein 120 (TRP120), one of the largest effector proteins, has four nearly identical tandem repeat (TR) regions that each consists of 80 amino acids. In addition to playing a role in ehrlichial binding and internalization, TRP120 translocates to the host nucleus where it is thought to function as a transcription factor that modulates gene expression. However, sequence analysis of TRP120 does not identify the presence of DNA-binding or trans-activation domains typical of classical eukaryotic transcription factors. Thus, the mechanism by which TRP120 binds DNA and modulates gene expression remains elusive. Herein, we expressed the TR regions of the TRP120 protein, and characterized its solution structure and ability to bind DNA. TRP120, expressed as either a one or two TR repeat, is a monomer in solution, and is mostly disordered as determined by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Using NMR spectroscopy, we further show that the 1 TR construct selectively binds GC-rich DNA. Although low pH was required for TRP120 TR-DNA interaction, acidic pH alone does not induce any significant structural changes in the TR region. This suggests that TRP120 folds into an ordered structure upon forming a protein-DNA complex, and thus folding of TRP120 TR is coupled with DNA binding.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Valerie J.

This suggests that TRP120 folds into an ordered structure upon forming a protein-DNA complex, and thus folding of TRP120 TR is coupled with DNA binding.</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&amp;lt;/i&gt; TRP120 nucleomodulin binds DNA with disordered tandem repeat domain</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022264?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521694876000</published><author><name>Nikolai F.

Fire is a major driver in many ecosystems. Yet, little is known about how different ground-living arthropods survive fire. Using three sampling methods, and time-since-fire (last fire event: 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years), we investigate how ground-living arthropod diversity responds to fire, and how species richness, diversity, abundance, and composition of the four dominant taxa: ants, beetles, cockroaches and mites, respond. We did this in the naturally fire-prone Mediterranean-type scrubland vegetation (fynbos) of the Cape Floristic Region. Surprisingly, overall species richness and diversity was the same for all time-since-fire categories. However, when each dominant taxon was analysed separately, effect of fire on species richness and abundance varied among taxa. This emphasizes that many taxa must be investigated to really understand fire-driven events. We also highlight the importance of using different diversity measures, as fire did not influence species richness and abundance of particular taxa, while it affected others, overall greatly affecting assemblages of all taxa. Rockiness affected species richness, abundance and composition of a few taxa. We found that all time-since-fire categories supported distinctive assemblages. Some indicator species occurred across all time-since-fire categories, while others were restricted to a single time-since-fire category, showing that there is a wide range of responses to fire between taxa. Details of local landscape structure, abiotic and biotic, and frequency and intensity of fire add complexity to the fire-arthropod interaction. Overall, we show that the relationship between fire and arthropods is phylogenetically constrained, having been honed by many millennia of fire events, and highly complex. Present-day species manifest a variety of adaptations for surviving the great natural selective force of fire.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Inam Yekwayo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195414</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f71:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>b4de967f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inam Yekwayo, James S.

It’s from the IBM Zürich group that has pioneered so much work in this area. Over just the time I’ve been writing this blog, that idea has gone from “Maybe someday” to “In some well-defined &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/09/03/real_molecules&quot;&gt;test cases&lt;/a&gt;” to “A few real-world examples known”, and now perhaps to “Hey, this might actually start working”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not just AFM. There’s also scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), among other even more exotic ideas, and together you can get information that simply cannot be obtained by any other methods. Here they are in that order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AFM is done typically by picking up a single CO molecule (from the carbon end) with the tip of the metal probe and scanning with the oxygen end across an adsorbed molecule (at liquid helium temperatures) at a constant height, about 4 Angstroms over the molecule itself. Often you go back and scan at several different tip heights. There are many other possible tips – xenon atoms, other diatomic molecules, halogen atoms, and so on. The cantilever holding the tip is oscillating (over about half an Angstrom) at a high frequency, and changes in this, induced by interactions with the molecule under study, are what get measured out (along with deflections in the angle that the CO molecule makes with the surface).  The mechanism for these changes is just flat-out Pauli repulsion for the most part – electrons not wanting to occupy the same volume of space and getting out of each other’s way – although van der Waals and electrostatic forces can show up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPFM is pretty similar, except the readout is the voltage dependence of the position of the tip relative to the molecule, rather than changes in frequency of oscillation. You pick a voltage that gives you good signal/noise and scan around as with AFM. In practice, that gives you more of a pure electrostatic read on the surface, and it’s very useful for determining charge states and electron density in the sample. For example, fluorine is very close to the size of hydrogen, but they look dramatically different in KPFM because of the mass of electrons around the F atoms. Interpretation of the data, though, is not very straightforward, and often seems to involve matching up the experimental results to various calculations to try to see what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, in STM you apply a voltage to the tip and measure the changes in electric current between the tip and the sample as you scan, often by having the tip height change to keep a constant current level. At these distances, electrons are tunneling right across the gap, so this is sheer quantum mechanics all the way. If you pick the appropriate voltage, electrons can be temporarily attached to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the test molecule (or detached from the highest-occupied, the HOMO, if you flip the voltage around), and the resulting images are absolutely &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt; for someone like me who came up thinking of these as mathematical abstractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of these, with a CO tip used to show the bonds in the graphene-like molecule and then (in STM mode), its LUMO. As you can see, the resolution on these experiments is getting pretty good, and allows for an unequivocal assignment of the structure. Of course, an X-ray structure determination would almost certainly nail that down, too, but for that you have to have a purified sample and a good crystal. One interesting thing about AFM-type techniques is that you can scatter a mixed sample across the surface and take a look at the various things that might be in it, one molecule at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At right is an illustration of something else that can really only be done under AFM conditions: actual atomic-level manipulation of the sample. Individual atoms can be pushed, twanged, or (as in this case) removed entirely. The result can be highly reactive intermediates (radicals, arynes, etc.) that can be studied directly at the liquid-helium temperatures involved. There are also opportunities to do on-surface reaction by heating followed by cooling down to AFM conditions, through photochemistry, etc. You can also study the interaction of individual molecules with each other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, it has to be said that there are not very many labs that are capable of these things at the moment, but that’s changing with the advent of more commercial apparatus and the spread of experienced workers in the field. What’s lacking? As the authors note, there’s a real need for techniques that might be able to read out functional groups and elements more directly. An even bigger challenge is that all the most spectacular results to date have been on planar or near-planar molecules, since these yield the most (and the most interpretable) data. You’re running your quantum fingers over the surface of things here, so the inside of a folded-up conformation is just not going to be available. And finally, there need to be improvements in the time it takes to get a measurement. It’s been stuck at roughly ten-minutes-per-molecule for a long time, but better time resolution would allow for a lot of new things to be picked up (and for better characterization of mixtures, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Patients with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates sharing identical DNA fingerprint patterns can be epidemiologically linked. However, municipal health services in the Netherlands are able to confirm an epidemiological link in only around 23% of the patients with isolates clustered by the conventional variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) genotyping. This research aims to investigate whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a more reliable predictor of epidemiological links between tuberculosis patients than VNTR genotyping.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;VNTR genotyping and WGS were performed in parallel on all &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; complex isolates received at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in 2016. Isolates were clustered by VNTR when they shared identical 24-loci VNTR patterns; isolates were assigned to a WGS cluster when the pair-wise genetic distance was ≤ 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Cluster investigation was performed by municipal health services on all isolates clustered by VNTR in 2016. The proportion of epidemiological links identified among patients clustered by either method was calculated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In total, 535 isolates were genotyped, of which 25% (134/535) were clustered by VNTR and 14% (76/535) by WGS; the concordance between both typing methods was 86%. The proportion of epidemiological links among WGS clustered cases (57%) was twice as common than among VNTR clustered cases (31%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;When WGS was applied, the number of clustered isolates was halved, while all epidemiologically linked cases remained clustered. WGS is therefore a more reliable tool to predict epidemiological links between tuberculosis cases than VNTR genotyping and will allow more efficient transmission tracing, as epidemiological investigations based on false clustering can be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Rana Jajou</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195413</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57603:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>c5d67f74</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rana Jajou, Albert de Neeling, Rianne van Hunen, Gerard de Vries, Henrieke Schimmel, Arnout Mulder, Richard Anthony, Wim van der Hoek, Dick van Soolingen&lt;/p&gt;

Although several studies have demonstrated a potential correlation of dietary patterns with cognitive function, the relationship between tooth loss and dietary patterns and cognitive function have not been identified. In this cross-sectional study, we used a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, a technique used previously to observe dietary patterns based on the intakes of nutrients or levels of biomarkers associated with the condition of interest, to identify tooth loss-related dietary patterns and investigate the associations of such patterns with cognitive impairment in 334 community-dwelling Japanese subjects aged ≥ 60 years. According to Pearson correlation coefficients, the intakes of six nutrients (ash content, sodium, zinc, vitamin B1, α- and β-carotene) correlated significantly with the number of remaining teeth. Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. These results may motivate changes in dental treatment and the dietary behaviours and thereby lower the risk of cognitive impairment.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Mai Ishimiya</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194504</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a626:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>9a28d4ea</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Ishimiya, Hiroyuki Nakamura, Yutaka Kobayashi, Moeko Noguchi-Shinohara, Chiemi Abe, Chiaki Dohmoto, Yoshihisa Ikeda, Kahori Tokuno, Kazuhiro Ooi, Masami Yokokawa, Kazuo Iwasa, Kiyonobu Komai, Shuichi Kawashiri, Masahito Yamada&lt;/p&gt;

Using RRR analysis, we extracted four dietary patterns in our subject population that explained 86.67% of the total variation in the intakes of these six nutrients. Particularly, dietary pattern 1 (DP1) accounted for 52.2% of the total variation. Food groups with factor loadings of ≥ 0.2 included pickled green leafy vegetables, lettuce/cabbage, green leaves vegetables, cabbage, carrots/squash; by contrast, rice had a factor loading of &amp;lt;−0.2. In a multivariate regression analysis, the adjusted odds ratios regarding the prevalence of cognitive impairment for the lowest, middle and highest tertiles of the DP1 score were 1.00 (reference), 1.224 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.611–2.453) and 0.427 (95% CI: 0.191–0.954), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that tooth loss-related dietary patterns are associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. These results may motivate changes in dental treatment and the dietary behaviours and thereby lower the risk of cognitive impairment.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Tooth loss-related dietary patterns and cognitive impairment in an elderly Japanese population: The Nakajima study</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Hui-Wan Chuang, Chi-Wen Kao, Ming-Der Lee, Yue-Cune Chang&lt;/p&gt;
Depression is a common issue in institutionalized elderly people. The “Attentively Embracing Story” theory is applied to help individuals transform negative thoughts into positive, and reflect on spiritual healing. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a “Story-Centred Care Intervention Program” based on the “Attentively Embracing Story” theory in improving depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and heart rate variability in institutionalized elderly people. Seventy long-term care residents were recruited from two long-term care facilities and randomized into the story-centred care intervention (n = 35) and control groups (n = 35). We excluded five long-term care residents who did not complete the post-test measures and five long-term care residents who had interference events on the outcome measures. Finally, sixty long-term care residents (40 women and 20 men; age 84.3±5.98 years) were included in the final analysis. Data were collected at four times (pre-intervention and post-intervention, 1 and 3-month follow-up) and analyzed with the generalized estimating equation approach.Instruments, including Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Portable Mind Status Questionnaire, and a CheckMyHeart device to measure heart rate variability, were used in study. The degree of improvement in depressive symptoms was significantly higher in the story-centred care intervention group than in the control group after providing the story-centred care intervention program (p &amp;lt; .001) and at 1 and 3-month follow-up (p = .001, p = .006, respectively; GDS-15 score reduced 1.816 at the 3-month follow-up). Participants receiving the story-centred care intervention program showed significantly greater improvement than those in the control group in the cognitive function at 1and 3-month follow-up (p = .009, p = .024, respectively; SPMSQ score reduced 0.345 at the 3-month follow-up). The heart rate variability parameters (SDNN, RMSSD) did not show a statistically significant increase. However an increasing trend in the parameters was observed in the intervention group (SDNN increased 16.235ms at the 3-month follow-up; RMSSD increased 16.424 ms at the 3-month follow-up). In conclusions, the story-centred care intervention program was effective on the improvement of depressive symptoms and cognitive status in institutionalized elderly people.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Hui-Wan Chuang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194178</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>b7db9068</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hui-Wan Chuang, Chi-Wen Kao, Ming-Der Lee, Yue-Cune Chang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant pathogens in the world, causing root rot in more than a thousand plant species. This observational study was carried out on a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; infected heathland of &lt;i&gt;Erica umbellata&lt;/i&gt; used as goat pasture. The patterns and shapes of disease foci and their distribution were described in a spatial and temporal context using an aerial photograph record. A set of topographic traits was selected on the basis of a disease dynamic hypothesis and their effects on observed spatial disease patterns were analyzed. Incipient infections situated in flat terrain expanded as compact circular front patterns with a low growth rate. On slopes, disease patches developed more rapidly down slope, forming parabolic shapes. The axis direction of the parabolas was highly correlated with terrain aspect, while the parabolic amplitude was associated with land curvature and slope. New secondary foci appeared over the years producing an accelerated increase of the affected surface. These new foci were observed in sites where disease density was higher or near sites more frequently visited by animals such as the stable or the forage crop. In contrast, a smaller number of disease foci occur in areas which animals are reluctant to visit, such as where they have a short range of vision. Our results suggest that 1) the growth of existing &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt; foci is controlled by a combination of root-to-root contact and water flows, 2) the increase in the diseased area arises mainly from the multiplication of patches, 3) the formation of new foci is mediated by long-distance transport due to the movement of animals and humans along certain preferential pathways, and 4) geomorphology and topography traits are associated with the epidemiology of this soil-borne pathogen.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Enrique Cardillo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195060</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c50:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>7f82b0f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Enrique Cardillo, Angel Acedo, Enrique Abad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of epithelial cell-cell contacts relies on actin-based protrusions as well as tightly controlled turnover of junctional actin once cells encounter each other and adhesion complexes assemble. The specific contributions of individual actin regulators on either protrusion formation or junctional actin turnover remain largely unexplored. Based on our previous findings of Formin-like 2 (FMNL2)-mediated control of junctional actin dynamics, we investigated its potential role in membrane protrusions and impact on newly forming epithelial contacts. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss of FMNL2 in human MCF10A cells combined with optogenetic control of Rac1 activity confirmed its critical function in the establishment of intercellular contacts. While lamellipodial protrusion rates remained unaffected, FMNL2 knockout cells were characterized by impaired filopodia formation similar to depletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. Silencing of Cdc42, however, failed to affect FMNL2-mediated contact formation. Hence, we propose a cell-cell contact-specific and Rac1-mediated function of FMNL2 entirely independent of Cdc42. Consistent with this, direct visualizations of native epithelial junction formation revealed a striking and specifically Rac1- and not Cdc42-dependent recruitment of FMNL2 to newly forming junctions as well as established cell-cell contacts within epithelial sheets.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Hanna Grobe</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194716</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f3:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>f712f6c3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hanna Grobe, Andrea Wüstenhagen, Christian Baarlink, Robert Grosse, Katharina Grikscheit&lt;/p&gt;

Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents’ behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Carolina Feher da Silva</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195328</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f67:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>fd628d0a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carolina Feher da Silva, Todd A.

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published.

The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth–death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via ‘conditioning through experience’ may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_sQDfPObu6Y&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><recrawled>1523471765247</recrawled><published>1523480400000</published><title>Age is not just a number: Naive T cells increase their ability to persist in the circulation over time</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00106</originId><author><name>Meixi Hao, Siyuan Hou, Lingjing Xue, Haoliang Yuan, Lulu Zhu, Cong Wang, Bin Wang, Chunming Tang, Can Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/rtHQaCgQQ70/acs.jmedchem.8b00106</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>165</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00106/20180315/images/medium/jm-2018-001062_0011.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00106</href></item></canonical><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.8b00106/20180315/images/medium/jm-2018-001062_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00106&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Spawning ground of Japanese eel (&lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&lt;/i&gt;) is located near the West Mariana Ridge seamount. The species travels through the North Equatorial Current (NEC) and then enters the Kuroshio Current (KC) on the migration toward East Asian growth habitats. Therefore, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events serve as the potentially important drivers of interannual variability across the equatorial Pacific. Because the NEC bifurcation and salinity profiles are related to ENSO events, we investigated the influence of locations of the NEC bifurcation and salinity front on the success of larval entry to the KC by numerically modeling particle transport in ocean currents from 1972 to 2013 and possible effects on the size of glass eels at continental recruitment and, via otolithometry on the duration of larval migration. Circulation and hydrography used for particle tracking were obtained from the results of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) high-resolution forecasting experiment. Our results demonstrated that during El Niño years, (1) the southward movement of the salinity front might cause the larvae to experience slower currents and (2) the northward movement of the NEC bifurcation might broaden the separation between their spawning ground and NEC bifurcation, thus prolonging the time needed for the larvae to enter the KC from their spawning ground, because of which the duration of entrainment in the water column and body size increase when eels reach estuarine waters. In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Kuan-Mei Hsiung</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195544</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9b3:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>2467dea2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kuan-Mei Hsiung, Shingo Kimura, Yu-San Han, Aigo Takeshige, Yoshiyuki Iizuka&lt;/p&gt;

In addition, this might cause more water to flow into the Mindanao Current (MC), leading to a decline in the rate at which larvae get entrained into the KC.</description><published>1523394000000</published><title>Effect of ENSO events on larval and juvenile duration and transport of Japanese eel (&amp;lt;i&gt;Anguilla japonica&amp;lt;/i&gt;)</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23093-z</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23093-z</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/ZzD0FT3lXAY/s41598-018-23093-z</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &lt;i&gt;Distal-less&lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &amp;lt;i&gt;Distal-less&amp;lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23093-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23093-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &lt;i&gt;Distal-less&lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZzD0FT3lXAY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><width>634</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>685</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-23093-z/MediaObjects/41598_2018_23093_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Syeda Nayab Fatima Abidi</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23093-z</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_162481151d4:352f8c6:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521627517396</crawled><fingerprint>a88c2ea6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &lt;i&gt;Distal-less&lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &amp;lt;i&gt;Distal-less&amp;lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &amp;lt;i&gt;Drosophila&amp;lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23093-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23093-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cell fate changes induced by a &lt;i&gt;Distal-less&lt;/i&gt; enhancer-trap transgene in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; antennal imaginal disc&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/ZzD0FT3lXAY&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1521615600000</published><title>Cell fate changes induced by a Distal-less enhancer-trap transgene in the Drosophila antennal imaginal disc</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03970-x</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03970-x</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/_XsFI6xsSuA/s41467-018-03970-x</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cell-free prediction of protein expression costs for growing cells&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cell-free prediction of protein expression costs for growing cells, Published online: 13 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03970-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03970-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The translation of heterologous proteins places a burden on host cell resources, affecting growth and productivity.

Here we conducted a retrospective analysis of hospital-based trauma registry database for evaluating the impacts of comorbidities on the prognosis for traumatized patients using Index of Coexistent Comorbidity Disease (ICED) scores. We analyzed the data of patients with blunt trauma who visited emergency department between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2015 in Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung branch, a single level I trauma center in the Northern Taiwan. All consecutive patients with blunt trauma who admitted to the intensive care unit or ordinary ward after initial managements in the emergency department were included. We measured the hospital mortality of blunt traumatized patients using alive discharge as a competing risk. To investigate conditional independence of mortality and ICED scores given Injury Severity Score (ISS), we used log-linear models for modeling independence structures. Overall, we included 4997 patients (median age [IQR], 59 years old (44–75 years); 55.3% male). The mortality rate of blunt traumatized patients was higher in the higher ICED scores group compared to lower ICED scores group (4.7% vs 1.8%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, the higher ICED scores group were associated with older age, higher ISS, and longer hospital stay than lower ICED scores group. Higher ICED group had higher probability of transition-to-death and lower probability of transition-to-discharge under the competing risk model. In the multivariable analysis of transition-specific Cox models, higher ICED group were associated with higher risk for hospital mortality compared to lower ICED group (HR 1.60; [95% CI 1.04–2.47]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032). Also, higher ICED group were associated with lower probability of transition-to-discharge (HR 0.79; [95%CI 0.73–0.86]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, higher ICED scores accounted for hospital mortality among patients with ISS &amp;lt; 25. In conclusion, our study suggested that severity of comorbidity was associated with higher hospital mortality among traumatized patients, particularly lower ISS.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521579600000</updated><author><name>Chih-Yuan Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194749</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624480fc8c:30b37c0:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521567726732</crawled><fingerprint>40ed9292</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chih-Yuan Wang, Yi-Chan Chen, Ti-Hsuan Chien, Hao-Yu Chang, Yu-Hsien Chen, Chih-Ying Chien, Ting-Shuo Huang&lt;/p&gt;

More than 90% of the cases of Parkinson’s disease have unknown etiology. Gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra is the main cause of morbidity in this disease. External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes injected with &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite—another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity. A protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 –selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons—is permeable to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Katja Stahl</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194896</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34c0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>76988caa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Katja Stahl, Soulmaz Rahmani, Agnete Prydz, Nadia Skauli, Nanna MacAulay, Maria N.

External factors such as environmental toxins are believed to play a role in the cell loss, although the cause of the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons remains unknown. We have previously shown that aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and astrocytes of rodent brain. AQP9 is permeable to a broad spectrum of substrates including purines, pyrimidines, and lactate, in addition to water and glycerol. Here we test our hypothesis that AQP9 serves as an influx route for exogenous toxins and, hence, may contribute to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase-positive) neurons. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes injected with &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; cRNA, we show that AQP9 is permeable to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Stable expression of AQP9 in HEK cells increases their vulnerability to MPP+ and to arsenite—another parkinsonogenic toxin. Conversely, targeted deletion of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; in mice protects nigral dopaminergic neurons against MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; toxicity. A protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; deletion was demonstrated in organotypic slice cultures of mouse midbrain exposed to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in mice subjected to intrastriatal injections of MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Seven days after intrastriatal MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; injections, the population of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in substantia nigra is reduced by 48% in &lt;i&gt;Aqp9&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice compared with 67% in WT littermates. Our results show that AQP9 –selectively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons—is permeable to MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and suggest that this aquaglyceroporin contributes to the selective vulnerability of nigral dopaminergic neurons by providing an entry route for parkinsonogenic toxins. To our knowledge this is the first evidence implicating a toxin permeable membrane channel in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Targeted deletion of the aquaglyceroporin AQP9 is protective in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01106</originId><author><name>Francesca Citossi, Thomas Smith, Jong Bong Lee, Joel Segal, Pavel Gershkovich, Michael J.

It is generally acknowledged that, for reproducibility and progress of human genomic research, data sharing is critical. For every sharing transaction, a successful data exchange is produced between a data consumer and a data provider. Providers of human genomic data (e.g., publicly or privately funded repositories and data archives) fulfil their social contract with data donors when their shareable data conforms to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles. Based on our experiences via Repositive (https://repositive.io), a leading discovery platform cataloguing all shared human genomic datasets, we propose guidelines for data providers wishing to maximise their shared data’s FAIRness.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RmCLx4LfFZo&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005873</href></item></canonical><engagement>2</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005873</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1622ace2bc4:b9c54d:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521136577476</crawled><fingerprint>5a31606</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Manuel Corpas, Nadezda V.

Background &lt;p&gt;In parturients with increased physiologically intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and a short stature, a greater cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia is often observed after a fixed amount of plain bupivacaine is administered. Therefore, we designed this prospective study to test whether IAP and vertebral column length (VCL) were predictors of spinal spread in parturients undergoing a cesarean section.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 113 parturients, all undergoing elective cesarean sections with single-shot spinal anesthesia, were enrolled. The L3-L4 interspace was entered, and 2 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Upon loss of temperature sensation at the T4 level, IAP was measured through a bladder catheter while the patient was in the supine position with a 10°left lateral tilt. Parturient demographic variables, including age, height, weight, IAP, and VCL were recorded. Linear regressions and multiple regressions were performed to analyze the relationships between parturient variables and the spread of spinal anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 109 parturients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed a significant univariate correlation of height, weight, body mass index (BMI), IAP, and VCL with cephalad spread (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt; 0.004). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Ting-ting Ni</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195137</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>e2e14759</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ting-ting Ni, Ying Zhou, An-cui Yong, Lu Wang, Qing-he Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Multiple linear regression analysis showed that IAP and VCL were the key determinants of spinal spread (both &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), where as exclusion of age, weight, and height did not change the result (all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt; 0.209).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that IAP and VCL were significant predictors of intrathecal spread of plain bupivacaine, and there was a positive association between IAP and abdominal girth in term parturients.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522789200000</published><title>Intra-abdominal pressure, vertebral column length, and spread of spinal anesthesia in parturients undergoing cesarean section: An observational study</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261982v4?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261982v4?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/261982v4?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Methyl-IT, a novel methylome analysis procedure based on information thermodynamics and signal detection was recently released.

Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein specific for &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; and constitutes one of the three main protein antigens of the Bexsero vaccine. Meningococcal and human proteases, cleave NHBA protein upstream or downstream of a conserved Arg-rich region, respectively. The cleavage results in the release of the C-terminal portion of the protein. The C-terminal fragment originating from the processing of meningococcal proteases, referred to as C2 fragment, exerts a toxic effect on endothelial cells altering the endothelial permeability. In this work, we reported that recombinant C2 fragment has no influence on the integrity of human airway epithelial cell monolayers, consistent with previous findings showing that &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; traverses the epithelial barrier without disrupting the junctional structures. We showed that epithelial cells constantly secrete proteases responsible for a rapid processing of C2 fragment, generating a new fragment that does not contain the Arg-rich region, a putative docking domain reported to be essential for C2-mediated toxic effect. Moreover, we found that the C3-convertase of the alternative complement pathway is one of the proteases responsible for this processing. Overall, our data provide new insights on the cleavage of NHBA protein during meningococcal infection. NHBA cleavage may occur at different stages of the infection, and it likely has a different role depending on the environment the bacterium is interacting with.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Martina Di Fede</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194662</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f0:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>90dfc2a8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Di Fede, Massimiliano Biagini, Elena Cartocci, Carlo Parillo, Alessandra Greco, Manuele Martinelli, Sara Marchi, Alfredo Pezzicoli, Isabel Delany, Silvia Rossi Paccani&lt;/p&gt;

Activation of the amino acid starvation response (AAR) increases lifespan and acute stress resistance as well as regulates inflammation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that activation of AAR pharmacologically by Halofuginone (HF) significantly inhibits production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and provides protection from intestinal inflammation in mice. HF inhibits IL-1β through general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2)–dependent activation of the cytoprotective integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, resulting in rerouting of IL-1β mRNA from translationally active polysomes to inactive ribocluster complexes—such as stress granules (SGs)—via recruitment of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) T cell–restricted intracellular antigen-1(TIA-1)/TIA-1–related (TIAR), which are further cleared through induction of autophagy. GCN2 ablation resulted in reduced autophagy and SG formation, which is inversely correlated with IL-1β production. Furthermore, HF diminishes inflammasome activation through suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which IL-1β is regulated by AAR and further suggests that administration of HF might offer an effective therapeutic intervention against inflammatory diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AhBKSDqeXkQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</href></item></canonical><engagement>3</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005317</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16296f3b099:6376e8:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522950975641</crawled><fingerprint>d1fa6099</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Srikanth Battu, Sumbul Afroz, Jeevan Giddaluru, Saima Naz, Weishan Huang, Saratchandra Singh Khumukcham, Rafiq Ahmad Khan, SaleemYousuf Bhat, Insaf Ahmed Qureshi, Bramanandam Manavathi, Aleem Ahmed Khan, Avery August, Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, Nooruddin Khan&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Inability to maintain a stable and beneficial microbiota is associated with chronic gut inflammation, which classically manifests as colitis but may more commonly exist as low-grade inflammation that promotes metabolic syndrome. Alterations in microbiota, and associated inflammation, can originate from dysfunction in host proteins that manage the microbiota, such as the flagellin receptor TLR5. That the complete absence of a microbiota (i.e. germfree conditions) eliminates all evidence of inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice demonstrates that this model of gut inflammation is microbiota-dependent. We hypothesize that such microbiota dependency reflects an inability to manage pathobionts, such as Adherent-Invasive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (AIEC). Herein, we examined the extent to which microbiota mismanagement and associated inflammation in TLR5-deficient mice would manifest in a limited and pathobiont-free microbiota. For this purpose, WT and TLR5-deficient mice were generated and maintained with the 8-member consortium of bacteria referred to as “Altered Schaedler Flora” (ASF). Such ASF animals were subsequently inoculated with AIEC reference strain LF82. Feces were assayed for bacterial loads, fecal lipopolysaccharide and flagellin loads, fecal inflammatory marker lipocalin-2 and microbiota composition.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Relative to similarly maintained WT mice, mice lacking TLR5 (T5KO) did not display low-grade intestinal inflammation nor metabolic syndrome under ASF conditions. Concomitantly, the ASF microbial community was similar between WT and T5KO mice, while inoculation with AIEC strain LF82 resulted in alteration of the ASF community in T5KO mice compared to WT control animals. AIEC LF82 inoculation in ASF T5KO mice resulted in microbiota components having elevated levels of bioactive lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, a modest level of low-grade inflammation and increased adiposity.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In a limited-complexity pathobiont-free microbiota, loss of the flagellin receptor TLR5 does not impact microbiota composition nor its ability to promote inflammation. Addition of AIEC to this ecosystem perturbs microbiota composition, increases levels of lipopolysaccharide and flagellin, but only modestly promotes gut inflammation and adiposity, suggesting that the phenotypes previously associated with loss of this innate immune receptor require disruption of complex microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Benoit Chassaing</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195310</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575f9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>5b02bcfd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benoit Chassaing, Andrew T.

isodesmic reactions were employed. Both the precision of the methods with
respect to the increase of the basis sets, as well as their accuracy, were

performed using the same basis sets as for the DFT methods. The results
obtained employing composite chemical methods (G4, CBS-QB3 and W1BD) were also

successful description of molecular properties (geometries and energies) by
carefully selecting method and basis sets. In general, expansion of the
one-electron basis set to the limit of completeness does not improve results at
the DFT level, but just the opposite. The enthalpies of formation calculated at
the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV6Z for the species

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Variations in the degree of hirsutism among women of different ethnic backgrounds may stem from multiple etiologies. Shorter length of the polymorphic CAG repeats of the &lt;i&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt;) gene may be associated with increased activity of the receptor leading to hirsutism. We hypothesized that there are ethnic differences in the degree of hirsutism that is unrelated to androgen levels among Israeli women, and that the CAG repeats length may contribute to these differences. Anti-androgenic therapies, such as spironolactone, could be suggested if a shorter CAG repeats length is found to affect the difference in the degree of hirsutism between the ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Healthy Israeli Jewish women aged 18–45 years of Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi origin were invited to participate. Hirsutism was assessed using the simplified Ferriman–Gallwey (sFG) score, and serum total testosterone levels were measured as well. The CAG repeats length was determined by PCR. Methylation-sensitive methods were used to detect the fractional activity of each allele, and the weighted mean was calculated for the CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;One-hundred and eight women were recruited (49 Ashkenazi and 59 non-Ashkenazi). The Ashkenazi women had a significantly lower degree of hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), lower mean BMI (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), total testosterone levels (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017), and longer weighted bi-allelic CAG repeats mean (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015) compared to non-Ashkenazi women. For the group as a whole, there was a significant negative correlation between the number of CAG repeats in the &lt;i&gt;AR&lt;/i&gt; gene and the sFG score, while the number of repeats was not related to testosterone levels. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that ethnic origin and the CAG repeats length were the strongest factors affecting hirsutism (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There is a significant difference in the degree of hirsutism between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi women in Israel that is partially explained by CAG repeats length.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Naomi Weintrob</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195046</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f22:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>17eb6b10</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naomi Weintrob, Ori Eyal, Meital Slakman, Anat Segev Becker, Galit Israeli, Ofra Kalter-Leibovici, Shay Ben-Shachar&lt;/p&gt;

The quality of biological samples greatly affects the accuracy of scientific results. However, RNA in cryopreserved tissues gradually degrades during storage, leading to errors in the results of subsequent experiments. A suitable sample preservative solution can prolong storage and enhance the research value of samples. Here, we developed a sample preservative solution using the properties of the ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) and compared its effects on RNA and DNA quality, protein activity, and tissue morphology with the commercially available and widely used RNAlater® Stabilization Solution. The results showed that both the RVC-based preservative solution and RNAlater can effectively delay RNA degradation in tissue samples stored at 4°C or −80°C compared with samples stored without any preservative solution. In contrast to RNAlater, the RVC-based preservative solution did not result in damage to the tissue morphology or a loss of protein activity. Additionally, the RVC-based preservative solution did not affect the RNA and genomic DNA contents of the tissue samples or the results of subsequent experimental analyses. An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Tzong-Ming Shieh</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194393</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a2:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><fingerprint>4fd8268</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tzong-Ming Shieh, Chi-Yuan Chen, Chuen Hsueh, Cheng-Chia Yu, Chin-Chuan Chen, Tong-Hong Wang&lt;/p&gt;

An RVC-based reagent can be used as a multifunctional yet relatively inexpensive tissue preservative solution to provide a comprehensive and cost-effective method for preserving samples for tissue banks.</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Application of ribonucleoside vanadyl complex (RVC) for developing a multifunctional tissue preservative solution</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</originId><published>1523343600000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04257-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parenting methods of elusive caecilians are described.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>109</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162aef7f1ab:1bf4339:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523353907627</crawled><fingerprint>a73657d8</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin, Published online: 10 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04257-3&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04257-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Parenting methods of elusive caecilians are described.</description><engagementRate>0.32</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04257-3/d41586-018-04257-3_15593274.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Legless baby amphibians dine on mother’s skin</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33281</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33281</link><crawled>1522238628331</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522195200000</published><author><name>andrea.ferrario@plymouth.ac.uk (Andrea Ferrario)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33281</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1626c7e21eb:6938e1d:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33281</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>15a7e1c1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Although, in most animals, brain connectivity varies between individuals, behaviour is often similar across a species.

Background &lt;p&gt;A number of studies have investigated cognitive impairment in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) but deficits regarding executive functions have not been comprehensively assessed up to now. This study was meant to explore cognitive impairment in German paediatric MS patients with a focus on deficits in executive functions and relate these to clinical disease parameters.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;Forty paediatric MS patients, which presented at the German centre for MS in childhood and adolescence, were assessed for cognitive deficits applying a very comprehensive battery of cognitive tests including the Wechsler Intelligence scale and subtests of the D-KEFS for executive functions. The performance of MS patients was compared with a group of age and sex matched healthy controls using between-subjects ANOVAs. Paediatric MS patients performed worse in tests assessing verbal comprehension and fluency, processing speed, memory, calculation skills and other executive functions. Arranged by the cognitive domain, group differences were most pronounced regarding verbal comprehension and fluency for the WISC subtests Comprehension (p = 0.000), Vocabulary (p = 0.003) and Information (p = 0.005); regarding processing speed for the written SDMT (p = 0.001) and the WISC subtest Coding (p = 0.005); regarding memory for the VLMT training (p = 0.007) and the BASIC MLT pattern learning training (p = 0.009); regarding executive functions including working memory for the WISC subtest Arithmetics (p = 0.002), the D-KEFS Design Fluency (p = 0.003) and the Corsi block tapping backward task (p = 0.003). Fluid reasoning was largely intact. Relations of cognitive performance and clinical parameters were assessed in MS patients. Disease duration was associated with a reduced performance in tests belonging to the domains verbal comprehension and fluency (WISC Vocabulary: p = 0.034, WISC Information: p = 0.015) and fluid reasoning (WISC Picture Completion: p = 0.003) as well as the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.047). Patients with a disease onset between 11 and 14 years performed better in fluid reasoning (WISC matrix reasoning: p = 0.024) than patients with a disease onset at an age above 14. The number of relapses negatively influenced the visual spatial memory performance (BASIC MLT pattern learning training: p = 0.009).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The distribution of cognitive deficits in a representative group German of paediatric MS patients was similar to the pattern known from other European and North-American cohorts. Paediatric MS patients do have cognitive deficits in executive functions and key qualities necessary for successful school performance. Disease duration, age of onset and the number of relapses influence cognitive performance. Cognitive screenings should be implemented on a regular basis for paediatric MS patients, enabling early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Eva Wuerfel</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194873</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34bd:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>bb9857b5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eva Wuerfel, Almuth Weddige, York Hagmayer, Rebecca Jacob, Lisa Wedekind, Wiebke Stark, Jutta Gärtner&lt;/p&gt;

The large body of work demonstrating hyperthermic impairment of neuromuscular function has utilized maximal isometric contractions, but extrapolating these findings to whole-body exercise and submaximal, dynamic contractions may be problematic. We isolated and compared core and skin temperature influences on an isometric force task versus a position task requiring dynamic maintenance of joint angle. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on the flexor carpi radialis at 60% of baseline maximal voluntary contraction while either pushing against a rigid restraint (force task) or while maintaining a constant wrist angle and supporting an equivalent inertial load (position task). Twenty participants performed each task at 0.5°C rectal temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;) intervals while being passively heated from 37.1±0.3°C to ≥1.5°C T&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; and then cooled to 37.8±0.3°C, permitting separate analyses of core versus skin temperature influences. During a 3-s contraction, trend analysis revealed a quadratic trend that peaked during hyperthermia for root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude during the force task. In contrast, RMS amplitude during the position task remained stable with passive heating, then rapidly increased with the initial decrease in skin temperature at the onset of passive cooling (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.010). Combined hot core and hot skin elicited shifts toward higher frequencies in the sEMG signal during the force task (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), whereas inconsistent changes in the frequency spectra occurred for the position task. Based on the patterns of RMS amplitude in response to thermal stress, we conclude that core temperature was the primary thermal afferent influencing neuromuscular response during a submaximal force task, with minimal input from skin temperature. However, skin temperature was the primary thermal afferent during a position task with minimal core temperature influence. Therefore, temperature has a task-dependent impact on neuromuscular responses.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Nico A.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions.

The UPPS Impulsive Behaviour Scale (with five dimensions of impulsive behaviour) is being widely used. One of the handicaps of this instrument is its relatively long administration time. This has led to the development of a short version: SUPPS-P. There are no studies comparing the relationship between the SUPPS-P scores and the original UPPS-P scores. The objectives of this study, therefore, were to analyse the psychometric properties, concordance of person measures, and efficiency of the SUPPS-P compared to those on UPPS-P, applying an Item Response Theory Model. The UPPS-P and SUPPS-P were administered to 455 undergraduate students. Confirmatory factorial analysis replicated structures reported in previous studies: the five correlated factors structure and the model with two second-order factors (Urgency and Lack of Awareness) with Sensation Seeking dimension as a different factor. Rasch analysis show that both of the instruments presented adequate model-data fit. The results show the measurement for each dimension of UPPS-P offered more precision than SUPPS-P. The structure of items location was maintained in each dimension of SUPPS-P compared to the UPPS-P, but with better person and item separation indices of the UPPS-P dimensions. The concordance analysis reveals high correlations values between scores on both versions. From the standpoint of reducing items, it can be considered that the reduced version is more efficient. This study does not support the equivalence of items on the dimensions of Sensation Seeking and Lack of perseverance.</description><published>1521666000000</published><title>Concordance between the original and short version of the Impulsive Behaviour Scale UPPS-P using an IRT model</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25142?af=R</originId><published>1522120570699</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25142?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25142?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1626574b74b:6ce16:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522120570699</crawled><fingerprint>1bc7750d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley-Blackwell: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, Ahead of Print. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34338</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34338</link><crawled>1522930313724</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522886400000</published><author><name>dickman@usc.edu (Catherine Chen)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34338</canonicalUrl><engagement>61</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16295b869fc:a2b1bf3:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34338</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>b171bdb2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><description>Postsynaptic compartments can be specifically modulated during various forms of synaptic plasticity, but it is unclear whether this precision is shared at presynaptic terminals.

Background &lt;p&gt;Some studies have suggested that depressive disorders may play a vital role in the incidence of hip fractures. However, nationwide data are lacking regarding the association between depressive disorders and hip fractures.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We aimed to explore the association between depressive disorders and new-onset hip fractures.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective study of 11,207 patients with depressive disorders and 11,207 control patients using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the risk of hip fractures in patients with depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The incidence rate ratio of hip fractures between patients with depressive disorders and controls was 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.99, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .001). After adjustment for potential confounders in multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model, patients with depressive disorders were found to have 1.34 times higher risk of hip fractures than controls (95% CI = 1.08–1.66, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = .008).

Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is an incurable and rare hereditary syndrome. In recent times, treatment with glucocorticoid analogues has been shown to improve the neurological symptoms that characterize this condition, but the molecular mechanism of action of these analogues remains unknown. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of action of glucocorticoid analogues in the treatment of A-T by investigating the role of Dexamethasone (Dexa) in A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. We used 2DE and tandem MS to identify proteins that were influenced by the drug in A-T cells but not in healthy cells. Thirty-four proteins were defined out of a total of 746±63. Transcriptome analysis was performed by microarray and showed the differential expression of 599 A-T and 362 wild type (WT) genes and a healthy un-matching between protein abundance and the corresponding gene expression variation. The proteomic and transcriptomic profiles allowed the network pathway analysis to pinpoint the biological and molecular functions affected by Dexamethasone in Dexa-treated cells. The present integrated study provides evidence of the molecular mechanism of action of Dexamethasone in an A-T cellular model but also the broader effects of the drug in other tested cell lines.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Michele Menotta</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195388</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76938:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>622b1adb</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Menotta, Sara Orazi, Anna Maria Gioacchini, Chiara Spapperi, Anastasia Ricci, Luciana Chessa, Mauro Magnani&lt;/p&gt;

The aim of this study was to characterize the urine metabolome of women with &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT) uro-genital infection (n = 21), comparing it with a group of CT-negative subjects (n = 98). By means of a proton-based nuclear magnetic resonance (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR) spectroscopy, we detected and quantified the urine metabolites of a cohort of 119 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, attending a STI Outpatients Clinic in Italy. In case of a CT positive result, CT molecular genotyping was performed by &lt;i&gt;omp1&lt;/i&gt; gene semi-nested PCR followed by RFLP analysis. We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate. In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women.
These results were not influenced by the age of patients nor by the CT serovars (D, E, F, G, K) responsible of the urethral infections. Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability. Peculiar dietary habits of the subjects enrolled, in term of type and amount of food consumed, could probably explain these findings. Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment. Further studies are needed to understand the potential role of these metabolites in the pathogenesis of CT infection, as well as their diagnostic/prognostic use.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Claudio Foschi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194827</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b8:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>1cb5d57a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Claudio Foschi, Luca Laghi, Antonietta D’Antuono, Valeria Gaspari, Chenglin Zhu, Nicolò Dellarosa, Melissa Salvo, Antonella Marangoni&lt;/p&gt;

Plant-growth promotion has been linked to the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; genus since the beginning of this research field. In this work, we mined the genome of an Argentinean isolate of the recently described species &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;donghuensis&lt;/i&gt;. Strain SVBP6, isolated from bulk soil of an agricultural plot, showed a broad antifungal activity and several other plant-probiotic activities. As this species has been recently described, and it seems like some plant-growth promoting (PGP) traits do not belong to the classical pseudomonads toolbox, we decide to explore the SVBP6 genome via an bioinformatic approach. Genome inspection confirmed our previous &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; results about genes involved in several probiotic activities. Other genetic traits possibly involved in survival of SVBP6 in highly competitive environments, such as rhizospheres, were found. Tn&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt; mutagenesis revealed that the antifungal activity against the soil pathogen &lt;i&gt;Macrophomina phaseolina&lt;/i&gt; was dependent on a functional &lt;i&gt;gacS&lt;/i&gt; gene, from the regulatory cascade Gac-Rsm, but it was not due to volatile compounds.

The aim of this study is to disclose the potential bioactive components of &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, a native parasitic natural plant of flora palaestina and to open direction towards new prospective application. GC-MS analysis identified 18 components in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. The most appealing among them are Sesamin and two other phytosterols (Campesterol and Stigmasterol), all of which are documented in the scientific literature for their anticancer activity. Quantitation of Sesamin extracted from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; by HPLC-PDA with the use of three organic solvents showed that the Sesamin content in the methanolic extract was the highest. Following the disclosure of Sesamin presence in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;, we raised the question of whether it is produced naturally in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; or acquired from the host plant. The quantitation of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; was performed while being with five different host plants, and was compared with the amount of Sesamin in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; grown alone. The findings reveal that Sesamin is an endogenous secondary metabolite in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, further studies are required to prove if &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an alternative source of anticancer phytochemicals, mainly Sesamin, and if proteins in the Sesamin production pathway could be valid biological targets for the development of novel and selective pesticides for control/ eradication of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;palaestina&lt;/i&gt; and maybe some other &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta&lt;/i&gt; species.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Vaginal delivery has been recommended for more than ten years for women living with HIV (WLWH) with good virological control. However, in Europe most WLWH still deliver by cesarean section (CS). Our aim was to assess the rate of vaginal delivery and the indications for CS in WLWH over 20 years in a setting of low overall CS rate.&lt;/p&gt; Materials and methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of all WLWH delivering in Finland 1993–2013. We identified the women by combining national health registers and extracted data from patient files.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The study comprised 212 women with 290 deliveries. Over 35% of the women delivered several children during the study years. During 2000–2013, with consistent viral load monitoring, 80.0% showed HIV viral loads &amp;lt;50 copies/mL in the last measurement preceding the delivery. Altogether 74.5% of all WLWH delivered vaginally and the rate of both elective CS and emergency CS was 12.8% each. For most CSs (63.5%) the indication was obstetrical, for 28.4% it was avoiding HIV transmission and for 0.7% it was mother’s request. In hospitals with less than ten HIV-related deliveries during the study period, the rate of elective CS was higher than in more experienced hospitals (22.7% versus 10.6% [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.024]). No perinatal HIV transmissions occurred.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Most WLWH can achieve good virological control and deliver vaginally. This will help them to maintain their future child bearing potential and reduce CS-related morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Inka Aho</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194370</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123922:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>f1ad52a1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Inka Aho, Marja Kaijomaa, Pia Kivelä, Heljä-Marja Surcel, Jussi Sutinen, Oskari Heikinheimo, with the FINHIVPREG Study team &lt;/p&gt;

The study aimed to compare the chronic eccentric-overload training effects of unilateral (lateral lunge) vs bilateral (half-squat) using an inertial device, on hypertrophy and physical performance. Twenty-seven young team sports male players performed a 4 sets of 7 repetitions of inertial eccentric overload training, biweekly for 6 weeks, distributed in unilateral lunge group (UG: age: 22.8 ± 2.9 years; body mass: 75.3 ± 8.8 kg; height: 177.3 ± 3.7 cm) and bilateral squat group (BG: age: 22.6 ± 2.7 years; body mass: 79.5 ± 12.8 kg; height: 164.2 ± 7 cm). Lower limb muscle volume, counter movement jump (CMJ), power with both (POWER), dominant (POWERd) and no-dominant leg (POWERnd), change of direction turn of 90° with dominant (COD90d) and no-dominant leg (COD90nd) and 180° (COD180d and COD180nd), and 10m sprint time (T-10m) were measured pre and post-intervention. The UG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;adductor major&lt;/i&gt; (+11.1%) and &lt;i&gt;vastus medialis&lt;/i&gt; (+12.6%) higher than BG. The BG obtained an increase of &lt;i&gt;vastus lateralis&lt;/i&gt; (+9.9%) and &lt;i&gt;lateral gastrocnemius&lt;/i&gt; (+9.1%) higher than UG. Both groups improved CMJ, POWER, POWERd, POWERnd, COD90 and DEC-COD90, without changes in T-10m. The UG decrease DEC-COD90nd (-21.1%) and BG increase POWER (+38.6%) substantially more than the other group.

Penile acquisition of HIV infection contributes substantially to the global epidemic. Our goal was to establish a preclinical macaque model of penile HIV infection for evaluating the efficacy of new HIV prevention modalities. Rhesus macaques were challenged once or twice weekly with consistent doses of SHIV&lt;sub&gt;sf&lt;/sub&gt;162P3 (a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus containing HIV &lt;i&gt;env&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 4–600 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (50% tissue culture infective dose), via two penile routes, until systemic SHIV infection was confirmed. One route exposed the inner foreskin, glans and urethral os to virus following deposition into the prepuce (foreskin) pouch. The second route introduced the virus non-traumatically into the distal urethra only. Single-route challenges resulted in dose-dependent rates of SHIV acquisition informing selection of optimal SHIV dosing. Concurrent SHIV challenges via the prepuce pouch (200 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) and urethra (16 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) resulted in infection of 100% (10/10) animals following a median of 2.5 virus exposures (range, 1–12). We describe the first rhesus macaque repeat-exposure SHIV challenge model of penile HIV acquisition. Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>David A.

Utilization of the model should further our understanding of penile HIV infection and facilitate the development of new HIV prevention strategies for men.</description><published>1522184400000</published><title>Development of a repeat-exposure penile SHIV infection model in macaques to evaluate biomedical preventions against HIV</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11707</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>196</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11707/20180403/images/medium/jp-2017-11707g_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11707</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/R87_uTqJpAU/acs.jpcb.7b11707</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522728000000</published><author><name>Philipp S.

Tubulin isotypes are known to regulate the stability and dynamics of microtubules, and are also involved in the development of resistance against microtubule-targeted cancer drugs. Indanocine, a potent microtubule depolymerizing agent, is highly active against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells without affecting normal cells. It is known to disrupt microtubule dynamics in cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Indanocine is reported to bind to tubulin at the colchicine site i.e. at the interface of αβ tubulin heterodimer. However, it’s precise binding mode, involved molecular interactions and the binding affinities with different αβ-tubulin isotypes present in MDR cells are not well understood. Here, the binding affinities of human αβ-tubulin isotypes with indanocine were examined, employing the molecular modeling approach i.e. docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculations. Multiple sequence analysis suggests that the amino acid sequences are different in the indanocine binding pockets of βI, βIIa, βIII and βVI isotypes. However, such differences are not observed in the amino acid sequences of βIVa, βIVb, and βV tubulin isotypes at indanocine binding pockets. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation results show that indanocine prefers the interface binding pocket of αβIIa, αβIII, αβIVb, αβV, and αβVI tubulin isotypes; whereas it is expelled from the interface binding pocket of αβIVa and αβI-tubulin isotypes. Further, binding free energy calculations show that αβVI has the highest binding affinity and αβI has the lowest binding affinity for indanocine among all β-tubulin isotypes. The binding free energy decreases in the order of αβVI &gt; αβIVb &gt; αβIIa &gt; αβIII &gt; αβV &gt; αβIVa &gt; αβI. Thus, our study provides a significant understanding of involved molecular interactions of indanocine with tubulin isotypes, which may help to design potent indanocine analogues for specific tubulin isotypes in MDR cells in future.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194934</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f1a:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>6be3d66c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bajarang Vasant Kumbhar, Dulal Panda, Ambarish Kunwar&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD patients.

The oncogenic potential of &lt;i&gt;kni&lt;/i&gt; lies in its ability to activate JAK/STAT signaling and block differentiation. Conversely, tumor growth in &lt;i&gt;ph&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells can be substantially reduced by overexpressing a differentiation factor. This demonstrates that epigenetically derailed tumor conditions can be reversed when targeting key players in the transcriptional network.</content></summary><title>A switch in transcription and cell fate governs the onset of an epigenetically-deregulated tumor in Drosophila</title></item><item><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Radiocarbon_14C_Concentration_of_Local_Pollution_in_Street_Trees_Located_at_Intersections/5970868</originId><published>1520899200000</published><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Radiocarbon_14C_Concentration_of_Local_Pollution_in_Street_Trees_Located_at_Intersections/5970868</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><unread>False</unread><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Radiocarbon_14C_Concentration_of_Local_Pollution_in_Street_Trees_Located_at_Intersections/5970868</link><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_1621fb452ac:4b0c20:34f43e70</id><crawled>1520950334124</crawled><fingerprint>f8879512</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><description>At large intersections, vehicles consume and generate a large amount of fossil fuel.

This analysis reveals for the first time the potential of a crowdsourcing approach to uncover covert patient sub populations, and to accelerate disease understanding and therapeutic development.</description><published>1522911600000</published><title>Stratification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: a crowdsourcing approach [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2624.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2624.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/E2624.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG expansion in the ATXN3 gene leading to a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein.

The spatial heterogeneity of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity pose a great challenge to accurately estimate the carbon flux in global carbon cycling, which has primarily been researched in flatlands versus hillslope ecosystems. On an eroded slope (35°) of the semiarid Loess Plateau, soil respiration, soil moisture and soil temperature were measured &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; at upper and lower slope positions in triplicate from 2014 until 2016, and the soil biochemical and microbial properties were determined. The results showed that soil respiration was significantly greater (by 44.2%) at the lower slope position (2.6 μmol m&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) than at the upper slope position, as were soil moisture, carbon, nitrogen fractions and root biomass. However, the temperature sensitivity was 13.2% greater at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The soil fungal community changed from being Basidiomycota-dominant at the upper slope position to being Zygomycota-dominant at the lower slope position, corresponding with increased β-D-glucosidase activity at the upper slope position than at the lower slope position. We concluded that soil respiration was enhanced by the greater soil moisture, root biomass, carbon and nitrogen contents at the lower slope position than at the upper slope position. Moreover, the increased soil respiration and decreased temperature sensitivity at the lower slope position were partially due to copiotrophs replacing oligotrophs. Such spatial variations along slopes must be properly accounted for when estimating the carbon budget and feedback of future climate change on hillslope ecosystems.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Qiqi Sun</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195400</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd077:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>767ae66b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiqi Sun, Rui Wang, Yaxian Hu, Lunguang Yao, Shengli Guo&lt;/p&gt;

The theory has been that these are always going to be in there fighting against your efforts to kill off the downstream tumor cells, so unless you find a way to target them, you’re not going to be successful. As that blog post shows, though, this area was imperfectly understood at the time, and it has not gotten a great deal more clear since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company that I wrote about, though, Stemcentrx, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/04/28/stemcentrx-scooped-up&quot;&gt;bought a few months later&lt;/a&gt; by AbbVie for &lt;em&gt;5.8 billion dollars in cash&lt;/em&gt; (and promises of about four billion more if things worked out). At the time, I wrote (uncontroversially, I think) that “this deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid”. The lead program out of this deal, Rova-T, is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4934375/&quot;&gt;antibody-drug&lt;/a&gt; conjugate (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rovalpituzumab_tesirine&quot;&gt;rovalpituzumab tesirine&lt;/a&gt;) which was aimed at small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), specifically the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL3&quot;&gt;DLL3&lt;/a&gt; protein found on the surface of some cell types. The antibody targets DLL, and the conjugate has a cleavable linker that delivers a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer as a DNA-damaging payload. SCLC is bad news, so any advances in this field would be welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on in 2016, AbbVie &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/abbvie-turns-its-first-card-bold-10b-gamble-rova-t&quot;&gt;presented data&lt;/a&gt; from a small trial (I believe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(16)30565-4/fulltext&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) that showed that response rates did seem to correlate with DLL3 expression. But the rates themselves were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2016/06/05/abbvies-new-lung-cancer-drug-may-extend-patients-lives-but-could-disappoint-investors/#64bce5bf7c53&quot;&gt;not all that impressive&lt;/a&gt;, in the larger scheme of things, and overall, people didn’t seem very impressed. AbbVie pushed on, though, seeking accelerated approval from the FDA, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://endpts.com/abbvie-shares-tank-on-rova-t-flop-retreat-from-accelerated-approval-pitch/&quot;&gt;today we have the latest results&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately. The company reported the response rate from the DLL3-high patient group, and it’s only 16% (which is the same or worse than standard of care response rates), and the survival data are not impressive, either. &lt;em&gt;(Update: it’s quite likely that this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://epvantage.com/Universal/View.aspx?type=Story&amp;id=774872&amp;isEPVantage=yes&quot;&gt;even worse&lt;/a&gt; than it seems!)&lt;/em&gt; The stock market is not taking this well. ABBV is down $12 a share as I write, which takes out nearly $20 billion dollars of market cap from the stock. The fear is that if this is the DLL3-high group, which is supposed to be the best of the bunch, what are the full Phase 3 results going to look like? Forget about accelerated approval – AbbVie sure has to – what are the chances that this program works well enough to be approved at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also puts a bit of a hole in the cancer-stem-cell idea in general. It’s a complicated enough field that you’re not going to disprove it with a single agent or in a single type of cancer, but this does show that it’s not even as straightforward as it looks (and it didn’t look that straightforward!) As for this specific approach, and this specific deal, well. . .I suppose things could change eventually, but for now, it’s a disaster. We’ll see what AbbVie does after the full data come out. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/03/22/peter-thiel-backed-a-biotech-big-pharma-bought-it-it-blew-up/#4e92563d301f&quot;&gt;Matthew Herper’s take&lt;/a&gt; on this is well worth reading.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;The paced serial addition test (PSAT) is regularly used to assess cognitive deficits in various neuropsychiatric conditions. Being a complex test, it reflects the status of multiple cognitive domains such as working memory, information processing speed and executive functioning. Two versions of the PSAT exist. One uses auditory stimuli through spoken numbers and is known as the PASAT, while the other one presents patients with visual stimuli and is called PVSAT. The PASAT is considered more frustrating by patients, and hence the visual version is usually preferred. Research has suggested that an interference might exist between patients’ verbal answers and the auditory presentation of stimuli. We therefore removed the verbal response in this study, and aimed to investigate differences in functional brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Fifteen healthy controls performed the two test versions inside an MRI scanner—switching between stimulus modality (auditory vs. visual) as well as inter-stimulus frequency (3s vs. 2s). We extracted 11 independent components from the data: attentional, visual, auditory, sensorimotor and default mode networks. We then performed statistical analyses of mean network activity within each component, as well as inter-network connectivity of each component pair during the different task types.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, we noted an effect of modality on activity in the visual and auditory components. However, we also describe bilateral frontoparietal, anterior cingulate and insular attentional network activity. An effect of frequency was noted only in the sensorimotor network. Effects were found on edges linking visual and auditory regions. Task modality influenced an attentional-sensorimotor connection, while stimulus frequency had an influence on sensorimotor-default mode connections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Scanner noise during functional MRI may interfere with brain activation—especially during tasks involving auditory pathways. The question whether to use PVSAT or PASAT for an fMRI study is, therefore, an important one. Specific effects of both modalities should be known to study designers. We conclude that both tests should not be considered interchangeable, as significant changes were brought to light during test performance in different modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Jeroen Gielen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194388</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e1c:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>f61a8083</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jeroen Gielen, Wietse Wiels, Jeroen Van Schependom, Jorne Laton, Wim Van Hecke, Paul M.

Detailed knowledge of how a rider’s seating style and riding on a circle influences the movement symmetry of the horse’s head and pelvis may aid rider and trainer in an early recognition of low grade lameness. Such knowledge is also important during both subjective and objective lameness evaluations in the ridden horse in a clinical setting. In this study, inertial sensors were used to assess how different rider seating styles may influence head and pelvic movement symmetry in horses trotting in a straight line and on the circle in both directions. A total of 26 horses were subjected to 15 different conditions at trot: three unridden conditions and 12 ridden conditions where the rider performed three different seating styles (rising trot, sitting trot and two point seat). Rising trot induced systematic changes in movement symmetry of the horses. The most prominent effect was decreased pelvic rise that occurred as the rider was actively rising up in the stirrups, thus creating a downward momentum counteracting the horses push off. This mimics a push off lameness in the hindlimb that is in stance when the rider sits down in the saddle during the rising trot. On the circle, the asymmetries induced by rising trot on the correct diagonal counteracted the circle induced asymmetries, rendering the horse more symmetrical. This finding offers an explanation to the equestrian tradition of rising on the ‘correct diagonal.’ In horses with small pre-existing movement asymmetries, the asymmetry induced by rising trot, as well as the circular track, attenuated or reduced the horse’s baseline asymmetry, depending on the sitting diagonal and direction on the circle. A push off hindlimb lameness would be expected to increase when the rider sits during the lame hindlimb stance whereas an impact hindlimb lameness would be expected to decrease. These findings suggest that the rising trot may be useful for identifying the type of lameness during subjective lameness assessment of hindlimb lameness. This theory needs to be studied further in clinically lame horses.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Emma Persson-Sjodin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195341</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4615:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>b3a0b371</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emma Persson-Sjodin, Elin Hernlund, Thilo Pfau, Pia Haubro Andersen, Marie Rhodin&lt;/p&gt;

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping), to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering miRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn&apos;s disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p_rs102275=1.44e-20, p_rs968567=2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p=5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both miRNAs (all with p&amp;lt;0.05). In summary, our study points towards a pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Wohlers, I.</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/04/286260</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16291cb2608:9ee96b1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522864432648</crawled><fingerprint>2089d19e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><description>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases. However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context.

To this end, we performed microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether lyophilized human platelet lysate (HPL) powder can preserve the growth factor concentrations and epitheliotrophic properties of liquid HPL, and potentially be used as a clinically-friendly treatment option.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Two commercialized liquid HPLs, UltraGRO TM (Helios, Atlanta, GA) and PLTMax (Mill Creek, Rochester, MI), were obtained and converted to lyophilized powder. After redissolution, lyophilized powder HPLs were compared with liquid HPLs, as well as human peripheral serum (HPS) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) in liquid or redissolved lyophilized powder forms. Concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Human corneal epithelial cell line was incubated with the blood derivatives and evaluated for cell migration with scratch-induced directional wounding and proliferation with MTS assays. Cell differentiation was examined by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Fluorescein staining and in vivo confocal microscopy were used to evaluate in vivo corneal epithelial wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats that underwent corneal debridement and topical application of liquid and redissolved powder HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Liquid form and redissolved lyophilized powder form HPLs had similar concentrations of EGF, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments on cell migration, proliferation and differentiation and rat models on wound healing demonstrated no significant difference between the liquid and redissolved lyophilized powder forms for HPLs, HPS and FBS. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; confocal microscopy revealed similar wound healing process at different layers of cornea after corneal epithelial debridement between liquid form and redissolved lyophilized power form of HPLs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The redissolved lyophilized powder form of both commercialized HPLs showed similar growth factor concentrations and corneal epitheliotrophic abilities compared to the liquid form.

Psychological and other persuasive mechanisms across diverse contexts are well researched, with many studies of the effectiveness of specific persuasive techniques on distinct types of human behaviour. In the present paper, our specific interest lies in the development of a generalized modular psychometric tool to measure individuals’ susceptibility to persuasion. The scale is constructed using items from previously developed and validated particulate scales established in the domains of social psychology and behavioural economics. In the first study we establish the Susceptibility to Persuasion–II (StP-II) scale, containing 54 items, 10 subscales and further 6 sub-sub scales. In Study 2 we establish the scale’s construct validity and reconfirm its reliability. We present a valid and reliable modular psychometric tool that measures general susceptibility to persuasive techniques. Since its inception, we have successfully implemented the StP-II scale to measure susceptibility to persuasion of IT security officers, the role of psychology of persuasion in cybercrime victims and general persuadability levels of Facebook users; these manuscripts are in preparation. We argue that the StP-II scale shows promise in measuring individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, and is applicable across diverse contexts such as Internet security and cybercrime.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>David Modic</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194119</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e03:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>1dbc5c5f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Modic, Ross Anderson, Jussi Palomäki&lt;/p&gt;

Sepsis is characterized by an intense systemic inflammatory response activating a cascade of proinflammatory events resulting in leukocyte dysregulation and host tissue damage. The lung is particularly susceptible to systemic inflammation, leading to acute lung injury. Key to inflammation-induced lung damage is the excessive migration of neutrophils across the vascular endothelium. The mechanisms which regulate neutrophil activation and migration in sepsis are not well defined but there is growing evidence that platelets are actively involved and play a key role in microvascular permeability and neutrophil-mediated organ damage. We previously identified PKC-delta (PKCδ) as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in sepsis and demonstrated PKCδ inhibition was lung protective. However, the role of PKCδ in sepsis-induced platelet activation and platelet-leukocyte interactions is not known. In this study, rats underwent sham surgery or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to induce sepsis. Following surgeries, a PKCδ inhibitor (200μg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) was administered intra-tracheally. At 24 hours post-surgeries, lung tissue, BAL fluid, and blood samples were collected. While sepsis caused thrombocytopenia, the remaining circulating platelets were activated as demonstrated by increased p-selectin expression, elevated plasma PF4, and enhanced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation compared to Sham animals. Platelet activation was associated with increased platelet PKCδ activity. Inhibition of PKCδ attenuated sepsis-induced platelet activation, secretion and aggregate formation. Sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia was also significantly reduced and circulating platelet numbers were similar to sham animals. In the lung, sepsis induced significant influx of platelets and neutrophils and the development of lung injury. Administration of the PKCδ inhibitor decreased platelet and neutrophil influx, and was lung protective. Thus, PKCδ inhibition modulated platelet activity both locally and systemically, decreased neutrophil influx into the lung, and was lung protective. We demonstrate for the first time that PKCδ plays an important role in platelet activation and platelet-neutrophil interaction during sepsis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Elisabetta Liverani</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195379</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575fe:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>386aa806</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Elisabetta Liverani, Mark J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01). The disease activity score was negatively associated with step length and gait speed (step length, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 3). 26% of patients with good HAQ scores showed slow gait speed. Patients with good HAQ scores and slow gait speed had higher disease activity scores (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and lower knee extension strength (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) than those with good HAQ scores and normal gait speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;High knee extension strength, low disease activity and administration of methotrexate were strongly associated with good walking ability in female patients with RA.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine the factors associated with gait parameters in female patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The gait analysis was performed in a large cohort of RA patients, and three basic gait parameters (step length, cadence and gait speed) were calculated. Clinical and laboratory data were also collected. Factors associated with gait parameters were analyzed using multivariable linear regression in the three models with forced entry. Then, we divided those patients with Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ) scores ≤ 0.5 into two groups according to their gait speed that were compared to identify the characteristics of patients with a good HAQ score but poor walking ability.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 318 female patients were analyzed. Knee extension strength had the strongest positive association with all three gait parameters (P &amp;lt; 0.0001), while methotrexate use was also positively associated with all three gait parameters (step length: P &amp;lt; 0.05, cadence: P &amp;lt; 0.05 in model 1 and 2; P &amp;lt; 0.01 in model 3, gait speed: P &amp;lt; 0.01).

Recent advances suggest that impairment in social cognition (SC) may play a role in the development of social anxiety (SA). However, very few studies have analyzed whether SA fosters poorer social-cognitive development as it leads to social avoidance. This study aimed to analyze whether retrospectively assessed behavioral inhibition (BI) (i.e., an early form of SA) in childhood is associated with a deficit in social cognition operationalized as impairment of mentalizing (MZ) in adolescence. A sample of 256 adolescents (range: 12–18 years; mean age: 14.7 years; &lt;i&gt;SD&lt;/i&gt; = 1.7) from general population were assessed for MZ capacities and retrospective BI through self-report and interview measures. Results comparing three groups of adolescents with different levels of childhood BI (low, moderate or high) and controlling for concurrent SA and depression reveal that the higher the level of BI, the lower the level of MZ. These results were consistent for almost all mentalization measures, including when both extreme (i.e., high vs. low BI) and non-extreme (i.e., high vs. moderate BI) were compared in both self-report and interview measures and in both dimensions of MZ (i.e., MZ referred to others’ and to own mental states). These findings support that childhood forms of SA are associated to deficit in SC in adolescence. A possible bi-directional relationship between SA and SC, and the role that it may play in the pathway to clinical SA are discussed.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Sergi Ballespí</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195303</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde36:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>e784a6d6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sergi Ballespí, Ariadna Pérez-Domingo, Jaume Vives, Carla Sharp, Neus Barrantes-Vidal&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Chlamydia trachomatis&lt;/i&gt; (CT), a test of cure (TOC) within 3–5 weeks is not recommended. International guidelines differ in advising a &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt; (NG) TOC. Retesting CT and NG positives within 3–12 months is recommended in international guidelines. We assessed TOC and retesting practices including extragenital testing in general practitioner (GP) practices located in different socioeconomic status (SES) areas to inform and optimize local test practices.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Laboratory data of 48 Dutch GP practices between January 2011 and July 2016 were used. Based on a patient’s first positive CT or NG test, the proportion of TOC (&amp;lt;3 months) and retests (3–12 months) were calculated. Patient- and GP-related factors were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For CT (n = 622), 20% had a TOC and 24% had a retest at the GP practice. GP practices in low SES areas were more likely to perform a CT TOC (OR:1.8;95%CI:1.1–3.1). Younger patients (&amp;lt;25 years) were more likely to have a CT TOC (OR:1.6;95%CI:1.0–2.4). For CT (n = 622), 2.4% had a TOC and 6.1% had a retest at another STI care provider. For NG (n = 73), 25% had a TOC and 15% had a retest at the GP practice. For NG (n = 73), 2.7% had a TOC and 12.3% had a retest at another STI care provider. In only 0.3% of the consultations patients were tested on extragenital sites.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Almost 20% of the patients returned for a CT TOC, especially at GP practices in low SES areas. For NG, 1 out of 4 patients returned for a TOC. Retesting rates were low for both CT (24%) and NG (15%), (re)infections including extragenital infections may be missed. Efforts are required to focus TOC and increase retesting practices of GPs in order to improve CT/NG control.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Juliën N.

Pain relief always plays the essential part of perioperative care and an important role of medical quality improvement. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is a method that allows a patient to self-administer small boluses of analgesic to relieve the subjective pain. PCA logs from the infusion pump consisted of a lot of text messages which record all events during the therapies. The dosage information can be extracted from PCA logs to provide easily understanding features. The analysis of dosage information with time has great help to figure out the variance of a patient’s pain relief condition. To explore the trend of pain relief requirement, we developed a PCA dosage information generator (PCA DIG) to extract meaningful messages from PCA logs during the first 48 hours of therapies. PCA dosage information including consumption, delivery, infusion rate, and the ratio between demand and delivery is presented with corresponding values in 4 successive time frames.

Human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3) proteins are a family of cytidine deaminases that catalyze the conversion of deoxycytidine (dC) to deoxyuridine (dU) in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A3 proteins act in the innate immune response to viral infection by mutating the viral ssDNA. One of the most well-studied human A3 family members is A3G, which is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1. Each A3 protein prefers a specific substrate sequence for catalysis—for example, A3G deaminates the third dC in the CCCA sequence motif. However, the interaction between A3G and ssDNA is difficult to characterize due to poor solution behavior of the full-length protein and loss of DNA affinity of the truncated protein. Here, we present a novel DNA-anchoring fusion strategy using the protection of telomeres protein 1 (Pot1) which has nanomolar affinity for ssDNA, with which we captured an A3G-ssDNA interaction. We crystallized a non-preferred adenine in the -1 nucleotide-binding pocket of A3G. The structure reveals a unique conformation of the catalytic site loops that sheds light onto how the enzyme scans substrate in the -1 pocket. Furthermore, our biochemistry and virology studies provide evidence that the nucleotide-binding pockets on A3G influence each other in selecting the preferred DNA substrate. Together, the results provide insights into the mechanism by which A3G selects and deaminates its preferred substrates and help define how A3 proteins are tailored to recognize specific DNA sequences. This knowledge contributes to a better understanding of the mechanism of DNA substrate selection by A3G, as well as A3G antiviral activity against HIV-1.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Samantha J.

Background &lt;p&gt;Since 1946 the controlled human infection model (CHIM) for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; has been used to improve understanding of disease pathogenesis, describe clinical and immunologic responses to infection and as a tool for vaccine development. As the frequency and intent for use in vaccine comparisons increases, standardization of the primary endpoint definition is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Subject-level data were obtained from previously conducted experimental &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM studies. Signs and symptoms severity were categorized consistently across all studies. Sign and symptom correlations were estimated and univariate models were utilized to describe the association between stool output and other &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;-attributable signs and symptoms. Multiple correspondence and hierarchical clustering analyses were performed to describe the co-occurrence of signs and symptoms. A disease score is proposed based on the co-occurrence of these events.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Data were obtained on 54 subjects receiving 800 to 2000 colony forming units (cfu) of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;flexneri&lt;/i&gt;. The median maximum 24 hour stool output was 514 ml (IQR: 300, 998 ml) with a median frequency of 6 (IQR: 4, 9). Subjects reported abdominal pain or cramps (81.5%), headache (66.7%) and anorexia (64.8%), 50.0% had a fever and 27.8% had gross blood in multiple loose stools. Multiple correspondence analyses highlighted co-occurrence of symptoms based on severity. A 3-parameter disease severity score predicted shigellosis endpoints and better differentiated disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Dichotomous endpoints for &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; CHIM fail to fully account for disease variability. An ordinal disease score characterizing the breadth of disease severity may enable a better characterization of shigellosis and can decrease sample size requirements.

Childhood traumas, in the form of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and neglect, are globally widespread and highly prevalent, and associated with a range of subsequent poor health outcomes. This study sought to understand the relationship between physical, sexual and emotional childhood abuse and subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people (18–30) living in urban informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. Data came from self-completed questionnaires amongst 680 women and 677 men comprising the baseline of the Stepping Stones and Creating Futures intervention trial. Men and women were analysed separately. Logistic regression models assessed the relationship between six HIV-risk behaviours and four measures of trauma: the form of trauma, the severity of each trauma, the range of traumas, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Childhood traumas were incredibly prevalent in this population. All childhood traumas were associated with a range of HIV-risk behaviours. This was for the ever/never trauma, as well as the severity of each type of trauma, the range of trauma, and overall severity of childhood trauma. Despite the wider harsh contexts of urban informal settlements, childhood traumas still play a significant role in shaping subsequent HIV-risk behaviours amongst young people. Interventions to reduce childhood traumas for populations in informal settlements need to be developed. In addition, trauma focused therapies need to be considered as part of wider HIV-prevention interventions for young adults.

The mechanical environment is a primary factor in the success of distraction osteogenesis. It is known that the interfragmentary movement during the distraction and maturation phase effects the callus formation. In addition to cyclic compression, other movements like shear and bending influence the bone formation process as shown in previous callus distraction studies. Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Julian Schuelke</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195466</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07c:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>53f003d2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Julian Schuelke, Nicholaus Meyers, Sandra Reitmaier, Svenja Klose, Anita Ignatius, Lutz Claes&lt;/p&gt;

Reports of cartilage presence and endochondral ossification in the regenerative zone have been associated with a lack of fixation stability and delayed healing. So far the effects of the direction of interfragmentary movements could not be studied separately. By means of a unique lateral callus distraction model, we investigated the effects of small (0.1 mm) and moderate (0.6 mm), purely axial compression on ossification during callus maturation in sheep. A distraction device incorporating a mobile titanium plate was mounted on the tibia. Following lateral callus distraction, electromechanically controlled movements allowed purely axial cyclic compression of the tissue regenerate. Seven weeks post-operatively, the tissue regenerates were investigated using μCT, histology and immunohistochemistry. The larger amplitude significantly increased bone formation (Fractional bone volume: 19.4% vs. 5.2%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; trabecular thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.06 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; mean spicule height: 2.6 mm vs. 1.1 mm, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02) however, no endochondral ossification occurred. The elimination of shear movement, unimpaired neovascularization as well as the tensile strain stimuli during the distraction phase suppressing chondrogenic differentiation may all contribute to the absence of cartilage. In clinical application of distraction osteogenesis, moderate axial interfragmentary movement augments intramembranous ossification provided shear strain is minimized.</description><published>1523048400000</published><title>Intramembranous bone formation after callus distraction is augmented by increasing axial compressive strain</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194215</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194215</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194215</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tomiko Yakura, Hiroki Yokota, Yusuke Ohmichi, Mika Ohmichi, Takashi Nakano, Munekazu Naito&lt;/p&gt;
Several recent studies have claimed that rodents have good visual recognition abilities. However, the extent to which rats can recognize other rats and distinguish between males and females using visual information alone remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the ability of rats to visually recognize mirror, video-recorded, and still images and to discriminate between images of males and females. Rats were tested in a place preference apparatus with a mirror, a video-recorded image of a rat, or a still image of a rat at one end. The data were assessed using t-test with Bonferroni correction. Male and female rats spent significantly more time in the mirror chamber and the video-recorded image chamber than in their respective blank chambers (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and male rats also spent more time in the chamber containing a still image. Furthermore, it was found that male rats exhibited significantly more sniffing behavior around the mirror than in the blank chamber (P &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas female rats were no significant differences in the sniffing behaviors in the mirror, moving or still image experiments. Identical results were obtained regardless of whether the rat in the image was the same or opposite sex. These results indicate that rats can process the differences in mirror, video-recorded, and still images as visual information, but are unable to use this information to distinguish between the sexes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1520974800000</updated><author><name>Tomiko Yakura</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194215</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622071b412:5f4d63:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1520962745362</crawled><fingerprint>f75b5390</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomiko Yakura, Hiroki Yokota, Yusuke Ohmichi, Mika Ohmichi, Takashi Nakano, Munekazu Naito&lt;/p&gt;

Social medical insurance schemes are crucial for realizing universal health coverage and health equity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how reimbursement for injury-induced medical expenses is addressed in Chinese legislative documents relevant to social medical insurance. We retrieved legislative documents from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Lawyee databases. Four types of social medical insurance schemes were included: urban employee basic medical insurance, urban resident basic medical insurance, new rural cooperative medical system, and urban and rural resident medical insurance. Text analyses were conducted on all identified legislative documents. As a result, one national law and 1,037 local legislative documents were identified. 1,012 of the 1,038 documents provided for reimbursement. Of the 1,012 documents, 828 (82%) provided reimbursement only for injuries without a legally responsible person/party or not caused by self-harm, alcohol use, drug use, or other law violations, and 162 (16%) did not include any details concerning implementation. Furthermore, 760 (92%) of the 828 did not provide an exception clause applying to injuries when a responsible person/party could not be contacted or for situations when the injured person cannot obtain reimbursement from the responsible person/party. Thus, most Chinese legislative documents related to social medical insurance do not provide reimbursement for medical expenses from injuries having a legally responsible person/party or those caused by illegal behaviors. We argue that all injury-induced medical expenses should be covered by legislative documents related to social medical insurance in China, no matter what the cause of the injury. Further research is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of such policy changes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Yuyan Gao</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194381</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e1a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>185e86e6</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuyan Gao, Li Li, David C.

Further research is needed to explore the acceptability and feasibility of such policy changes.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Reimbursement for injury-induced medical expenses in Chinese social medical insurance schemes: A systematic analysis of legislative documents</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3326.short?rss=1</originId><author><name>NA</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3326.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>PLANT BIOLOGY Correction for “AtsPLA2-α nuclear relocalization by the Arabidopsis transcription factor AtMYB30 leads to repression of the plant defense response,” by Solène Froidure, Joanne Canonne, Xavier Daniel, Alain Jauneau, Christian Brière, Dominique Roby, and Susana Rivas, which was first published August 9, 2010; 10.1073/pnas.1009056107 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA...</content></content><published>1522774667000</published><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3326</canonicalUrl><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3326.short?rss=1</link><id>wZynN7RQGPHgjTdydiqpMF51Sf3pGuJOJMLwOJPSPmQ=_1628cac297a:9554bae:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522778515834</crawled><fingerprint>7f22314</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><description>PLANT BIOLOGY Correction for “AtsPLA2-α nuclear relocalization by the Arabidopsis transcription factor AtMYB30 leads to repression of the plant defense response,” by Solène Froidure, Joanne Canonne, Xavier Daniel, Alain Jauneau, Christian Brière, Dominique Roby, and Susana Rivas, which was first published August 9, 2010; 10.1073/pnas.1009056107 (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA...</description><visual><width>413</width><contentType>image/gif</contentType><height>440</height><url>http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/14/E3326/F1.medium.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Correction for Froidure et al., AtsPLA2-{alpha} nuclear relocalization by the Arabidopsis transcription factor AtMYB30 leads to repression of the plant defense response [Correction]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194983</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194983</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194983</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Alberto Fernández-Villar, Cristina Represas-Represas, Cecilia Mouronte-Roibás, Cristina Ramos-Hernández, Ana Priegue-Carrera, Sara Fernández-García, José Luis López-Campos&lt;/p&gt;
Objectives &lt;p&gt;Although not currently recommended, spirometry during hospitalization due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an opportunity to enhance the diagnosis of this disease.

Background &lt;p&gt;The management of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with rate-lowering or anti-arrhythmic drugs has markedly changed over the last decade, but it is unknown how these changes have affected patients with NVAF with a permanent pacemaker (PPM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Through Danish nationwide registries, patients with NVAF and a PPM were identified from 2001 to 2012. Changes in concomitant pharmacotherapy and comorbidities were tested using the Cochran–Armitage trend test and linear regression. Patients with NVAF were identified to calculate the proportional amount of PPM implants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 12,231 NVAF patients with a PPM were included in the study, 55.6% of which were men. Median age was 78 years (interquartile range 70–84). From 2001 to 2012, the number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased from 850 to 1344, while the number of NVAF patients increased from 67,478 to 127,261. Thus, the proportional amount of NVAF patients with a PPM decreased from 1.3% to 1.1% (p = 0.015). Overall 45.9% had atrial fibrillation (AF) duration less than one year and the proportion declined from 55.5% to 42.4% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Diabetes mellitus increased from 7.2% to 16.8% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Heart failure (HF) decreased from 36.7% to 29.3% (p = 0.010) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) decreased from 32.4% to 26.1% (p &amp;lt;0.001). Beta-blocker use increased from 38.1% to 58.0% (p &amp;lt;0.001), while digoxin and anti-arrhythmic drug use decreased over time.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;From 2001 to 2012, the absolute number of NVAF patients with a PPM increased while the proportional amount decreased. The number of NVAF patients receiving a PPM within one year of AF diagnosis decreased. The prevalence of DM increased, while the prevalence of HF and IHD was high but decreasing.

We sought to identify biomarkers which delineated individual hypertrophic responses to resistance training. Untrained, college-aged males engaged in full-body resistance training (3 d/wk) for 12 weeks. Body composition via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL) thickness via ultrasound, blood, VL muscle biopsies, and three-repetition maximum (3-RM) squat strength were obtained prior to (PRE) and following (POST) 12 weeks of training. K-means cluster analysis based on VL thickness changes identified LOW [n = 17; change (mean±SD) = +0.11±0.14 cm], modest (MOD; n = 29, +0.40±0.06 cm), and high (HI; n = 21, +0.69±0.14 cm) responders. Biomarkers related to histology, ribosome biogenesis, proteolysis, inflammation, and androgen signaling were analyzed between clusters. There were main effects of time (POST&gt;PRE, p&amp;lt;0.05) but no cluster×time interactions for increases in DXA lean body mass, type I and II muscle fiber cross sectional area and myonuclear number, satellite cell number, and macronutrients consumed. Interestingly, PRE VL thickness was ~12% greater in LOW versus HI (p = 0.021), despite POST values being ~12% greater in HI versus LOW (p = 0.006). However there was only a weak correlation between PRE VL thickness scores and change in VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.114, p = 0.005). Forced post hoc analysis indicated that muscle total RNA levels (i.e., ribosome density) did not significantly increase in the LOW cluster (351±70 ng/mg to 380±62, p = 0.253), but increased in the MOD (369±115 to 429±92, p = 0.009) and HI clusters (356±77 to 470±134, p&amp;lt;0.001; POST HI&gt;POST LOW, p = 0.013). Nonetheless, there was only a weak association between change in muscle total RNA and VL thickness (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.079, p = 0.026). IL-1β mRNA levels decreased in the MOD and HI clusters following training (p&amp;lt;0.05), although associations between this marker and VL thickness changes were not significant (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0002, p = 0.919). In conclusion, individuals with lower pre-training VL thickness values and greater increases muscle total RNA levels following 12 weeks of resistance training experienced greater VL muscle growth, although these biomarkers individually explained only ~8–11% of the variance in hypertrophy.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Christopher B.

According to advancements in the wireless technologies, study of biometrics-based multi-server authenticated key agreement schemes has acquired a lot of momentum. Recently, Wang et al. presented a three-factor authentication protocol with key agreement and claimed that their scheme was resistant to several prominent attacks. Unfortunately, this paper indicates that their protocol is still vulnerable to the user impersonation attack, privileged insider attack and server spoofing attack. Furthermore, their protocol cannot provide the perfect forward secrecy.

According to advancements in the wireless technologies, study of biometrics-based multi-server authenticated key agreement schemes has acquired a lot of momentum. Recently, Wang et al. presented a three-factor authentication protocol with key agreement and claimed that their scheme was resistant to several prominent attacks. Unfortunately, this paper indicates that their protocol is still vulnerable to the user impersonation attack, privileged insider attack and server spoofing attack. Furthermore, their protocol cannot provide the perfect forward secrecy. As a remedy of these aforementioned problems, we propose a biometrics-based authentication and key agreement scheme for multi-server environments. Compared with various related schemes, our protocol achieves the stronger security and provides more functionality properties. Besides, the proposed protocol shows the satisfactory performances in respect of storage requirement, communication overhead and computational cost. Thus, our protocol is suitable for expert systems and other multi-server architectures. Consequently, the proposed protocol is more appropriate in the distributed networks.</description><published>1520974800000</published><title>Cryptanalysis and improvement of a biometrics-based authentication and key agreement scheme for multi-server environments</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029272?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029272?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029272?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/12&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 12&lt;/a&gt;, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1521694886000</published><author><name>Dongzheng Yang</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1626b77e966:66f88ee:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522221443430</crawled><fingerprint>2c97caa5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 12, March 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Publisher’s Note: “An improved coupled-states approximation including the           nearest neighbor Coriolis couplings for diatom-diatom inelastic collision” [J.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To analyze the correlation between structural characteristics of intraorbital optic nerve (ION) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) measured by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI), and the severity of glaucomatous damage.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this cross-sectional study, 41 glaucoma patients and 12 age- and sex-matched controls underwent standard automated perimetry (SAP) and frequency doubling technology (FDT) as functional evaluation; optic disc stereophotograph, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal scanning laser tomography as ocular structural evaluation; and 3T MRI. Structure-structure and structure-function correlation were performed using bootstrap resampling method for clustered data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The ION mean diameter and cross-sectional area were different between glaucoma and control groups at 5mm and 10mm (all, p≤0.011) from the globe, but not at 15mm (both, p≥0.067). LGN height was significantly lower in glaucoma group (p = 0.005). OCT rim area and functional parameters (SAP and FDT) correlated significantly with all ION segments, showing stronger correlations at 10 and 15 mm. ION parameters at 10 and 15 mm presented mild-to-moderate correlation with OCT peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness, and ION at 15mm had mild association with the neuroretinal rim area on stereophotographs. Although LGN height was significantly smaller in glaucoma group (p = 0.005), LGN parameters were not associated with any ocular structural or functional parameter.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Assessment of central and peripheral nervous systems using 3T MRI confirmed that glaucoma patients had smaller ION dimensions and LGN height compared to the control group. In general, ION dimensions presented mild to moderate correlations with functional and ocular structural parameters. Although ION had significant correlations at any distance from the eye, the ION distal locations correlated better with OCT results and functional parameters.

In medicine, diagnoses based on medical test results are probabilistic by nature. Unfortunately, cognitive illusions regarding the statistical meaning of test results are well documented among patients, medical students, and even physicians. There are two effective strategies that can foster insight into what is known as Bayesian reasoning situations: (1) translating the statistical information on the prevalence of a disease and the sensitivity and the false-alarm rate of a specific test for that disease from probabilities into natural frequencies, and (2) illustrating the statistical information with tree diagrams, for instance, or with other pictorial representation. So far, such strategies have only been empirically tested in combination for “1-test cases”, where one binary hypothesis (“disease” vs. “no disease”) has to be diagnosed based on one binary test result (“positive” vs. “negative”). However, in reality, often more than one medical test is conducted to derive a diagnosis. In two studies, we examined a total of 388 medical students from the University of Regensburg (Germany) with medical “2-test scenarios”. Each student had to work on two problems: diagnosing breast cancer with mammography and sonography test results, and diagnosing HIV infection with the ELISA and Western Blot tests. In Study 1 (N = 190 participants), we systematically varied the presentation of statistical information (“only textual information” vs. “only tree diagram” vs. “text and tree diagram in combination”), whereas in Study 2 (N = 198 participants), we varied the kinds of tree diagrams (“complete tree” vs. “highlighted tree” vs. “pruned tree”). All versions were implemented in probability format (including probability trees) and in natural frequency format (including frequency trees). We found that natural frequency trees, especially when the question-related branches were highlighted, improved performance, but that none of the corresponding probabilistic visualizations did.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Karin Binder</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195029</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162689040d7:6443f21:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522172707031</crawled><fingerprint>272c294d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Karin Binder, Stefan Krauss, Georg Bruckmaier, Jörg Marienhagen&lt;/p&gt;

Light causes damage to the retina (phototoxicity) and decreases photoreceptor responses to light. The most harmful component of visible light is the blue wavelength (400–500 nm). Different filters have been tested, but so far all of them allow passing a lot of this wavelength (70%). The aim of this work has been to prove that a filter that removes 94% of the blue component may protect the function and morphology of the retina significantly. Three experimental groups were designed. The first group was unexposed to light, the second one was exposed and the third one was exposed and protected by a blue-blocking filter. Light damage was induced in young albino mice (p30) by exposing them to white light of high intensity (5,000 lux) continuously for 7 days. Short wavelength light filters were used for light protection. The blue component was removed (94%) from the light source by our filter. Electroretinographical recordings were performed before and after light damage. Changes in retinal structure were studied using immunohistochemistry, and TUNEL labeling. Also, cells in the outer nuclear layer were counted and compared among the three different groups. Functional visual responses were significantly more conserved in protected animals (with the blue-blocking filter) than in unprotected animals. Also, retinal structure was better kept and photoreceptor survival was greater in protected animals, these differences were significant in central areas of the retina. Still, functional and morphological responses were significantly lower in protected than in unexposed groups. In conclusion, this blue-blocking filter decreases significantly photoreceptor damage after exposure to high intensity light. Actually, our eyes are exposed for a very long time to high levels of blue light (screens, artificial light LED, neons…). The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Javier Vicente-Tejedor</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194218</canonicalUrl><engagement>44</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e0f:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>43ed651b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Javier Vicente-Tejedor, Miguel Marchena, Laura Ramírez, Diego García-Ayuso, Violeta Gómez-Vicente, Celia Sánchez-Ramos, Pedro de la Villa, Francisco Germain&lt;/p&gt;

The potential damage caused by blue light can be palliated.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Removal of the blue component of light significantly decreases retinal damage after high intensity exposure</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021781?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021781?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5021781?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522735268000</published><author><name>Marco Caricato</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_1629efc14a5:7a6b3a:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523085743269</crawled><fingerprint>4aac2185</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 13, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Linear response coupled cluster theory with the polarizable continuum model within the singles approximation for the solvent response</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01241</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>295</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01241/20180412/images/medium/jm-2017-01241q_0009.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01241</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/xSZ3DPUDTzA/acs.jmedchem.7b01241</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523592000000</published><author><name>Yu Zong, Xiuyun Sun, Hongying Gao, Kirsten J.

Many physical simulations aim at evaluating the net interaction between two rigid bodies, resulting from the cumulative effect of pairwise interactions between their constituents. This is manifested particularly in biomolecular applications such as hierarchical protein folding instances where the interaction between almost rigid domains directly influences the folding pathway, the interaction between macromolecules for drug design purposes, self-assembly of nanoparticles for drug design and drug delivery, and design of smart materials and bio-sensors. In general, the brute force approach requires quadratic (in terms of the number of particles) number of pairwise evaluation operations for any relative pose of the two bodies, unless simplifying assumptions lead to a collapse of the computational complexity. We propose to approximate the pairwise interaction function using a linear predictor function, in which the basis functions have separated forms, i.e. the variables that describe local geometries of the two rigid bodies and the ones that reflect the relative pose between them are split in each basis function. Doing so replaces the quadratic number of interaction evaluations for each relative pose with a one-time quadratic computation of a set of characteristic parameters at a preprocessing step, plus constant number of pose function evaluations at each pose, where this constant is determined by the required accuracy of approximation as well as the efficiency of the used approximation method. We will show that the standard deviation of the error for the net interaction is linearly (in terms of number of particles) proportional to the regression error, if the regression errors are from a normal distribution. Our results show that proper balance of the tradeoff between accuracy and speed-up yields an approximation which is computationally superior to other existing methods while maintaining reasonable precision.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Pouya Tavousi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195618</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529d:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>7fa8e306</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pouya Tavousi&lt;/p&gt;

Social exclusion is a painful experience that is felt as a threat to the human need to belong and can lead to increased aggressive and anti-social behaviours, and results in emotional and cognitive numbness. Excluded individuals also seem to show an automatic tuning to positivity: they tend to increase their selective attention towards social acceptance signals. Despite these effects known in the literature, the consequences of social exclusion on social information processing still need to be explored in depth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social exclusion on processing two features that are strictly bound in the appraisal of the meaning of facial expressions: gaze direction and emotional expression. In two experiments (N = 60, N = 45), participants were asked to identify gaze direction or emotional expressions from facial stimuli, in which both these features were manipulated. They performed these tasks in a four-block crossed design after being socially included or excluded using the Cyberball game. Participants’ empathy and self-reported emotions were recorded using the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and PANAS questionnaires. The Need Threat Scale and three additional questions were also used as manipulation checks in the second experiment. In both experiments, excluded participants showed to be less accurate than included participants in gaze direction discrimination. Modulatory effects of direct gaze (Experiment 1) and sad expression (Experiment 2) on the effects of social exclusion were found on response times (RTs) in the emotion recognition task. Specific differences in the reaction to social exclusion between males and females were also found in Experiment 2: excluded male participants tended to be less accurate and faster than included male participants, while excluded females showed a more accurate and slower performance than included female participants. No influence of social exclusion on PANAS or EQ scores was found. Results are discussed in the context of the importance of identifying gaze direction in appraisal theories.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Francesco Bossi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195100</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ef:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>9cfe13e9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Bossi, Marcello Gallucci, Paola Ricciardelli&lt;/p&gt;

Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type composition for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released: https://github.com/hagenaue/BrainInABlender). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the neuron to glia ratio of the samples. This variability was not simply due to dissection - the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects.

The ecology of Lyme borreliosis is complex in northwestern California, with several potential reservoir hosts, tick vectors, and genospecies of &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu lato. The primary objective of this study was to determine the fine-scale spatial distribution of different genospecies in four rodent species, the California ground squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Otospermophilus beecheyi&lt;/i&gt;), northern flying squirrel (&lt;i&gt;Glaucomys sabrinus&lt;/i&gt;), dusky-footed woodrat (&lt;i&gt;Neotoma fuscipes&lt;/i&gt;), and Allen’s chipmunk (&lt;i&gt;Neotamias senex&lt;/i&gt;). Rodents were live-trapped between June 2004 and May 2005 at the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation (HVTR) in Humboldt County, California. Ear-punch biopsies obtained from each rodent were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analysis. The programs ArcGIS and SaTScan were used to examine the spatial distribution of genospecies. Multinomial log-linear models were used to model habitat and host-specific characteristics and their effect on the presence of each borrelial genospecies. The Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to compare models and determine model fit. &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was primarily associated with chipmunks and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; largely with woodrats. The top model included the variables “host species”, “month”, and “elevation” (weight = 0.84). Spatial clustering of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;bissettiae&lt;/i&gt; was detected in the northwestern section of the HVTR, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt; sensu stricto was clustered in the southeastern section. We conclude that the spatial distribution of these borreliae are driven at least in part by host species, time-of-year, and elevation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Gregory M.

The subterranean niche harbours animals with extreme adaptations. These adaptations decrease the vagility of taxa and, along with other behavioural adaptations, often result in isolated populations characterized by small effective population sizes, high inbreeding, population bottlenecks, genetic drift and consequently, high spatial genetic structure. Although information is available for some species, estimates of genetic diversity and whether this variation is spatially structured, is lacking for the Cape mole-rat (&lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt;). By adopting a range-wide sampling regime and employing two variable mitochondrial markers (cytochrome &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and control region), we report on the effects that life-history, population demography and geographic barriers had in shaping genetic variation and population genetic patterns in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also compare our results to information available for the sister taxon of the study species, &lt;i&gt;Bathyergus suillus&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits low genetic diversity relative to the concomitantly distributed &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suillus&lt;/i&gt;, most likely due to differences in habitat specificity, habitat fragmentation and historical population declines. In addition, the isolated nature of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations and low levels of population connectivity has led to small effective population sizes and genetic differentiation, possibly aided by genetic drift. Not surprisingly therefore, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits pronounced spatial structure across its range in South Africa.

The subterranean niche harbours animals with extreme adaptations. These adaptations decrease the vagility of taxa and, along with other behavioural adaptations, often result in isolated populations characterized by small effective population sizes, high inbreeding, population bottlenecks, genetic drift and consequently, high spatial genetic structure. Although information is available for some species, estimates of genetic diversity and whether this variation is spatially structured, is lacking for the Cape mole-rat (&lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt;). By adopting a range-wide sampling regime and employing two variable mitochondrial markers (cytochrome &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; and control region), we report on the effects that life-history, population demography and geographic barriers had in shaping genetic variation and population genetic patterns in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt;. We also compare our results to information available for the sister taxon of the study species, &lt;i&gt;Bathyergus suillus&lt;/i&gt;. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits low genetic diversity relative to the concomitantly distributed &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;suillus&lt;/i&gt;, most likely due to differences in habitat specificity, habitat fragmentation and historical population declines. In addition, the isolated nature of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations and low levels of population connectivity has led to small effective population sizes and genetic differentiation, possibly aided by genetic drift. Not surprisingly therefore, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibits pronounced spatial structure across its range in South Africa. Along with geographic distance and demography, other factors shaping the genetic structure of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; include the historical and contemporary impacts of mountains, rivers, sea-level fluctuations and elevation. Given the isolation and differentiation among &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capensis&lt;/i&gt; populations, the monotypic genus &lt;i&gt;Georychus&lt;/i&gt; may represent a species complex.</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Spatial genetic diversity in the Cape mole-rat, &amp;lt;i&gt;Georychus capensis&amp;lt;/i&gt;: Extreme isolation of populations in a subterranean environment</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195195</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195195</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195195</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;
Objective &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new more thermostable Flolan (epoprostenol) solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) receiving higher doses of Flolan than those typically administered in Western countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This open-label, single-arm study was conducted in 10 Japanese PAH patients. During the run-in period, patients were intravenously infused with Flolan (45 ng/kg/min or higher doses) solution prepared with the existing pH 10.5 diluent. The patients were then switched to a new more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent and observed for a 4-week treatment period. As a primary endpoint, safety after switching to the new Flolan solution was evaluated. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and the necessity for dose adjustment of Flolan in these patients.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;All 10 patients completed the study period. Observed adverse events were nausea and hepatic function abnormal in 1 patient each, and both events were mild. No patients required dose adjustment due to the change from baseline in mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured 3 hrs after switching to Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated diluent. No major changes from baseline in mPAP, pulmonary vascular resistance, or right atrial pressure were observed at 24 hrs and at 4 weeks after switching to the Flolan solution prepared with pH 12.0 diluent. Although some patients showed increases in cardiac output (CO) from baseline at 24 hrs and 4 weeks, no patients required dose reduction as a result of an increase in CO.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Neither safety/efficacy concerns nor any dose adjustments of Flolan after switching to a more thermostable Flolan solution prepared with the reformulated pH 12.0 diluent could be required in Japanese patients with PAH receiving higher doses of Flolan.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02705807&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Kazuko Mihara</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195195</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7692a:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>9ed8c6a9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazuko Mihara, Aiko Ogawa, Hiromi Matsubara, Takumi Terao, Yoshitaka Ichikawa&lt;/p&gt;

We propose a novel approach to modelling rater effects in scoring-based assessment. The approach is based on a Bayesian hierarchical model and simulations from the posterior distribution. We apply it to large-scale essay assessment data over a period of 5 years. Empirical results suggest that the model provides a good fit for both the total scores and when applied to individual rubrics. We estimate the median impact of rater effects on the final grade to be ± 2 points on a 50 point scale, while 10% of essays would receive a score at least ± 5 different from their actual quality. Most of the impact is due to rater unreliability, not rater bias.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Kaja Zupanc</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195297</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f61:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>b848a373</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kaja Zupanc, Erik Štrumbelj&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to summarize and discuss the similarities and differences in inflammatory biomarkers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic retrieval of literature up to June 2017 in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and the Wanfang database was conducted. Extracted data were analyzed with STATA (version 14). The standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of each indicator were calculated using a random effect model. We also performed tests of heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, assessments of bias, and meta-regression in this meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 54 observational studies were included. By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers. Some of these markers, such as CRP and IL-6, play roles in both POD and POCD, while others are specific to either one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523480400000</updated><author><name>Xuling Liu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195659</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b5daa18b:78d3ca:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523469427083</crawled><fingerprint>626b5664</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuling Liu, Yang Yu, Shengmei Zhu&lt;/p&gt;

By meta-analysis we found significantly increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (9 studies, SMD 0.883, 95% CI 0.130 to 1.637, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 10 studies, SMD -0.133, 95% CI -0.512 to 0.246, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.429 in POCD) and interleukin (IL)-6 (7 studies, SMD 0.386, 95% CI 0.054 to 0.717, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022 in POD; 16 studies, SMD 0.089, 95% CI -0.133 to 0.311, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.433 in POCD) concentrations in both POD and POCD patients. We also found that the SMDs of CRP and IL-6 from POCD patients were positively correlated with surgery type in the meta-regression (CRP: Coefficient = 1.555365, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 10 studies; IL-6: Coefficient = -0.6455521, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.086, 16 studies).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Available evidence from medium-to-high quality observational studies suggests that POD and POCD are indeed correlated with the concentration of peripheral and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers. Some of these markers, such as CRP and IL-6, play roles in both POD and POCD, while others are specific to either one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1523480400000</published><title>Inflammatory markers in postoperative delirium (POD) and cognitive dysfunction (POCD): A meta-analysis of observational studies</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3116.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3116.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/E3116.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Certain viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages) enzymatically hypermodify their DNA to protect their genetic material from host restriction endonuclease-mediated cleavage.

Our objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics for treatment of bacterial infections in adults and children in secondary care settings, using the evidence from published systematic reviews. We conducted electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Cinahl. Our primary outcome was clinical resolution. The quality of included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE criteria. We included 6 systematic reviews (n = 3,162). Four reviews were rated high quality, and two of moderate quality. In adults, there was no difference between shorter versus longer duration in clinical resolution rates for peritonitis (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.08, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 24%), or acute pyelonephritis and septic UTI (clinical failure: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.46 to 2.18). The quality of the evidence was very low to moderate. In children, there was no difference in clinical resolution rates for pneumonia (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 48%), pyelonephritis (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.04) and confirmed bacterial meningitis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.11, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate. In conclusion, there is currently a limited body of evidence to clearly assess the clinical benefits of shorter versus longer duration antibiotics in secondary care. High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Igho J.

High quality trials assessing strategies to shorten antibiotic treatment duration for bacterial infections in secondary care settings should now be a priority.</description><published>1522270800000</published><title>Overview of systematic reviews assessing the evidence for shorter versus longer duration antibiotic treatment for bacterial infections in secondary care</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03799-4</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03799-4</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/l3qKsCV8lmA/s41467-018-03799-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&amp;lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &amp;lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03799-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03799-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/l3qKsCV8lmA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Manon Bonneau</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03799-4</link><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_162b40a1deb:44bdb1:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523438984683</crawled><fingerprint>23c5615d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: &amp;lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&amp;lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &amp;lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&amp;lt;/i&gt;, Published online: 11 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03799-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03799-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: &lt;i&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/i&gt; crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/l3qKsCV8lmA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1523430000000</published><title>Author Correction: Culex pipiens crossing type diversity is governed by an amplified and polymorphic operon of Wolbachia</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0193742</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0193742</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193742</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tuyen Van Duong, Te-Chih Wong, Hsi-Hsien Chen, Tzen-Wen Chen, Tso-Hsiao Chen, Yung-Ho Hsu, Sheng-Jeng Peng, Ko-Lin Kuo, Chi-Sin Wang, I-Hsin Tseng, Yi-Wei Feng, Tai-Yue Chang, Chien-Tien Su, Shwu-Huey Yang&lt;/p&gt;
Dietary energy intake strongly linked to dialysis outcomes. We aimed to explore the optimal cut-off point of energy intake (EI) for identification of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in hemodialysis patients. The cross-sectional data of 243 hemodialysis patients from multi-dialysis centers in Taiwan was used. The dietary intake was assessed by using the three-day dietary questionnaire, and a 24-hour dietary recall, clinical and biochemical data were also evaluated. The MetS was diagnosed by the Harmonized Metabolic Syndrome criteria. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was to depict the optimal cut-off value of EI for the diagnosis of MetS. The logistic regression was also used to explore the association between inadequate EI and MetS. The optimal cut-off points of EI for identifying the MetS were 26.7 kcal/kg/day for patients aged less than 60 years, or with non-diabetes, and 26.2 kcal/kg/day for patients aged 60 years and above, or with diabetes, respectively. The likelihood of the MetS increased with lower percentiles of energy intake in hemodialysis patients. In the multivariate analysis, the inadequate dietary energy intake strongly determined 3.24 folds of the MetS. The assessment of dietary EI can help healthcare providers detecting patients who are at risk of metabolic syndrome.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Tuyen Van Duong</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193742</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9f0:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>affd058a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tuyen Van Duong, Te-Chih Wong, Hsi-Hsien Chen, Tzen-Wen Chen, Tso-Hsiao Chen, Yung-Ho Hsu, Sheng-Jeng Peng, Ko-Lin Kuo, Chi-Sin Wang, I-Hsin Tseng, Yi-Wei Feng, Tai-Yue Chang, Chien-Tien Su, Shwu-Huey Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Cochrane reviewers are strongly encouraged to evaluate the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes by using the GRADE approach and to report these results in a Summary of Findings (SoF) table. We aimed to assess whether outcomes reported in the SoF table of Cochrane reviews could be considered patient-important outcomes (PIOs) and the quality of the available evidence for these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We performed a methodological review of Cochrane reviews published between March 2011 and September 2014. For a random sample of Cochrane reviews reporting a SoF table, we extracted all outcomes reported in this table and evaluated whether they could be considered PIOs (i.e., mortality, other clinical events, adverse events, function, pain, quality of life and therapeutic decisions). Then, we collected the quality of evidence for every outcome in these SoF tables.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We included 290 reviews issued by 47 of the 53 Cochrane Review Groups. Every SoF table included a median of 5 outcomes, for a total of 1414 outcomes; 1089 (77%) could be considered PIOs. Almost all reviews (n = 278, 96%) included at least one PIO in their SoF table. The quality of evidence for the outcomes was high for 12% (n = 168), moderate for 28% (n = 402) and low or very low for 45% (n = 640). Less than one quarter of reviews (n = 63) included at least one PIO with high-quality evidence that favoured a benefit of the experimental intervention evaluated in half of them (n = 34 reviews).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Many outcomes reported in the SoF table of recent Cochrane reviews can be considered PIOs.

Patient-nominated supporters can potentially improve the continuum of HIV care. We retrospectively determined factors associated with having a patient-nominated supporter among people living with HIV (PLWH), and its association with retention in care and viral suppression. We analysed registries of adults evaluated by social workers (n = 1345) at a referral hospital in Peru between 2011–2014. Nondisclosure of HIV status was associated with lacking supporters (aPR: 5.41, 95% CI: 3.83–7.64). Retention in care was 76.4% and 34.2% after one and two years of enrolment, respectively. PLWH with supporters were more likely to be retained in care after two years (aRR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02–1.81), but not after one year (aRR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.98–1.23) compared to PLWH without supporters. Having supporters who were parents or friends was associated with an increased probability of being retained in care after one and two years of enrolment. Viral suppression after one year of enrolment was 58.7%. Having a supporter was not associated with viral suppression (aRR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.41), but PLWH with supporters were more likely to have viral load measurements (p = 0.005). Patient-nominated supporters appear beneficial for engagement in HIV care; these benefits may be related to the nature of their relationship with PLWH.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Mateo Prochazka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195389</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d575ff:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>9c6e7c3d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mateo Prochazka, Larissa Otero, Kelika A.

These types of responses have been attributed to cell-intrinsic stochastic processes and variable abundances of biochemical constituents, such as proteins, but the influence of organelles has yet to be determined. We use the response to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a new statistical framework for determining parameter influence on cell-to-cell variability through the inference of variance explained, DEPICTIVE, to demonstrate that variable mitochondria abundance correlates with cell survival and determines the fractional cell death response.

These types of responses have been attributed to cell-intrinsic stochastic processes and variable abundances of biochemical constituents, such as proteins, but the influence of organelles has yet to be determined. We use the response to TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and a new statistical framework for determining parameter influence on cell-to-cell variability through the inference of variance explained, DEPICTIVE, to demonstrate that variable mitochondria abundance correlates with cell survival and determines the fractional cell death response. By quantitative data analysis and modeling we attribute this effect to variable effective concentrations at the mitochondria surface of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Further, we demonstrate that inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, used in cancer treatment, may increase the diversity of cellular responses, enhancing resistance to treatment.</description><published>1523343600000</published><title>Origins of fractional control in regulated cell death [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/JikLWKYF1dU/s41598-018-22721-y</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&amp;amp;gt;A mutation, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22721-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JikLWKYF1dU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Naoki Yahata</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1621ea75a37:2c77d9:34f43e70</id><crawled>1520932706871</crawled><fingerprint>8824b2dd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&amp;amp;gt;A mutation, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22721-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-22721-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/JikLWKYF1dU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1520924400000</published><title>Author Correction: TALEN-mediated shift of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in MELAS-iPSCs with m.13513 G&gt;A mutation</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194861</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Insley, Shai Shaham&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Retention, defined as continuous engagement in care, is an important indicator for quality of healthcare services. To achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, emphasis on retention as a predictor of viral suppression in patients initiated on ART is vital. Using routinely collected clinical data, the authors sought to determine the effect of age on retention post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;De-identified electronic data for 32965 HIV-infected persons aged ≥15 years at enrolment into the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program between January 2008 and December 2014 were analyzed. Follow-up time was defined from the date of ART initiation until either loss to follow-up or death or close of the database (September 2016) was observed. Proportions were compared using Pearson’s Chi-square test and medians using Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression model was used to assess differences in ART initiation between groups, adjusting for baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for baseline characteristics and antiretroviral therapy (ART) status was used to compute hazard ratios. Kaplan-Meier survival function was used to compare retention on ART at 12, 24, and 36 months post ART initiation.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the total sample, 3924 (12.0%) were aged ≥50 years at enrolment. The median (IQR) age of young adults and older adults were 32.5 (26.6, 36.9) and 54.9 (51.7, 59.9) respectively. ART initiation rates were 70.5% among older adults and 68.2% among younger adults. Retention rates in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation were 73.9% (95% CL: 72.2, 75.5), 62.9% (95% CL: 61.0, 64.7) and 55.4% (95% CL: 53.5, 57.3) among older adults compared to 69.8% (95% CL: 69.1, 70.4), 58.1% (95% CL: 57.4, 58.8) and 49.3% (95% CL: 48.6, 50.0) among younger adults (p &amp;lt;0.001). A higher proportion of older adults were retained in HIV care post ART initiation compared to younger adults, Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) though they were more likely to die, AHR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A higher proportion of older adults are initiated on ART and have better retention in care at 12, 24 and 36 months post ART initiation than younger adults. However, older adults have a higher all-cause mortality rate, perhaps partially driven by late presentation to care.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products contain various amounts of dimeric IgG complexes.

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allylmercapto-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (ASSNAC) was shown in our previous study to activate Nrf2-mediated processes and increase glutathione level and resistance to oxidative stress in cultured endothelial cells. In this study, we explored the antioxidant protective effect of ASSNAC in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans (C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans)&lt;/i&gt;. Treatment of &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter strain (CL2166) with increasing concentrations of ASSNAC (0.2 to 20 mM) for 24 hours and with ASSNAC (10 mM) for various time periods demonstrated a significant concentration- and time-dependent increase in Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression (up to 60-fold at 20 mM after 24 hours). In addition, ASSNAC (2 mM; 24 hours) treatment of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; strains N2 (wild type strain), &lt;i&gt;gst-4&lt;/i&gt; reporter (CL2166) and temperature sensitive sterile strain (CF512) significantly increased GST enzyme activity by 1.9-, 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively. ASSNAC (2.0 mM; 24 hours) increased the reduced glutathione content in N2 and CF512 strains by 5.9- and 4.9-fold, respectively. Exposure of &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; (N2 strain) to a lethal concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.5 mM; 120 min) resulted in death of 88% of the nematodes while pretreatment with ASSNAC (24 hours) reduced nematodes death in a concentration-dependent manner down to 8% at 2.0 mM. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes (strain CF512) cultured on agar plates containing ASSNAC (0.5 to 5.0 mM) demonstrated a significant increase in lifespan compared to control (mean lifespan 26.45 ± 0.64 versus 22.90 ± 0.59 days; log-rank p ≤ 0.001 at 2.0 mM) with a maximal lifespan of 40 versus 36 days. In conclusion, ASSNAC up-regulates the GST gene expression and enzyme activity as well as the glutathione content in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes and thereby increases their resistance to oxidative stress and extends their lifespan.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Naphtali Savion</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194780</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f9:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>4b507ec5</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Naphtali Savion, Amir Levine, Shlomo Kotev-Emeth, Ulrike Bening Abu-Shach, Limor Broday&lt;/p&gt;

Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells.

Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, EC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. These results further support the importance of developing standard operating procedures for generating reliable and reproducible &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data sets for potential antivirals.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Testing therapeutics in cell-based assays: Factors that influence the apparent potency of drugs</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03525-0</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03525-0</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/g0x7sval-Gs/s41467-018-03525-0</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interruption of lactate uptake by inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate transport unravels direct antitumor and radiosensitizing effects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interruption of lactate uptake by inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate transport unravels direct antitumor and radiosensitizing effects, Published online: 23 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03525-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03525-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Tumor cells can fuel their metabolism with lactate.

Wind has a significant effect on the control of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), resulting in changes in their ground speed and direction, which has an important influence on the results of integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning. The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>He Luo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194690</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16249a76720:38087f2:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521654130464</crawled><fingerprint>5e6e4f2a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Luo, Zhengzheng Liang, Moning Zhu, Xiaoxuan Hu, Guoqiang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely performed to identify brain lesions in boys with central precocious puberty (CPP). We investigated the prevalence of CPP in Korean boys and the necessity for routine brain MRI examinations. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2003 to December 2016 at a Korean university hospital. Among 151 boys who were diagnosed with CPP, the data of 138 boys who underwent sellar MRI were evaluated. The mean age of the study subjects was 9.51 ± 0.56 years (&amp;lt;8 years [n = 4] and ≥8 years [n = 134]). We excluded patients who had been previously diagnosed with brain tumors and those who did not undergo a sellar MRI because of refusal or the decision of the pediatric endocrinologist. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of intracranial lesions among boys with CPP. Normal sellar MRI findings were observed in 128 of the 138 boys (93%). Mild brain abnormalities were found in 10 boys (7%), while none of the patients had pathological brain lesions. The prevalence (7%) of intracranial lesions among boys who were healthy, did not have neurological symptoms, and were diagnosed with CPP was different from that previously reported. None of the identified lesions necessitated treatment. Although this was a single country study, we found that the previously reported prevalence of brain lesions in boys with CPP is much higher than the prevalence observed in Korea. This study suggests the need to globally reevaluate the prevalence of pathological brain lesions among male pediatric patients with CPP.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Jong Seo Yoon</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195209</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f5b:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>8f45462f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Seo Yoon, Cheol Hwan So, Hae Sang Lee, Jung Sub Lim, Jin Soon Hwang&lt;/p&gt;

Microbiome science is revealing that the phenotype and health of animals, including humans, depend on the sustained function of their resident microorganisms.

In recent years, entrepreneurship has been gaining more prominence as a potential tool for solving poverty in developing countries. This paper mainly examines the relationship between farmer entrepreneurship and rural poverty alleviation in China by assessing the contribution of farm entrepreneurs towards overcoming poverty. Data were collected from 309 employees of farmer entrepreneurships in Guangxi Province through survey questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct an analysis of the effects of three identified capabilities of farm entrepreneurs—economic, educational and knowledge, and socio-cultural capabilities—on attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth and the qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship and how these in turn affect rural poverty, using AMOS 21. The findings show that socio-cultural capability has the greatest influence on farmer entrepreneurship growth (β = 0.50, p&amp;lt;0.001). The qualitative growth of farmer entrepreneurship also more significantly impacts rural poverty (β = 0.69, p&amp;lt;0.001) than attitude towards farmer entrepreneurship growth. This study suggests that policy makers in China should involve more rural farmers in the targeted poverty alleviation strategies of the government by equipping rural farmers with entrepreneurial skills. This can serve as a sustainable, bottom-up approach to alleviating rural poverty in remote areas of the country. The study also extends the literature on the farmer entrepreneurship-rural poverty alleviation nexus in China, and this can serve as a lesson for other developing countries in the fight against rural poverty.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Eric Yaw Naminse</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194912</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef08:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>fb35b522</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Yaw Naminse, Jincai Zhuang&lt;/p&gt;

Increasingly, ecoimmunology studies aim to use relevant pathogen exposure to examine the impacts of infection on physiological processes in wild animals. Alphaviruses are arthropod-borne, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (“arboviruses”) responsible for millions of cases of human illnesses each year. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is a unique alphavirus that is transmitted by a cimicid insect, the swallow bug, and is amplified in two avian species: the house sparrow (&lt;i&gt;Passer domesticus&lt;/i&gt;) and the cliff swallow (&lt;i&gt;Petrochelidon pyrrhonota)&lt;/i&gt;. BCRV, like many alphaviruses, exhibits age-dependent susceptibility where the young are most susceptible to developing disease and exhibit a high mortality rate. However, alphavirus disease etiology in nestling birds is unknown. In this study, we infected nestling house sparrows with Buggy Creek virus and measured virological, pathological, growth, and digestive parameters following infection. Buggy Creek virus caused severe encephalitis in all infected nestlings, and the peak viral concentration in brain tissue was over 34 times greater than any other tissue. Growth, tissue development, and digestive function were all significantly impaired during BCRV infection. However, based on histopathological analysis performed, this impairment does not appear to be the result of direct tissue damage by the virus, but likely caused by encephalitis and neuronal invasion and impairment of the central nervous system. This is the first study to examine the course of alphavirus diseases in nestling birds and these results will improve our understanding of age-dependent infections of alphaviruses in vertebrate hosts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Carol A.

Concentrations of 11 salivary cytokines (IFN-γ, IFN-α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL12&lt;sub&gt;p70&lt;/sub&gt;, TNF-α, IFN-λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, IL-22) were determined. Cytokine levels were compared between healthy controls acute infection and convalescence. The correlation between clinical data and salivary cytokine profile in infected children was assessed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The salivary cytokine profile changes significantly in response to acute RV infection. In RV-infected patients, IL-22 levels were increased in the acute phase with respect to convalescence (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-value &amp;lt; 0.001).

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become an important issue in the healthcare systems of both developed and developing countries. Phytoestrogens have shown estrogenic effects, which may involve in the etiology of MetS. The current study consisted of 293 MetS cases and 264 healthy controls. The concentrations of seven plasma phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, enterolactone, enterodiol and coumestrol) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and risks of MetS, as well as the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and MetS components. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between equol concentration in equol-producers and MetS components. Higher concentrations of total isoflavone and equol were associated with decreased risk of MetS.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become an important issue in the healthcare systems of both developed and developing countries. Phytoestrogens have shown estrogenic effects, which may involve in the etiology of MetS. The current study consisted of 293 MetS cases and 264 healthy controls. The concentrations of seven plasma phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, enterolactone, enterodiol and coumestrol) were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Adjusted unconditional logistic regression was used to assess the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and risks of MetS, as well as the associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and MetS components. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between equol concentration in equol-producers and MetS components. Higher concentrations of total isoflavone and equol were associated with decreased risk of MetS. The equol concentration was negatively associated with waist circumference and positively associated with HDL-C level. Increased daidzein was associated with both lower waist circumference and lower fasting blood glucose levels. Our results suggested that higher plasma total isoflavone, equol and daidzein might decrease MetS risk.</description><published>1521579600000</published><title>The associations between plasma phytoestrogens concentration and metabolic syndrome risks in Chinese population</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1318?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1318?rss=1</link><crawled>1521742399447</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521740378000</published><author><name>Dengler, R.</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6382/1318.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>83</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1624eea47d7:4150413:9f3b30f2</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/359/6382/1318?rss=1</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>50259dc1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Medicine, Diseases, Molecular Biology</item></keywords><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Protein may explain morning sickness, and worse</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03848-4</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03848-4</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03848-4</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pioneering Alzheimer’s study in Colombia zeroes in on enigmatic protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pioneering Alzheimer’s study in Colombia zeroes in on enigmatic protein, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03848-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03848-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Researchers tracking a genetic mutation that causes an early-onset form of the disease hope to uncover new drug targets.</content></content><published>1522134000000</published><author><name>Sara Reardon</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>210</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16267b6efee:62b2ff1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522158465006</crawled><fingerprint>8ab0e09e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pioneering Alzheimer’s study in Colombia zeroes in on enigmatic protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pioneering Alzheimer’s study in Colombia zeroes in on enigmatic protein, Published online: 27 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03848-4&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03848-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Researchers tracking a genetic mutation that causes an early-onset form of the disease hope to uncover new drug targets.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03848-4/d41586-018-03848-4_15566532.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Pioneering Alzheimer’s study in Colombia zeroes in on enigmatic protein</title></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-h?rss=1</originId><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-h?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6385/166-h?rss=1</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1523554636000</published><author><name>Benson, P.

Moreover, a set of novel gene interaction predictions are validated by up-to-date literature-based database entries.</description><published>1523602800000</published><title>GNE: A deep learning framework for gene network inference by aggregating biological information [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4117</originId><published>1522911600000</published><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4117</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4117</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Highlights, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4117&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4117&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Research Highlights</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_16296980fd7:a466565:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522944970711</crawled><fingerprint>fd254a7b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Biotechnology</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Research Highlights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research Highlights, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4117&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4117&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Research Highlights</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Research Highlights</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>238</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060/20180402/images/medium/mp-2018-00060k_0007.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/D_KiS3nbVoQ/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522728000000</published><author><name>Rafael Barbas, Cristina Puigjaner, Rafel Prohens</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060</link><id>hkv7tkf6rNovbaIxikRBMOPZEsTuri716fXYbY8OcAk=_1628b79b9a9:2956a6:76251cdd</id><crawled>1522758433193</crawled><fingerprint>4a94bec0</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060/20180402/images/medium/mp-2018-00060k_0007.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00060&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

There is a suspected but unproven association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mental health. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and subjective stress, depressive disorders, health-related quality of life (QoL) and suicide. We selected 124,205 adults from the Korean Community Health Survey in 2013 who were at least 19 years old and who had lived in their current domiciles for &gt; five years. Based on the computer-assisted personal interviews to measure subjective stress in daily life, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, depression diagnosis by a doctor, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts, we evaluated the risk of mental disorders using multiple logistic regression analysis according to the quartiles of air pollutants, such as particulate matter &amp;lt;10μm (PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, using yearly average concentration between August 2012 and July 2013. The prevalence of high stress, poor QoL, depressiveness, diagnosis of depression, and suicide ideation was positively associated with high concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and CO after adjusting for confounding factors. Men were at increased risk of stress, poor QoL, and depressiveness from air pollution exposure than were women. The risk of higher stress or poor QoL in subjects &amp;lt; age 65 increased with air pollution more than did that in subjects ≥ age 65. Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution may be an independent risk factor for mental health disorders ranging from subjective stress to suicide ideation.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Jinyoung Shin</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195607</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171529c:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>ee5a65b4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyoung Shin, Jin Young Park, Jaekyung Choi&lt;/p&gt;

The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Kaitlyn M.

Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote breast cancer motility by suppressing mammalian Diaphanous-related formin-2 (mDia2)</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23476-2</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23476-2</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/nZnwH361EmQ/s41598-018-23476-2</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23476-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23476-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/nZnwH361EmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>Makoto Naruse</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23476-2</link><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16294af12fc:a2b62ab:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522912924412</crawled><fingerprint>1a70a24c</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos, Published online: 05 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23476-2&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23476-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/nZnwH361EmQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><published>1522911600000</published><title>Author Correction: Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos</title></item><item><originId>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaap8793?rss=1</originId><link>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaap8793?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://stm.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/10/433/eaap8793?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;We report the detection of endometrial and ovarian cancers based on genetic analyses of DNA recovered from the fluids obtained during a routine Papanicolaou (Pap) test. The new test, called PapSEEK, incorporates assays for mutations in 18 genes as well as an assay for aneuploidy. In Pap brush samples from 382 endometrial cancer patients, 81% [95% confidence interval (CI), 77 to 85%] were positive, including 78% of patients with early-stage disease. The sensitivity in 245 ovarian cancer patients was 33% (95% CI, 27 to 39%), including 34% of patients with early-stage disease. In contrast, only 1.4% of 714 women without cancer had positive Pap brush samples (specificity, ~99%). Next, we showed that intrauterine sampling with a Tao brush increased the detection of malignancy over endocervical sampling with a Pap brush: 93% of 123 (95% CI, 87 to 97%) patients with endometrial cancer and 45% of 51 (95% CI, 31 to 60%) patients with ovarian cancer were positive, whereas none of the samples from 125 women without cancer were positive (specificity, 100%). Finally, in 83 ovarian cancer patients in whom plasma was available, circulating tumor DNA was found in 43% of patients (95% CI, 33 to 55%). When plasma and Pap brush samples were both tested, the sensitivity for ovarian cancer increased to 63% (95% CI, 51 to 73%). These results demonstrate the potential of mutation-based diagnostics to detect gynecologic cancers at a stage when they are more likely to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Wang, Y., Li, L., Douville, C., Cohen, J.

Notwithstanding newly discovered fold conservation between triplex proteins and bacteriophage protein gpD and the previously recognized bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like fold in VP5, HSV-1 capsid proteins exhibit extraordinary diversity in forms of domain insertion and conformational polymorphism, not only for interactions with tegument proteins but also for encapsulation of large genomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522950073000</published><title>Structure of the herpes simplex virus 1 capsid with associated tegument protein complexes</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0125-1</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0125-1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0125-1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0125-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0125-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain</content></content><published>1521097200000</published><author><name>Yi Zheng</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_162291fca48:97e298:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521108372040</crawled><fingerprint>85d05c8a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain, Published online: 15 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0125-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0125-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><title>Author Correction: CRISPR interference-based specific and efficient gene inactivation in the brain</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195009</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195009</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195009</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas J.

Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in sheep and an example of a disease that may be controlled through breeding for disease resistance. Member states of the European Union have introduced strategies for breeding against scrapie based on the selection of genetically resistant breeding rams. An ambitious strategy adopted in The Netherlands consisted of selecting resistant rams for breeding throughout both breeding and production sectors. Mathematical modelling of the effect of a breeding program on the spreading capacity of scrapie in a national flock is needed for making assessments on how long a breeding strategy needs to be maintained to achieve disease control. Here we describe such a model applied to the Dutch situation, with the use of data on the genetic content of the Dutch sheep population as well as on scrapie occurrence in this population. We show that the time needed for obtaining scrapie control depends crucially on two parameters measuring sheep population structure: the between-flock heterogeneity in genotype frequencies, and the heterogeneity of mixing (contact rates) between sheep flocks. Estimating the first parameter from Dutch genetic survey data and assuming scenario values for the second one, enables model prediction of the time needed to achieve scrapie control in The Netherlands.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522184400000</updated><author><name>Thomas J.

Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8BI0l7B3nAc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985</href></item></canonical><engagement>6</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1623036aae5:5976dd:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1521227311845</crawled><fingerprint>7ce5bfc3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuval B.

Regeneration of endocrine cells is of therapeutic interest and recent studies are promising, but mechanisms of endocrine cell fate acquisition need to be better characterised. The NOTCH pathway is important during pituitary development. Here, we further characterise its role in the murine pituitary, revealing differential sensitivity within and between lineages. In progenitors, NOTCH activation blocks cell fate acquisition, with time-dependant modulation. In differentiating cells, response to activation is blunted in the POU1F1 lineage, with apparently normal cell fate specification, while POMC cells remain sensitive. Absence of apparent defects in &lt;i&gt;Pou1f1-Cre; Rbpj&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice further suggests no direct role for NOTCH signalling in POU1F1 cell fate acquisition. In contrast, in the POMC lineage, NICD expression induces a regression towards a progenitor-like state, suggesting that the NOTCH pathway specifically blocks POMC cell differentiation. These results have implications for pituitary development, plasticity and regeneration.</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The pituitary is an essential endocrine gland regulating multiple processes. Regeneration of endocrine cells is of therapeutic interest and recent studies are promising, but mechanisms of endocrine cell fate acquisition need to be better characterised. The NOTCH pathway is important during pituitary development. Here, we further characterise its role in the murine pituitary, revealing differential sensitivity within and between lineages. In progenitors, NOTCH activation blocks cell fate acquisition, with time-dependant modulation. In differentiating cells, response to activation is blunted in the POU1F1 lineage, with apparently normal cell fate specification, while POMC cells remain sensitive.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) consist of a population of self-renewing cells displaying extensive phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. Research towards the understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity among ESCs is still in its initial stage. Key issues, such as how to identify cell-subset specifically methylated loci and how to interpret the biological meanings of methylation variations remain largely unexplored. To fill in the research gap, we implemented a computational pipeline to analyze single-cell methylome and to perform an integrative analysis with single-cell transcriptome data. According to the origins of variation in DNA methylation, we determined the genomic loci associated with allelic-specific methylation or asymmetric DNA methylation, and explored a beta mixture model to infer the genomic loci exhibiting cell-subset specific methylation (CSM). We observed that the putative CSM loci in ESCs are significantly enriched in CpG island (CGI) shelves and regions with histone marks for promoter and enhancer, and the genes hosting putative CSM loci show wide-ranging expression among ESCs. More interestingly, the putative CSM loci may be clustered into co-methylated modules enriching the binding motifs of distinct sets of transcription factors. Taken together, our study provided a novel tool to explore single-cell methylome and transcriptome to reveal the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks associated with epigenetic heterogeneity of ESCs.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7Po2bpx1o8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006034</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006034</link><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16249acad20:40279:a077e55f</id><crawled>1521654476064</crawled><fingerprint>93f4e9e9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanting Luo, Jianlin He, Xiguang Xu, Ming-an Sun, Xiaowei Wu, Xuemei Lu, Hehuang Xie&lt;/p&gt;

The goal of this study was to objectively assess the effect of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derivate in English bulldogs with stifle degenerative joint disease secondary to cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CCLR). We used a force platform and affixed electrogoniometers to measure peak vertical force (PVF), vertical impulse (VI), stance time (ST), and angular range of motion (AROM), from 12 lame client-owned English bulldogs with post-CCLR stifle joint abnormalities. The 12 affected subjects were treated with 4 intra-articular injections of PRP, at 30-day intervals. Ten untreated, sound English bulldogs were used as a reference group. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using a linear mixed effects model. Mean values of PVF, VI, ST, and AROM were improved within the first 3 months post-treatment in the CCLR group, with mean measured changes increasing to maximum 4.56% body weight gain, 1.5% body weight/second, 0.07 seconds, and 6.18 degrees, respectively. The effects declined progressively after the treatment interval, ending at nearly initial levels after 6 months. This study demonstrates that dogs with CCLR treated with intra-articular PRP had improved PVF, VI, ST, and AROM over time; the duration of effect was waning by the end of the post-treatment period.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>José M.

I have a Nature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03774-5&quot;&gt;“New and Views” comment&lt;/a&gt; on this one (&lt;a href=&quot;http://rdcu.be/KcUV&quot;&gt;free access link&lt;/a&gt;) for a broader audience, but I’ll expand on my thoughts here. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I’m also going on about this on a Nature podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acast.com/nature/29march2018-aiinchemistry-andliquiddropletsinlivingcells-?autoplay=true&amp;seek=49.873266&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the same general thoughts apply to this work as to the last one. What we have, via a team from Münster/BenevolentAI/Shanghai, is another piece of software that has picked up large numbers of possible synthetic transformations and has ways of (1) stringing them together into possible routes and (2) evaluating these against each other to elevate the ones that are deemed more desirable. Naturally, the response from many organic chemists to these things has been “But that’s what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do”, followed by “Surely no program could do it as well”. The strong form of that latter objection is “Surely no program can do this to any useful extent at all”, and the weak form is “Surely no program can do it for all the molecules that we can”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to dispose of the strong-form objection immediately. Whatever you think of the idea, the programs in the last paper and this one (I’m getting to it!) are generating plausible synthetic routes. You may find them derivative of known ones; you may object that they’re not really any different than something that any competent chemist could have done. &lt;em&gt;But those are already victories for the software.&lt;/em&gt; You might also object, with varying degrees of justification, that the molecules and syntheses chosen are there to show the software in the best light, and that real-world use won’t be as fruitful. But that’s a holding action, even should it have merit: the fact that it can work at all turns the problem, if there is one, into optimizing something that already exists. As the history of chess- and Go-playing software shows, such piecing-together-strategies-and-evaluating-them tasks improve relentlessly once they’ve been shown to work in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That takes us well on the way to disposing of the medium objection, because if the programs aren’t doing this as well as a person can now, well, they will. And that also is an introduction into this new paper. You will have heard over the last two or three years about how Google’s (DeepMind’s) AlphaGo program was able to compete with and them beat the best human players of the game. Go is significantly harder to deal with computationally than chess, so this was a real achievement, and it was done partly by building in every human maneuver and strategy known. But last fall, they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero&quot;&gt;AlphaGo Zero&lt;/a&gt;, that comes at the problem more generally. Instead of having strategies wired into it, the new program is capable of inferring strategies on its own. The software ran hours and hours of Go games and figured out good moves by watching what seemed to work out and what didn’t in various situations, and at the end of the process it beat the latest version of AlphaGo, the one that beats every human on the planet, &lt;em&gt;one hundred games in a row&lt;/em&gt;. It makes moves that no one has yet seen in human play, for reasons that Go experts are now trying to work out. (Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815&quot;&gt;latest iteration&lt;/a&gt;, as far as I know).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chematica software I wrote about earlier this month is an example of the AlphaGo style: its makers have spent a great deal of time entering the details of literature reactions into it: this goes to that, but only if there’s not a group like X, and only if the pH doesn’t get a low as Y, etc. Synthetic organic chemists will be familiar with the reactivity tables in the back of the Greene protecting group book – that’s just the sort of thing that was filled out, over and over, and with even more detail. Without this curation, software of this kind tends to generate routes that have obvious “That’s not gonna work” steps in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new paper, though, appears to be in the AlphaGo Zero mode: the program digs through the Reaxys database (all of it) and infers synthetic transformation rules for itself. If this works, it could be a significant advance, because that data curation and entry is a major pain. There are at least two levels to such curation: the first (as mentioned) is capturing all the finer details of what is likely to work (or fail) in the presence of something else. The second goes to the reliability of the synthetic literature in general – you don’t want to feed reactions into the system that haven’t been (or can’t be!) reproduced by others. The way this new program deals with these is pretty straightforward: the first type of curation is handled by brute force processing of Reaxys examples, and the second by a requirement that only transformations that appear independently a certain number of times in the database are allowed into the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic synthesis is a lot harder to reduce to game-type evaluation than chess is, as the authors rightly point out. To get around this, the program combines neural-network processing with a Monte Carlo tree search technique:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this work, we combine three different neural networks together with MCTS to perform chemical synthesis planning (3N-MCTS). The first neural network (the expansion policy) guides the search in promising directions by proposing a restricted number of automatically extracted transformations. A second neural network then predicts whether the proposed reactions are actually feasible (in scope). Finally, to estimate the position value, transformations are sampled from a third neural network during the rollout phase. The neural networks were trained on essentially all reactions published in the history of organic chemistry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the Chematica paper is that the routes were put to a real-world test at the bench. This new work didn’t go that far, but what the authors did do was have the program generate retrosyntheses for already-synthesized molecules, and then have these routes and the known ones evaluated blind by experienced chemists. The results were a toss-up: the machine routes were considered just as plausible or desirable as the human ones, and that (as above) is a victory for the machine. &lt;em&gt;AI wins ties&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;285&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-285x300.jpeg 285w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-768x807.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-974x1024.jpeg 974w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route-300x315.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route.jpeg 1136w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13412&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At right is an example of a route generated by the 3N-MCTS technique. That’s not a particularly hard molecule to make, but it’s not an artificially easy one, either. That is, in fact, an intermediate in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asianjournalofchemistry.co.in/user/journal/viewarticle.aspx?ArticleID=27_6_39&quot;&gt;published synthesis&lt;/a&gt; of potential 5-HT6 ligands, and the route the program found is identical to the one in the paper, so you can be reasonably sure that it’s valid. You or I would probably come up with something similar – I personally didn’t know that first spirocyclobutane step, but I would have done what the program basically did: look in Reaxys or CAS to see if something like that had been prepared. (Note that the program doesn’t memorize routes, just steps – it pieced this together on its own and declared it good). Note that the program delivered this one in 5.4 seconds, and none of us are going to beat that. Add up the total time we all spend on stuff like this and it starts to look like it’s cutting into other work, you know? If you’d like to see several hundred more schemes along those lines, they’re in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978#s1&quot;&gt;the paper’s SI files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have two types of retrosynthesis software that (at least in some realistic examples) are if not better than humans, apparently no worse. Where does that put us? And by “us”, I mean “us synthetic chemists”. My conclusions from the earlier paper stand: we are going to have to get used to this, because if the software is not coming to take retrosynthetic planning away from us now, it will do so shortly. You may not care for that – at times, I may not care for it, either – but &lt;em&gt;it doesn’t matter what we think&lt;/em&gt;. If it can do even a decent job of stitching together and evaluating routes, the software will beat us on just general grasp of the literature alone, which some time ago passed beyond the ability of human brains to organize and remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the next step is more-than-decent ability to see and rate synthetic plans. Despite my comparison to AlphaGo Zero (which is valid on mechanistic grounds), it’s not that this new software is coming up with routes that no human would be able to. But if we’re approaching “good as a human”, the next step is always “even better than a human”. Eventually – and not that long from now – such programs are going to go on to generate “Hey, why didn’t I think of that” routes, but you know what? Those of us in the field now are going to be the only ones saying that. The next generation of chemists won’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will have outsourced synthetic planning to the machines. Retrosynthesis will remain a valuable teaching tool, and it will still be the way we think about organic chemistry. It will persist in various forms in the curriculum just as qualitative functional group analyses did, long after they died out in actual practice. Actual practice, meanwhile, will consist of more thinking about what molecules to make and why to make them, and a lot less thinking about “how”. That will only kick in for structures too complex for the software to handle, and that will be a gradually shrinking patch of ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will not go down easy for a lot of us. Thinking about how to make molecules has long been seen as one of the vital parts of organic chemistry, but knowing how to handle horses was long seen as a vital part of raising crops for food, too. It’ll be an adjustment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No memory of having starred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Atones for later disregard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Or keeps the end from being hard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s Robert Frost, and his advice in that poem was “&lt;a href=&quot;https://commonreader.wustl.edu/c/provide-provide/&quot;&gt;Provide, Provide!&lt;/a&gt;” We’ll have to.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><width>1136</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>1194</height><url>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Route.jpeg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>There’s yet another paper on computer-devised retrosynthesis out today – it and the previous one make an interesting pair.

Background &lt;p&gt;Phenylephrine is an α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; adrenergic receptor agonist that causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, and so may effectively enhance hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). However, there is little evidence that phenylephrine augments HPV in clinical situations. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of phenylephrine infusion on oxygenation during one-lung ventilation (OLV) in patients undergoing thoracic surgery.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Included patients were those undergoing elective thoracic surgery in the lateral decubitus position with OLV. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. The N-P group initially had OLV with normal saline infusion for 30 minutes; after a 10 minute interval, OLV was then maintained with phenylephrine infusion for 30 minutes. The P-N group had the drug-infusion in the reverse order. The primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Secondary outcomes were mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulse pressure variation, perfusion index, and difference between bladder and skin temperature. Statistical analysis was performed using the student t-test, Fisher&apos;s exact test, and ANOVA for Cross-over design. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine patients were analyzed.

There is a marked comorbidity between alcohol abuse and eating disorders, especially in the young population. We have previously reported that bingeing on fat during adolescence increases the rewarding effects of ethanol (EtOH). The aim of the present work was to study if vulnerability to EtOH persists after cessation of binge eating. OF1 mice binged on fat (HFB: high-fat binge) during adolescence (PND 25–43) and were tested for 15 days after the last access to HFB (on PND 59) using the self-administration paradigm, the conditioned place preference (CPP) and locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Our results showed that after 15 days of cessation of fat ingestion, mice increased their consumption of ethanol and showed greater motivation to obtain ethanol. On the other hand, no effects were observed in the CPP, while an increased locomotor response to ethanol was detected. The present results confirm and extend our previous study demonstrating that the compulsive intake of fat induces long-lasting effects on the reward system that lead to an increased consumption of EtOH.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>M.

Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-wave states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-wave ripples.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522345097000</published><title>Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses</title></item><item><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</originId><published>1522662194705</published><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25220?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>NA</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_16285bd3e11:8aa3033:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522662194705</crawled><fingerprint>dbe24ec4</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=1096987x&amp;type=etoc&amp;feed=rss</streamId><htmlUrl>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/1096987x?af=R</htmlUrl><title>Wiley: Journal of Computational Chemistry: Table of Contents</title></origin><description>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</description><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><title>Quantum chemical exploration of formaldehyde clusters (H2CO)n (n = 2–4)</title></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244913v2?rss=1</originId><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244913v2?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/244913v2?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Protein-protein interactions control a large range of biological processes and their identification is essential to understand the underlying biological mechanisms.

It makes sense – if you want things to react, getting all the partners dissolved in some medium where they can roam around and contact each other is surely the way to go, most of the time. But it’s also true that we don’t really have a good grasp of what’s happening in solution at the molecular level. Solvation shells, nanoscale aggregates and clusters, effects of interfacial regions: the idealized picture of things floating around is complicated by a lot of real-world effects, which can be very important. They’re particularly so when it comes to dissolution and its opposite, precipitation and crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the formation of microcrystals. I know that I had a mental picture of these that is probably incorrect. As I imagined it, all sorts of nucleation events happened in solution but the size of the resulting crystals was constrained (perhaps by amount of available solute, or by effects of stirring) so that they just didn’t grow very large. But in many systems, it appears that what happens first is a liquid-liquid phase separation (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/01/condensates-a-new-organizing-principle-in-cells&quot;&gt;sound familiar?&lt;/a&gt;), what’s called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition&quot;&gt;spinodal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; into microscopic solute-rich and solute-poor droplets, and the solute-rich ones then crystallize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201711128&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; provides another example of liquid-phase weirdness. The authors are looking at a very well-known reaction, reduction of a metal salt to the elemental metal. That sentence hides a lot of complications: for example, what form does this metal arrive in? You can get a mirror deposit on the inside wall of the vessel (as with the famous old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tollens%27_reagent&quot;&gt;Tollens reagent&lt;/a&gt; or the other more stable mirror-silvering mixtures), but more often you get some sort of fine black powder. Microscopic examination of that, though, reveals a huge range of particle sizes and morphologies depending on conditions, and it’s just those changes that can make a big difference in (for example) catalyst performance. Finely divided high-surface-area metals (palladium/platinum on carbon, Raney nickel, Rieke metals) are very important in synthetic chemistry, and their properties vary tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work provides an ingenious variation. The authors take an aqueous solution of the metal salt (silver nitrate in the first example), freeze it in liquid nitrogen, and then let this ice chunk slowly dissolve in a cold solution of the reducing agent (sodium borohydride). That gives, under the right conditions, essentially an atom-by-atom release of silver ions into the solution, and what you get out is atomically dispersed metal. By electron microscopy, the great bulk of the material is produced as what are apparently single silver atoms, not clusters, aggregates, etc. (there’s also further characterization by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_X-ray_absorption_fine_structure&quot;&gt;EXAFS&lt;/a&gt;). I’m surprised that it doesn’t form those on standing, but as I said before, there are a lot of things about the solution phase that my mental models don’t handle well. The authors believe (on the basis of modeling calculations) that the solvation shell around the single metal atoms is a barrier to forming such nanoparticles, and that the release of individual metal atoms is thus key to the whole process. Dimers of silver atoms and the like seem to be just fine in aqueous solution if they can form (or if they’re whittled down to that size); this synthesis just doesn’t let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the same sort of chemistry with a whole list of metals – platinum, palladium, cobalt, nickel, copper, iridium, gold and more. It certainly seems to be a general process, and the resulting atomically dispersed metals would, you’d have to imagine, be very active catalysts in further reactions. What’s more, this entire method would seem to have applications in many other reactions, too, where the slow release of one reactant into an excess of another is important. I’m actually kicking myself not to have thought of something like this – in hindsight it seems like a perfectly simple idea, but try coming up with these in the forward direction!&lt;/p&gt;

The range of prey total lengths increased with predator total length. The median and maximum ingested prey total length varied with predator taxon and length, but generally ranged from 10–20% and 32–46% of predator total length, respectively. Predators tended to consume larger fusiform prey than laterally compressed prey. With the exception of large muskellunge, predators most commonly consumed prey between 16 and 73 mm.

Hydraulic fracturing can improve the permeability of coalbed methane (CBM) reservoirs effectively, which is of great significance to the commercial production of CBM. However, the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing is affected by multiple factors. The mechanism of fracture initiation, morphology and propagation in CBM reservoirs is not clear and need to be further explored. Hydraulic fracturing experiment is an accurate tool to explore these mechanisms. The quantity of experimental coal rock is large and processing method is complex, so specimen made of similar materials was applied to replace coal rock. The true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experimental apparatus, 3D scanning device for coal rock section were applied to carry out hydraulic fracturing experiment. The results show that the initiation pressure is inversely proportional to the horizontal stress difference (Δσ) and positively related to fracturing fluid injection rate. When vertical stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) is constant, the initiation pressure and fracture width decrease with the increasing of Δσ. Natural fractures can be connected by main fracture when propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum horizontal stress (σ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;), then secondary fractures and fracture network form in CBM reservoirs. When two stresses of crustal stress are close and far different from the third one, the fracture morphology and propagation become complex. Influenced by perforations and filtration of fracturing fluid in specimen, fracturing fluid flows to downward easily after comparing horizontal well fracturing with vertical well fracturing. Fracture width increases with the decreasing of elastic modulus, the intensity of fracture is positively related with the elastic modulus of coal rock. The research results can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the efficient development of CBM.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Fan Zhang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195363</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f4617:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>90602380</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fan Zhang, Geng Ma, Xiao Liu, Yunqi Tao, Dan Feng, Rui Li&lt;/p&gt;

Public availability of datasets is growing in all disciplines, because it is considered to be a good scientific practice (e.g. to enable reproducibility), and/or it is mandated by funding agencies, scientific journals. Science is now a data-intensive discipline and therefore, new and innovative ways for data management, data sharing, and for discovering novel datasets are increasingly required. In 2016, we released the first version of the Omics Discovery Index (www.omicsdi.org) as a light-weight system to aggregate datasets across multiple public omics data resources.

Public availability of datasets is growing in all disciplines, because it is considered to be a good scientific practice (e.g. to enable reproducibility), and/or it is mandated by funding agencies, scientific journals. Science is now a data-intensive discipline and therefore, new and innovative ways for data management, data sharing, and for discovering novel datasets are increasingly required. In 2016, we released the first version of the Omics Discovery Index (www.omicsdi.org) as a light-weight system to aggregate datasets across multiple public omics data resources. OmicsDI integrates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and multi-omics datasets, as well as computational models of biological processes. Here, we propose a set of novel metrics to quantify the impact of biomedical datasets. A complete framework (now integrated into OmicsDI) has been implemented in order to provide and evaluate those metrics. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for authors, journals, and data resources to promote an optimal quantification of the impact of datasets.</description><published>1521010800000</published><title>Quantifying the impact of public omics data [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23277-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23277-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/fQ9QWVAT5b8/s41598-018-23277-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Preclinical Development of a Novel, Orally-Administered Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Domain Antibody for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preclinical Development of a Novel, Orally-Administered Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Domain Antibody for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-23277-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-23277-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Preclinical Development of a Novel, Orally-Administered Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Domain Antibody for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/fQ9QWVAT5b8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><author><name>J.

SPORTS1.0 is an open-source software deposited at https://github.com/junchaoshi/sports1.0.</description><published>1523084400000</published><title>SPORTS1.0: a tool for annotating and profiling non-coding RNAs optimized for rRNA- and tRNA- derived small RNAs [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><url>none</url></visual><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>The PLOS ONE Staff</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195417</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde39:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>1338c6f1</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by The PLOS ONE Staff &lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522357200000</published><title>Correction: SubID, a non-median dichotomization tool for heterogeneous populations, reveals the pan-cancer significance of &amp;lt;i&gt;INPP4B&amp;lt;/i&gt; and its regulation by EVI1 in AML</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010</originId><author><name>Yogesh Patil, Panayiotis Bilalis, George Polymeropoulos, Sarah Almahdali, Nikos Hadjichristidis, Valentin Rodionov</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/gHGE0fgF_2E/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>203</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010/20180319/images/medium/mp-2018-000104_0005.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010</href></item></canonical><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010/20180319/images/medium/mp-2018-000104_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00010&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Many fossil specimens exhibit deformations caused by taphonomic processes. Due to these deformations, even important specimens have to be excluded from morphometric analyses, impoverishing an already poor paleontological record. Techniques to retrodeform and virtually restore damaged (i.e. deformed) specimens are available, but these methods genenerally imply the use of a sparse set of bilateral landmarks, ignoring the fact that the distribution and amount of control points directly affects the result of the retrodeformation. We propose a method developed in the R environment and available in the R-package “Morpho” that, in addition to the landmark configurations, also allows using a set of semi-landmarks homogeneously distributed along curves and on surfaces. We evaluated the outcome of the retrodeformation, regarding the number of semi-landmarks used and its robustness against asymmetric noise, based on simulations using a virtually deformed gorilla cranium. Finally, we applied the method to a well-known Neanderthal cranium that exhibits signs of taphonomically induced asymmetry.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Stefan Schlager</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194073</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88eb:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>eedb143f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Schlager, Antonio Profico, Fabio Di Vincenzo, Giorgio Manzi&lt;/p&gt;

Thorough understanding of biodiversity is a fundamental prerequisite for biological research. A lack of taxonomic knowledge and species misidentifications are particularly critical for conservation. Here we present an example of &lt;i&gt;Potamogeton floridanus&lt;/i&gt;, the Florida Pondweed, an endangered taxon endemic to a small area in the Florida panhandle, whose taxonomic status remained controversial for more than a century, and all previous attempts to elucidate its identity have failed. We applied molecular approaches to tackle the origin of the mysterious taxon and supplemented them with morphological and anatomical investigations of both historical herbarium collections and plants recently collected in the type area for a comprehensive taxonomic reassessment. Sequencing of two nuclear ribosomal markers and one chloroplast non-coding spacer resulted in the surprising discovery that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;floridanus&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pulcher&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;, with the former being the maternal parent. The hybrid colony is currently geographically isolated from the distribution range of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;oakesianus&lt;/i&gt;. We show that previous molecular analyses have failed to reveal its hybrid identity due to inadequate nuclear DNA sequence editing. This is an example how the uncritical use of automized sequence reads can hamper molecular species identifications and also affect phylogenetic tree construction and interpretation.

KrakenHLL&apos;s run time is similar to that of Kraken, and it requires only a very modest increase in memory.</description><published>1522738800000</published><title>KrakenHLL: Confident and fast metagenomics classification using unique k-mer counts [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03556-7</originId><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03556-7</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/UgTD3Fp6xR0/s41467-018-03556-7</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;nc886 is induced by TGF-β and suppresses the microRNA pathway in ovarian cancer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nc886 is induced by TGF-β and suppresses the microRNA pathway in ovarian cancer, Published online: 21 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03556-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03556-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Ovarian cancers often display elevated TGF-β signaling but repressed miRNA expression.

Background &lt;p&gt;Access to medicines without prescription is a major contributing factor for self-medication practices. This study was designed to examine the ratio of non-prescribed medicines sales and self-medication practices in Punjab, Pakistan. This study also evaluates the reasons for self-medication within its communities.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An observational study was conducted in 272 systemically selected pharmacies to analyze medicines-related sales, with or without prescription. A cross-sectional survey was performed between June 2015 and November 2016. Consumers were interviewed about their self-medication practices.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the pharmacies surveyed, 65.3% participated in the study. A total of 4348 medicines were purchased for self-medication by 3037 consumers (15.2% of all study participants), of which 873 (28.7%) participated in an interview. Majority (81.2%) medicine purchaser, (90.9%) interview participants, and (59.4%) drug users were male. On average, each community pharmacy sold 7.9 medicines without prescription each day, to an average of 5.5 customers. Many participants (28.9%) had matriculation in their formal education. The medicines most often sold for self-medication were analgesics and antipyretics(39.4%). More than 25% of participants reported fever symptoms and 47.8% assumed their illness was too trivial to consult a doctor. Media advertisements were the most common source of information for participants (46.7%).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many types of medicines were often sold without prescription from community pharmacies. Self-medication was common practice for a wide range of illnesses. Pakistan also needs effective implementation of policies to monitor medication sales.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;As atrial fibrillation (AF) is often asymptomatic, it may remain undiagnosed until or even after development of complications, such as stroke. Consequently the observed prevalence of AF may underestimate total disease burden.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;To estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed AF in the United States, we performed a retrospective cohort modeling study in working age (18–64) and elderly (≥65) people using commercial and Medicare administrative claims databases. We identified patients in years 2004–2010 with incident AF following an ischemic stroke. Using a back-calculation methodology, we estimated the prevalence of undiagnosed AF as the ratio of the number of post-stroke AF patients and the CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-specific stroke probability for each patient, adjusting for age and gender composition based on United States census data.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The estimated prevalence of AF (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was 3,873,900 (95%CI: 3,675,200–4,702,600) elderly and 1,457,100 (95%CI: 1,218,500–1,695,800) working age adults, representing 10.0% and 0.92% of the respective populations. Of these, 698,900 were undiagnosed: 535,400 (95%CI: 331,900–804,400) elderly and 163,500 (95%CI: 17,700–400,000) working age adults, representing 1.3% and 0.09% of the respective populations. Among all undiagnosed cases, 77% had a CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥1, and 56% had CHADS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; score ≥2.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Using a back-calculation approach, we estimate that the total AF prevalence in 2009 was 5.3 million of which 0.7 million (13.1% of AF cases) were undiagnosed. Over half of the modeled population with undiagnosed AF was at moderate to high risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Mintu P.

Thus, we identified a mechanism that enhances host defenses while simultaneously suppressing neutrophil-mediated pulmonary damage in bacterial pneumonia. IP6K1 is, therefore, a legitimate therapeutic target for such disease.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1522864189000</published><title>[Research Articles] Inhibition of IP6K1 suppresses neutrophil-mediated pulmonary damage in bacterial pneumonia</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194578</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194578</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194578</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos A.

Investigating cerebral metabolism &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; at a microscopic level is essential for understanding brain function and its pathological alterations. The intricate signaling and metabolic dynamics between neurons, glia, and microvasculature requires much more detailed understanding to better comprehend the mechanisms governing brain function and its disease-related changes. We recently demonstrated that pharmacologically-induced alterations to different steps of cerebral metabolism can be distinguished utilizing 2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging of endogenous reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we evaluate the ability of the phasor analysis method to identify these pharmacological metabolic alterations and compare the method’s performance with more conventional nonlinear curve-fitting analysis. Visualization of phasor data, both at the fundamental laser repetition frequency and its second harmonic, enables resolution of pharmacologically-induced alterations to mitochondrial metabolic processes from baseline cerebral metabolism. Compared to our previous classification models based on nonlinear curve-fitting, phasor–based models required fewer parameters and yielded comparable or improved classification accuracy. Fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH and phasor analysis shows utility for detecting metabolic alterations and will lead to a deeper understanding of cerebral energetics and its pathological changes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521666000000</updated><author><name>Carlos A.

Performance-based financing (PBF) schemes have been expanding rapidly across low and middle income countries in the past decade, with considerable external financing from multilateral, bilateral and global health initiatives. Many of these countries have been fragile and conflict-affected (FCAS), but while the influence of context is acknowledged to be important to the operation of PBF, there has been little examination of how it affects adoption and implementation of PBF. This article lays out initial hypotheses about how FCAS contexts may influence the adoption, adaption, implementation and health system effects of PBF. These are then interrogated through a review of available grey and published literature (140 documents in total, covering 23 PBF schemes). We find that PBF has been more common in FCAS contexts, which were also more commonly early adopters. Very little explanation of the rationale for its adoption, in particular in relation with the contextual features, is given in programme documents. However, there are a number of factors which could explain this, including the greater role of external actors and donors, a greater openness to institutional reform, and lower levels of trust within the public system and between government and donors, all of which favour more contractual approaches. These suggest that rather than emerging despite fragility, conditions of fragility may favour the rapid emergence of PBF. We also document few emerging adaptations of PBF to humanitarian settings and limited evidence of health system effects which may be contextually driven, but these require more in-depth analysis. Another area meriting more study is the political economy of PBF and its diffusion across contexts.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522789200000</updated><author><name>Maria Paola Bertone</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195301</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628c9a1645:9532f62:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522777331269</crawled><fingerprint>47fe2690</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maria Paola Bertone, Jean-Benoît Falisse, Giuliano Russo, Sophie Witter&lt;/p&gt;

We will start with the cases of Elizabeth Holmes and Ramesh (“Sunny”) Balwani, of Theranos. As the world knows, Theranos was not what it was represented to be – John Carreyrou of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; and his extraordinary demolition job on them showed that beyond doubt. But remember, those articles were devastating because they &lt;em&gt;told the truth about what was happening&lt;/em&gt;. In these times, it’s important to remember that truth exists, that it exists outside our opinions, and that no amount of spin, hype, and sheer bull keeps it from being the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s worth remembering as you see the clip below. This is Holmes on CNBC, after the accusations against Theranos had already started to come out. And what you’re seeing is a firehose of falsehoods, knowingly delivered straight into the camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compare what’s being said with what’s in the SEC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-41-theranos-holmes.pdf&quot;&gt;recently released complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Holmes. She would bring in potential investors and at one point in the pitch have a drop of their blood taken for analysis in a Theranos machine – but that’s not what was used to analyze it. Because it couldn’t. As Carreyrou reported, the company was reliant on existing third-party instruments, because its own hardware never, ever became capable enough to live up to the company’s public statements about it. Holmes stated, over and over, that Theranos was able to run tests covering over 1,000 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes: they could actually run twelve. Holmes and the company explicitly stated that they bought no technology from third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors would also get a binder of slides, documents, and endorsements, featuring (among other things) letters with the logos of various prominent pharmaceutical companies about their clinical work with Theranos. Those companies did not write the letters – Theranos employees did, pasting in the corporate logos. Investors were told that Theranos had worked extensively with the Department of Defense, and that their machines had been deployed on medevac helicopters in Afghanistan, which was a total fabrication. Financial projections showed them rolling out their machines to hundreds of Walgreens stores, when Holmes knew, in detail, that Walgreens was already having serious doubts about dealing with Theranos at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes on. But it’s worth keeping all this in mind as you watch that interview – skip through it, and you’ll see Elizabeth Holmes clearly and confidently lying, utterly misrepresenting the facts of the situation, smiling, and then utterly misrepresenting them some more. With no apparent qualm and no particular affect other than that of a person making her righteous case with the facts on her side. It’s worth thinking about. Theranos raised more than $700 million from private investors through this sort of behavior. Most of us do not have anywhere near the level of nerve (among other qualities) needed to pull something like this off, nor would it occur to us to do so in the first place. But there are people among us who do it cheerful, as a character in H. G. Wells says about a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.literaturepage.com/read/waroftheworlds-144.html&quot;&gt;similar opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for human predation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I forgot to mention another point that I was thinking about. As the SEC complaint notes, Holmes (but not Balwani) has already agreed to penalties for their behavior – financial and operational ones. I have no desire to defend Martin Shkreli at all, but the fact that he is starting a seven-year prison sentence while Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani are walking around freely seems like an injustice. And no, I’m not suggesting letting Shkreli out. The other solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That may still be an option, though: the SEC has civil enforcement authority, but criminal prosecution is another matter. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to another set of lies, and that will be enough for one morning. As many will have seen, the British government has expelled a list of Russian diplomats over the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/08/a-poisoning-in-england-but-which-poison&quot;&gt;Skripal poisoning case&lt;/a&gt;. (I am no particular admirer of Theresa May, but her statement about this incident did her and the UK credit). The nerve agent &lt;a href=&quot;https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i12/Nerve-agent-attack-on-spy-used-Novichok-poison.html&quot;&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; is a known Russian-developed “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent&quot;&gt;Novichok&lt;/a&gt;” compound, a newer variety of organophosphorus poison. While it is certainly possible that such a compound could have been produced by a third party, it would require a very dedicated one indeed, since no details of the structures or synthesis have ever appeared in the scientific literature. The chemistry of the organophosphorus nerve agents is not particularly difficult (as was remarked in that earlier post), but that’s if you &lt;em&gt;already know the optimized reactions and conditions&lt;/em&gt;. Doing route discovery on latest-generation nerve agents is not a casual undertaking, and anyone trying it outside of a very well-equipped lab setting is likely to die in the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart Cantrill’s Twitter feed this morning put me on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tobyperkinsmp/status/974219780021542912&quot;&gt;this exchange&lt;/a&gt; about the identification of the compound. Apparently there are a number of people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/the-novichok-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/&quot;&gt;saying that&lt;/a&gt; there’s no way that this compound could have been identified without a reference sample, there’s no proof that these are associated with Russian chemical warfare research, etc. Needless to say, I side with Clyde Davies in that Twitter exchange linked above. The evidence is extremely strong that this was a Russian operation, and the often-flippant response of the Russian authorities to the entire case does nothing to dispel that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already had comments on the earlier post throwing doubt and uncertainly about this case (and the earlier Litvinenko assassination, even). More of these may accrue to this post as well. Some of these may in fact be honest doubts from extremely skeptical onlookers – but others are surely lies. Smiling, straight-into-the-camera-lens lies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>]\Today’s topic is “lies”.

Continuous monitoring of physiological parameters inside a living cell will lead to major advances in our understanding of biology and complex diseases, such as cancer. It also enables the development of new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. Progress in nanofabrication and wireless communication has opened up the potential of making a wireless chip small enough that it can be wholly inserted into a living cell. To investigate how such chips could be internalized into various types of living single cells and how this process might affect cells’ physiology, we designed and fabricated a series of multilayered micron-scale tag structures with different sizes as potential RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) cell trackers. While the present structures are test structures that do not resonate, the tags that do resonate have similar structure from device fabrication, material properties, and device size point of view. The structures are in four different sizes, the largest with the lateral dimension of 9 μm × 21 μm. The thickness for these structures is kept constant at 1.5 μm. We demonstrate successful delivery of our fabricated chips into various types of living cells, such as melanoma skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer and healthy/normal fibroblast skin cells. To our surprise, we observed a remarkable internalization rate difference between each cell type; the uptake rate was faster for more aggressive cancer cells than the normal/healthy cells. Cell viability before and after tag cellular internalization and persistence of the internalized tags have also been recorded over the course of five days of incubation. These results establish the foundations of the possibility of long term, wireless, intracellular physiological signal monitoring.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Kokab B.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between stone composition and single-energy noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) parameters, including stone heterogeneity index (SHI) and mean stone density (MSD), in patients with urinary calculi. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 255 patients who underwent operations or procedures for urinary stones or had spontaneous stone passage between December 2014 and October 2015. Among these, 214 patients with urinary calculi who underwent NCCT and stone composition analyses were included in the study. Maximal stone length (MSL), mean stone density (MSD), and stone heterogeneity index (SHI) were determined on pretreatment NCCT. The mean MSD (454.68±177.80 HU) and SHI (115.82±96.31 HU) of uric acid stones were lower than those of all other types. Based on post hoc tests, MSD was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001). SHI was lower for uric acid stones than for the other types (vs. CaOx: P&amp;lt;0.001; vs. infection stones: P&amp;lt;0.001) Receiver operating characteristic curves of uric acid stones for MSD and SHI demonstrated that SHI (cut-off value: 140.4 HU) was superior to MSD (cut-off value: 572.3 HU) in predicting uric acid stones (P&amp;lt;0.001).</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523566800000</updated><author><name>Jong Soo Lee</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162baf60ff2:fc7124:34f43e70</id><crawled>1523555110898</crawled><fingerprint>a9b18625</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jong Soo Lee, Kang Su Cho, Seung Hwan Lee, Young Eun Yoon, Dong Hyuk Kang, Won Sik Jeong, Hae Do Jung, Jong Kyou Kwon, Joo Yong Lee&lt;/p&gt;

Animal models commonly serve as a bridge between &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments and clinical applications; however, few physiological processes in adult animals are sufficient to serve as proof-of-concept models for cartilage regeneration. Intriguingly, some rodents, such as young adult mice, undergo physiological connective tissue modifications to birth canal elements such as the pubic symphysis during pregnancy; therefore, we investigated whether the differential expression of cartilage differentiation markers is associated with cartilaginous tissue morphological modifications during these changes. Our results showed that osteochondral progenitor cells expressing &lt;i&gt;Runx2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Col2a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dcx&lt;/i&gt; at the non-pregnant pubic symphysis proliferated and differentiated throughout pregnancy, giving rise to a complex osteoligamentous junction that attached the interpubic ligament to the pubic bones until labour occurred. After delivery, the recovery of pubic symphysis cartilaginous tissues was improved by the time-dependent expression of these chondrocytic lineage markers at the osteoligamentous junction. This process potentially recapitulates embryologic chondrocytic differentiation to successfully recover hyaline cartilaginous pads at 10 days postpartum. Therefore, we propose that this physiological phenomenon represents a proof-of-concept model for investigating the mechanisms involved in cartilage restoration in adult animals.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Bianca Gazieri Castelucci</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195304</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296e6b696:a4f460a:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522950125206</crawled><fingerprint>eb48fb60</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bianca Gazieri Castelucci, Sílvio Roberto Consonni, Viviane Souza Rosa, Lucimara Aparecida Sensiate, Paula Cristina Rugno Delatti, Lúcia Elvira Alvares, Paulo Pinto Joazeiro&lt;/p&gt;

TEs that are preferentially silenced in one species are a similar age to those silenced in both species, and are not more likely to be associated with expression divergence of nearby orthologous genes. Our data suggest limited species-specificity of TE silencing across six million years of primate evolution.</content></summary><title>Silencing of transposable elements may not be a major driver of regulatory evolution in primate iPSCs</title></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029463?af=R</originId><visual><url>none</url></visual><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029463?af=R</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5029463?af=R</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/13&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 13&lt;/a&gt;, April 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1522738011000</published><author><name>Jeremy C.

Our previous research demonstrated that tilianin protects the myocardium in a myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) rat model and has prominent pharmacological potential as a cardiovascular drug. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular signaling implicated in the improvement of myocardial survival induced by tilianin, a flavonoid antioxidant. Tilianin (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg/d) or saline was orally administered to rats for 14 days. On the 15th day, ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery for 45 min, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The levels of MIRI-induced serum myocardial enzymes and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as well as infarct size were examined to assess the cardioprotective effects. Cardiac tissues were collected for western blot analyses to determine the protein expression of anti-apoptotic signaling molecules. In MIRI-treated rats, our results revealed that pre-administration of high dose-tilianin the reduced release of LDH, MDA, and CK-MB and increased the plasma SOD level, and significantly attenuated the infarct size. Western blot analysis showed that a remarkable rise in expression of Bcl-2 and XIAP, and decline in expression of Bax, Smac/Diablo, HtrA2/Omi, cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 was observed in the myocardium. The apoptosis index of cardiomyocytes further supports the cardioprotective effect of tilianin. Additionally, compared with the MIRI model group, pretreatment with high dose-tilianin group upregulated phosphorylated Akt and PI3K. In contrast, using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block Akt activation effectively inhibited the protective effects of tilianin against MIRI. Tilianin pretreatment was beneficial for activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting myocardial apoptosis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Cheng Zeng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0193845</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fa:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>b672c86a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cheng Zeng, Wen Jiang, Ruifang Zheng, Chenghui He, Jianguang Li, Jianguo Xing&lt;/p&gt;

The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), also called the GABAergic tail of the ventral tegmental area, projects to the midbrain dopaminergic system, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and other regions. Whether the RMTg is involved in sleep–wake regulation is unknown. In the present study, pharmacogenetic activation of rat RMTg neurons promoted non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep with increased slow-wave activity (SWA). Conversely, rats after neurotoxic lesions of 8 or 16 days showed decreased NREM sleep with reduced SWA at lights on, which persisted until after lesions of 25 days. Similarly, pharmacological and pharmacogenetic inactivation of rat RMTg neurons decreased NREM sleep. Electrophysiological experiments combined with optogenetics showed a direct inhibitory connection between the terminals of RMTg neurons and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The bidirectional effects of the RMTg on the sleep–wake cycle were mimicked by the modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA)/substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neuronal activity using a pharmacogenetic approach. Furthermore, during the 2-hour recovery period following 6-hour sleep deprivation, the amount of NREM sleep in both the lesion and control rats was significantly increased compared with baseline levels; however, only the control rats showed a significant increase in SWA compared with baseline levels. Collectively, our findings reveal an essential role of the RMTg in the promotion of NREM sleep and homeostatic regulation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oTjEGC4Ged0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2002909</href></item></canonical><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2002909</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162c02eb7f8:4e48a:a077e55f</id><crawled>1523642710008</crawled><fingerprint>6f4b452d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Su-Rong Yang, Zhen-Zhen Hu, Yan-Jia Luo, Ya-Nan Zhao, Huan-Xin Sun, Dou Yin, Chen-Yao Wang, Yu-Dong Yan, Dian-Ru Wang, Xiang-Shan Yuan, Chen-Bo Ye, Wei Guo, Wei-Min Qu, Yoan Cherasse, Michael Lazarus, Yu-Qiang Ding, Zhi-Li Huang&lt;/p&gt;

In this paper we report the development of a cost-effective, modular, open source, and fully automated slide-scanning microscope, composed entirely of easily available off-the-shelf parts, and capable of bright field and fluorescence modes. The automated X-Y stage is composed of two low-cost micrometer stages coupled to stepper motors operated in open-loop mode. The microscope is composed of a low-cost CMOS sensor and low-cost board lenses placed in a 4f configuration. The system has approximately 1 micron resolution, limited by the f/# of available board lenses. The microscope is compact, measuring just 25×25×30 cm, and has an absolute positioning accuracy of ±1 μm in the X and Y directions. A Z-stage enables autofocusing and imaging over large fields of view even on non-planar samples, and custom software enables automatic determination of sample boundaries and image mosaicking. We demonstrate the utility of our device through imaging of fluorescent- and transmission-dye stained blood and fecal smears containing human and animal parasites, as well as several prepared tissue samples. These results demonstrate image quality comparable to high-end commercial microscopes at a cost of less than US$400 for a bright-field system, with an extra US$100 needed for the fluorescence module.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Qiang Lu</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194063</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e01:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>80970825</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Qiang Lu, Guanghui Liu, Chuanli Xiao, Chuanzhen Hu, Shiwu Zhang, Ronald X.

Cadmium exposure can cause renal tubular dysfunction. Recent studies show that vitamin D can play multiple roles in the body. However, the association between serum vitamin D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a general population exposed to cadmium has not been clarified. We performed study to assess the effects of cadmium on serum 25(OH) D levels and the association between serum 25(OH) D levels and renal tubular dysfunction in a population environmentally exposed to cadmium. A total of 133 subjects living in control area and two cadmium polluted areas were included in the present study. Cadmium in urine (UCd) and blood (BCd), urinary β2Microglobulin (UBMG), urinary retinol binding protein (URBP) and serum 25 (OH) D were determined. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between 25 (OH) D and prevalence of renal tubular dysfunction. No significant differences were observed in serum 25(OH) D levels among the four quartile of UCd and BCd after adjusting with cofounders. After adjusted with the confounders, the odds ratio (OR) of subjects with 25(OH) D ≥ 40 ng/ml were 0.20 (95%CI: 0.1–0.8) if UBMG was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction and 0.28 (95%CI: 0.1–1.1) if URBP was chosen as indicators of renal dysfunction, compared with those with 25(OH) D &amp;lt; 30 ng/ml, respectively. Similar results were observed in those subjects living in cadmium polluted areas or with high level of UCd or BCd. Our data indicated that cadmium exposure did not affect serum 25(OH) D level and high 25 (OH) D levels were associated with a decreased risk of renal tubular dysfunction induced by cadmium.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523394000000</updated><author><name>Xiao Chen</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195682</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162b0a68929:1efc9be:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523382126889</crawled><fingerprint>2c4ab63a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiao Chen, Yan Dai, Zhongqiu Wang, Guoying Zhu, Xiaoqiang Ding, Taiyi Jin&lt;/p&gt;

The current study aimed to assess the potential of different exercises triggering an osteogenic response at the femoral neck in a group of postmenopausal women. The osteogenic potential was determined by ranking the peak hip contact forces (HCFs) and consequent peak tensile and compressive strains at the superior and inferior part of the femoral neck during activities such as (fast) walking, running and resistance training exercises. Results indicate that fast walking (5–6 km/h) running and hopping induced significantly higher strains at the femoral neck than walking at 4 km/h which is considered a baseline exercise for bone preservation. Exercises with a high fracture risk such as hopping, need to be considered carefully especially in a frail elderly population and may therefore not be suitable as a training exercise. Since superior femoral neck frailness is related to elevated hip fracture risk, exercises such as fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running can be highly recommended to stimulate this particular area. Our results suggest that a training program including fast walking (above 5 km/h) and running exercises may increase or preserve the bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Pim Pellikaan</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195463</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57606:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>19023cab</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pim Pellikaan, Georgios Giarmatzis, Jos Vander Sloten, Sabine Verschueren, Ilse Jonkers&lt;/p&gt;

Heterotrophic marine nanoflagellates are important grazers on bacteria in the water column. Some marine bacteria appear more resistant to grazing than do others. Marine nanoflagellates can be grown in the laboratory in batch cultures fed specific bacterial isolates. In some cultures, the flagellates appear unable to completely deplete the bacterial prey even when the bacterial strain otherwise is an excellent prey. This may indicate that some marine bacteria are able to induce defence mechanisms if they are grazed by nanoflagellates. Four morphologically distinct marine heterotrophic nanoflagellates, of which 3 were still identified as &lt;i&gt;Procryptobia sorokini&lt;/i&gt; (Kinetoplastea) and one as &lt;i&gt;Paraphysomonas imperforata&lt;/i&gt; (Chrysophyceae) were isolated from a coastal location along with 3 isolates of the marine bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; sp. Flagellate growth and grazing on bacterial prey were analysed in batch cultures. &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; was a suitable prey for all 4 flagellate isolates. They grazed and grew on &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; as sole prey with maximal cell-specific growth rates of 0.1–0.25 h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and gross growth efficiencies of 38–61%. Exposure to dense flagellate cultures or their supernatants did, however, cause a fraction of the &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; cells to aggregate and the bacterium became apparently resistant to grazing. Concentrations of suspended &lt;i&gt;Pseudoalteromonas&lt;/i&gt; cells were therefore not decreased below 1,700–7,500 cells μL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; by any of the flagellate isolates.

Globally, the number of dengue cases has been on the increase since 1990 and this trend has also been found in Brazil and its most populated city—São Paulo. Surveillance systems based on predictions allow for timely decision making processes, and in turn, timely and efficient interventions to reduce the burden of the disease. We conducted a comparative study of dengue predictions in São Paulo city to test the performance of trained seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, generalized additive models and artificial neural networks. We also used a naïve model as a benchmark. A generalized additive model with lags of the number of cases and meteorological variables had the best performance, predicted epidemics of unprecedented magnitude and its performance was 3.16 times higher than the benchmark and 1.47 higher that the next best performing model. The predictive models captured the seasonal patterns but differed in their capacity to anticipate large epidemics and all outperformed the benchmark. In addition to be able to predict epidemics of unprecedented magnitude, the best model had computational advantages, since its training and tuning was straightforward and required seconds or at most few minutes. These are desired characteristics to provide timely results for decision makers. However, it should be noted that predictions are made just one month ahead and this is a limitation that future studies could try to reduce.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Oswaldo Santos Baquero</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195065</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c7691f:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>3294b76</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Oswaldo Santos Baquero, Lidia Maria Reis Santana, Francisco Chiaravalloti-Neto&lt;/p&gt;

Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.</description><published>1523516400000</published><title>Dilution and titration of cell-cycle regulators may control cell size in budding yeast [NEW RESULTS]</title></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31347</originId><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31347</link><crawled>1522134293218</crawled><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522108800000</published><author><name>juergen.knoblich@imba.oeaw.ac.at (Anne-Sophie Laurenson)</name></author><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31347</canonicalUrl><engagement>4</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16266461ae2:5f5b93f:34f43e70</id><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31347</href></item></alternate><fingerprint>8c9688a3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><description>Tumor cells display features that are not found in healthy cells.

Although tau pathology, behavioral deficits, and neuronal loss are observed in patients with tauopathies, the relationship between these endpoints has not been clearly established. Here we found that rTg4510 mice, which overexpress human mutant tau in the forebrain, develop progressive age-dependent increases in locomotor activity (LMA), which correlates with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, hyperphosphorylated tau levels, and brain atrophy. To further clarify the relationship between these endpoints, we treated the rTg4510 mice with either doxycycline to reduce mutant tau expression or an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor Thiamet G, which has been shown to ameliorate tau pathology in animal models. We found that both doxycycline and Thiamet G treatments starting at 2 months of age prevented the progression of hyperactivity, slowed brain atrophy, and reduced brain hyperphosphorylated tau. In contrast, initiating doxycycline treatment at 4 months reduced neither brain hyperphosphorylated tau nor hyperactivity, further confirming the relationship between these measures. Collectively, our results demonstrate a unique behavioral phenotype in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy that strongly correlates with disease progression, and that early interventions which reduce tau pathology ameliorate the progression of the locomotor dysfunction. These findings suggest that better understanding the relationship between locomotor deficits and tau pathology in the rTg4510 model may improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying behavioral disturbances in patients with tauopathies.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Xiaohai Wang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195486</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd07f:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>b761e70b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohai Wang, Karen Smith, Michelle Pearson, Anna Hughes, Mali L.

Changes in pathogen genetic variation within hosts alter the severity and spread of infectious diseases, with important implications for clinical disease and public health. Genetic drift may play a strong role in shaping pathogen variation, but analyses of drift in pathogens have oversimplified pathogen population dynamics, either by considering dynamics only at a single scale—such as within hosts or between hosts—or by making drastic simplifying assumptions, for example, that host immune systems can be ignored or that transmission bottlenecks are complete. Moreover, previous studies have used genetic data to infer the strength of genetic drift, whereas we test whether the genetic drift imposed by pathogen population processes can be used to explain genetic data. We first constructed and parameterized a mathematical model of gypsy moth baculovirus dynamics that allows genetic drift to act within and between hosts. We then quantified the genome-wide diversity of baculovirus populations within each of 143 field-collected gypsy moth larvae using Illumina sequencing. Finally, we determined whether the genetic drift imposed by host–pathogen population dynamics in our model explains the levels of pathogen diversity in our data. We found that when the model allows drift to act at multiple scales—including within hosts, between hosts, and between years—it can accurately reproduce the data, but when the effects of drift are simplified by neglecting transmission bottlenecks and stochastic variation in virus replication within hosts, the model fails. A de novo mutation model and a purifying selection model similarly fail to explain the data. Our results show that genetic drift can play a strong role in determining pathogen variation and that mathematical models that account for pathogen population growth at multiple scales of biological organization can be used to explain this variation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bmOg3KEZQRc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004444</href></item></canonical><engagement>1</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004444</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1626db778eb:4248d5:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1522259163371</crawled><fingerprint>5f9b3962</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by David A.

Background &lt;p&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI), like most human phenotypes, is substantially heritable. However, BMI is not normally distributed; the skew appears to be structural, and increases as a function of age. Moreover, twin correlations for BMI commonly violate the assumptions of the most common variety of the classical twin model, with the MZ twin correlation greater than twice the DZ correlation. This study aimed to decompose twin correlations for BMI using more general skew-t distributions.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Same sex MZ and DZ twin pairs (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 7,086) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry were included. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) to decompose twin correlations for BMI into multiple mixture distributions. LPA was performed using the default normal mixture distribution and the skew-t mixture distribution. Similar analyses were performed for height as a comparison. Our analyses are then replicated in an independent dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A two-class solution under the skew-t mixture distribution fits the BMI distribution for both genders. The first class consists of a relatively normally distributed, highly heritable BMI with a mean in the normal range. The second class is a positively skewed BMI in the overweight and obese range, with lower twin correlations. In contrast, height is normally distributed, highly heritable, and is well-fit by a single latent class. Results in the replication dataset were highly similar.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that two distinct processes underlie the skew of the BMI distribution.

α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a major component of Lewy bodies found in synucleinopathies including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Under the pathological conditions, α-syn tends to generate a diverse form of aggregates showing toxicity to neuronal cells and able to transmit across cells. However, mechanisms by which α-syn aggregates affect cytotoxicity in neurons have not been fully elucidated. Here we report that α-syn aggregates preferentially sequester specific synaptic proteins such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) through direct binding which is resistant to SDS. The sequestration effect of α-syn aggregates was shown in a cell-free system, cultured primary neurons, and PD mouse model. Furthermore, we identified a specific blocking peptide derived from VAMP2 which partially inhibited the sequestration by α-syn aggregates and contributed to reduced neurotoxicity. These results provide a mechanism of neurotoxicity mediated by α-syn aggregates and suggest that the blocking peptide interfering with the pathological role of α-syn aggregates could be useful for designing a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of PD.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522702800000</updated><author><name>Mal-Gi Choi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195339</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1628773af75:8c76935:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522690928501</crawled><fingerprint>55727e5b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mal-Gi Choi, Mi Jin Kim, Do-Geun Kim, Ri Yu, You-Na Jang, Won-Jong Oh&lt;/p&gt;

Endogenous nicotine was confirmed to be present in tea plants (&lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tea samples from tea-producing regions in six Asian countries. All samples contained nicotine (0.011–0.694 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). Nicotine contents remained constant during manufacturing of green, oolong and black teas, implying that nicotine is stable against heating, drying, enzymatic oxidation and mechanical damage during processing. Flower buds and seeds of cultivar Yabukita also contained nicotine (0.030–0.041 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). A comparison of two cultivars revealed that higher nicotine contents were found in the black tea cultivar Benifuki. All plant parts of hydroponic Yabukita contained nicotine (0.003–0.013 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight). Tea cells cultured in B5 medium as well as roots and stems of tea seedlings contained nicotine levels similar to those of new leaves from field-grown plants. Although the levels of endogenous nicotine in tea plants are extremely low and sample contamination cannot be discounted, these levels exceed the maximum acceptable limit in Japan (0.01 μg g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; dry weight).</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><author><name>Takashi Ikka</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195422</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162ab80555f:171528c:9aea0a7d</id><crawled>1523295737183</crawled><fingerprint>dabd9ed3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takashi Ikka, Hiroto Yamashita, Ikuya Kurita, Yasuno Tanaka, Fumiya Taniguchi, Akiko Ogino, Kazuya Takeda, Nobuhiro Horie, Hiroshi Hojo, Fumio Nanjo, Akio Morita&lt;/p&gt;

Biomechanical studies have shown the use of suture anchors (SA) to be superior to the traditional transosseous sutures (TS) in the repair of quadriceps tendon rupture (QTR). This study aimed to analyze and compare the functional outcomes of patients treated for quadriceps tendon ruptures using suture anchors or transosseous sutures. Patients having undergone suture anchor repair or transosseous suture repair for quadriceps tendon rupture between 2010 and 2015 at one of the two participating hospitals were included. Patients from site A underwent TS repair (TS group) while patients from site B underwent SA repair (SA group). Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant injuries of the involved knee, penetrating injuries and pre-existing neurological conditions. Clinical outcome was assessed by subjective scores (Lysholm and Tegner Scores, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain), quadriceps isokinetic strength testing, Insall-Salvati Index (ISI), and physical examination. Non-parametrical statistical analysis was conducted using the Mann-Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt; test. Twenty-seven patients were included in the study of which 17 patients (63%) were available for follow-up (SA group: 9, TS group: 8). All patients were male with a mean age of 62.7 (SD: 8.8) and 57.9 (SD: 12.7) years for the SA group and TS group, respectively. The groups did not differ in terms of demographic characteristics. No clinically significant differences were identified between the two groups. There were no re-ruptures in either group. Treatment of quadriceps tendon rupture using suture anchors provides a clinically valid alternative treatment to the gold-standard transosseous suture repair.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521493200000</updated><author><name>Stefan Plesser</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194376</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1623f5ab154:27f88f7:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1521481331028</crawled><fingerprint>b2619fa</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Stefan Plesser, Mohammad Keilani, Gyoergy Vekszler, Timothy Hasenoehrl, Stefano Palma, Martin Reschl, Richard Crevenna, Stefan Hajdu, Harald Kurt Widhalm&lt;/p&gt;

Swarm-founding ‘Warrior wasps’ (&lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt; spp.) are found throughout the tropical regions of South America, are much feared due to their aggressive nest defence and painful sting. There are only five species of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca&lt;/i&gt;, all construct distinctive nests that consist of a single sessile comb built onto the surface of a tree or rock face, which is covered by a ribbed envelope. Although locally common, research into this group is just starting. We studied eight colonies of &lt;i&gt;Synoeca septentrionalis&lt;/i&gt;, a species recently been described from Brazil. A new colony is established by a swarm of 52 to 140 adults that constructs a colony containing around 200 brood cells. The largest colony collected containing 865 adults and over 1400 cells. The number of queen’s present among the eight colonies varied between 3 and 58 and no clear association between colony development and queen number was detected. Workers and queens were morphologically indistinguishably, but differences in their cuticular hydrocarbons were detected, particularly in their (Z)-9-alkenes. The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Eliaber B.

The simple cuticular profile, multiple queens, large size and small number of species makes the ‘Warrior wasps’ an excellent model group for further chemical ecology studies of swarm-founding wasps.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Life history and chemical ecology of the Warrior wasp &amp;lt;i&gt;Synoeca septentrionalis&amp;lt;/i&gt; (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Epiponini)</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01127</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>399</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01127/20180322/images/medium/jp-2018-01127d_0006.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01127</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/xAvEF8UW99g/acs.jpcb.8b01127</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521691200000</published><author><name>Weiwei Zhang, Adri C.

Locomotion of machines and robots operating in rough terrain is strongly influenced by the mechanics of the ground-machine interactions. A rolling wheel in terrain with obstacles is subject to collisional energy losses, which is governed by mechanics comparable to hopping or walking locomotion. Here we investigate the energetic cost associated with overcoming an obstacle for rolling and hopping locomotion, using a simple mechanics model. The model considers collision-based interactions with the ground and the obstacle, without frictional losses, and we quantify, analyse, and compare the sources of energetic costs for three locomotion strategies. Our results show that the energetic advantages of the locomotion strategies are uniquely defined given the moment of inertia and the Froude number associated with the system. We find that hopping outperforms rolling at larger Froude numbers and vice versa. The analysis is further extended for a comparative study with animals. By applying size and inertial properties through an allometric scaling law of hopping and trotting animals to our models, we found that the conditions at which hopping becomes energetically advantageous to rolling roughly corresponds to animals’ preferred gait transition speeds. The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Fabio Giardina</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194375</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16225a89689:4e33a1:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521050228361</crawled><fingerprint>fa5f9151</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Fabio Giardina, Fumiya Iida&lt;/p&gt;

The energetic collision losses as predicted by the model are largely verified experimentally.</description><published>1521061200000</published><title>Collision-based energetic comparison of rolling and hopping over obstacles</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3055.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3055.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/13/E3055.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Plant pathogens can cause serious diseases that impact global agriculture.

Data on general practitioner consultations, prescribed medications, diagnostic tests, specialist consultations, emergency department visits and hospital admissions were collected from national reports.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Using 2016 prices, the estimated annual direct per capita cost of acute gastroenteritis illness was AUD$14.87 (USD$10.71), equating to AUD$20.27 (USD$14.59) per case. The estimated overall economic burden in Australia was AUD$359 million (USD$258 million; AUD$1.5 million per 100,000 people). The major contributors to this cost were hospital admissions (57.1%), emergency department visits (17.7%), and general practitioner consultations (14.0%).

We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Toshihito Fujii</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194812</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ee0e004:40a34b5:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521741783044</crawled><fingerprint>f8b07d22</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Toshihito Fujii, Keisho Hirota, Akihiro Yasoda, Akiko Takizawa, Naomi Morozumi, Ryuichi Nakamura, Takafumi Yotsumoto, Eri Kondo, Yui Yamashita, Yoriko Sakane, Yugo Kanai, Yohei Ueda, Ichiro Yamauchi, Shigeki Yamanaka, Kazumasa Nakao, Koichiro Kuwahara, Toshimasa Jindo, Mayumi Furuya, Tomoji Mashimo, Nobuya Inagaki, Tadao Serikawa, Kazuwa Nakao&lt;/p&gt;
We have previously investigated the physiological role of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) on endochondral bone growth, mainly with mutant mouse models deficient in CNP, and reported that CNP is indispensable for physiological endochondral bone growth in mice. However, the survival rate of CNP knockout (KO) mice fell to as low as about 70% until 10 weeks after birth, and we could not sufficiently analyze the phenotype at the adult stage. Herein, we generated CNP KO rats by using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated genome editing technology. We established two lines of mutant rats completely deficient in CNP (CNP KO rats) that exhibited a phenotype identical to that observed in mice deficient in CNP, namely, a short stature with severely impaired endochondral bone growth. Histological analysis revealed that the width of the growth plate, especially that of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, was markedly lower and the proliferation of growth plate chondrocytes tended to be reduced in CNP KO rats. Notably, CNP KO rats did not have malocclusions and survived for over one year after birth. At 33 weeks of age, CNP KO rats persisted significantly shorter than wild-type rats, with closed growth plates of the femur in all samples, which were not observed in wild-type rats. Histologically, CNP deficiency affected only bones among all body tissues studied. Thus, CNP KO rats survive over one year, and exhibit a deficit in endochondral bone growth and growth retardation throughout life.</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Rats deficient C-type natriuretic peptide suffer from impaired skeletal growth without early death</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01221</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>198</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01221/20180323/images/medium/jp-2018-01221d_0014.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01221</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/9m4t-OT-ALc/acs.jpcb.8b01221</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1521777600000</published><author><name>Jesse G.

I’ve written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoleamine_2,3-dioxygenase&quot;&gt;IDO&lt;/a&gt; inhibitors before, partly in the context of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/10/16/incyte-and-flexus-the-grappling-continues&quot;&gt;odd situation&lt;/a&gt; between Incyte and Flexus, and partly in response to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/06/08/why-did-this-ido-inhibitor-trial-fail&quot;&gt;failed trial&lt;/a&gt; of a compound from NewLink. That last one shook people up a bit, but (as I mentioned in the post) there was still hope for combination of the Incyte drug with Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab). The idea is that IDO inhibition would increase T-cell activity and add to Keytruda’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not the case. The companies have announced that the Phase III trial of this combination in melanoma has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/body-blow-for-incyte-as-merck-partnered-melanoma-trial-bombs&quot;&gt;utterly missed&lt;/a&gt; its endpoints, and that appears to be a massive setback for the whole idea. Add that to the earlier difficulties with other IDO compounds, and the picture is Not Good. Bristol-Myers Squibb has &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt;a big trial going&lt;/a&gt; with their own Opdivo (nivolumab) and their own IDO1 inhibitor (BMS-986205) in melanoma, and this bodes very ill for those results indeed. It has to be noted that they’ve announced what appear to be positive results for that combination&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.bms.com/press-release/bristolmyers/encouraging-response-observed-opdivo-nivolumab-plus-investigational-ido1-&quot;&gt; in other trials&lt;/a&gt;, but hey: Merck and Incyte had what appeared to be decent-looking results early on, too. The feeling when this trial was announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biospace.com/article/confident-bristol-myers-to-launch-a-700-patient-phase-iii-ido-trial-for-melanoma/&quot;&gt;was that&lt;/a&gt; since the company was not waiting for the Merck readout that they must have been pretty confident. But that could also reflect the company’s feeling – not unjustified at all – that they’re locked in a brutal struggle with Merck in this area and had no time to sit around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not only bad news for melanoma patients, for Merck, and (especially) for Incyte. And it’s not only potentially bad news for BMS. It’s potentially bad news for everyone who thought that their understanding of these pathways was good enough to predict success for this trial. One of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/news/next-generation-cancer-drugs-boost-immunotherapy-responses-1.22092&quot;&gt;biggest things going&lt;/a&gt; in immuno-oncology is the combination of the existing agents (PD pathway drugs) with other mechanisms to potentiate their effects and move them into new areas. This trial shows that we don’t know as much about how to do that as we thought we did. So although the IDO-based trials are now very uncertain, this news throws uncertainty around the entire field, whether it goes through that mechanism or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all eyes are on Bristol-Myers Squibb: will their current trial run to completion? I don’t know when they have any interim data reads coming up, but that’s going to be fraught with interest. The expectation at this point is that the trial will fail, for the same reasons – whatever those are – that the Merck/Incyte one just did. But there’s an outside chance that our ignorance of the field is even more profound and that it’ll actually work. &lt;em&gt;(Update: I should emphasize that the binding mode of the BMS compounds is in fact different from the earlier ones – will this make a difference?)&lt;/em&gt; Wouldn’t that be a twist? But you’d have to be brave to bet that way. . .we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Friday brought some very unwelcome news in oncology.

Detection of epistatic interactions still remains a challenge due to the large number of features and relatively small sample size as input, thus leading to the so-called &amp;quot;short fat data&amp;quot; problem. The efficiency of machine learning methods can be increased by limiting the number of input features. Thus, it is very important to perform variable selection before searching for epistasis. Many methods have been evaluated and proposed to perform feature selection, but no single method works best in all scenarios. We demonstrate this by conducting two separate simulation analyses to evaluate the proposed collective feature selection approach. Results: Through our simulation study we propose a collective feature selection approach to select features that are in the &amp;quot;union&amp;quot; of the best performing methods. We explored various parametric, non-parametric, and data mining approaches to perform feature selection. We choose our top performing methods to select the union of the resulting variables based on a user-defined percentage of variants selected from each method to take to downstream analysis. Our simulation analysis shows that non-parametric data mining approaches, such as MDR, may work best under one simulation criteria for the high effect size (penetrance) datasets, while non-parametric methods designed for feature selection, such as Ranger and Gradient boosting, work best under other simulation criteria. Thus, using a collective approach proves to be more beneficial for selecting variables with epistatic effects also in low effect size datasets and different genetic architectures. Following this, we applied our proposed collective feature selection approach to select the top 1% of variables to identify potential interacting variables associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in ~44,000 samples obtained from Geisinger&apos;s MyCode Community Health Initiative (on behalf of DiscovEHR collaboration). Conclusions: In this study, we were able to show that selecting variables using a collective feature selection approach could help in selecting true positive epistatic variables more frequently than applying any single method for feature selection via simulation studies. We were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of collective feature selection along with a comparison of many methods in our simulation analysis. We also applied our method to identify non-linear networks associated with obesity.</content></content><unread>True</unread><author><name>Verma, S.

We analyzed the activity of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in etiolated wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) leaves and at the beginning of their deetiolation. Mn-SOD and three isoforms of Cu/Zn-SODs were identified both in etiolated and greening leaves of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aestivum&lt;/i&gt;. Two Cu/Zn-SODs, denoted as II and III, were found in plastids. The activity of plastidic Cu/Zn-SOD isoforms as well as that of Mn-SOD correlated with cell aging along a monocot leaf, being the highest at leaf tips. Moreover, a high Pchlide content at leaf tips was observed. No correlation between SOD activity and the accumulation of photoactive Pchlide, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. Pchlide bound into ternary Pchlide:Pchlide oxidoreductase:NADPH complexes was found. Cu/Zn-SOD I showed the highest activity at the leaf base. A flash of light induced photoreduction of the photoactive Pchlide to chlorophyllide as well as an increase in all the SODs activity which occurred in a minute time-scale. In the case of seedlings that were deetiolated under continuous light of moderate intensity (100 μmol photons m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), only some fluctuations in plastidic Cu/Zn-SODs and Mn-SOD within the first four hours of greening were noticed.

Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (&lt;i&gt;Triticum aestivum&lt;/i&gt;) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt;, including 26 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPAs&lt;/i&gt;, 15 &lt;i&gt;TaEXPBs&lt;/i&gt; and four &lt;i&gt;TaEXLAs&lt;/i&gt;. No &lt;i&gt;TaEXLB&lt;/i&gt; was identified. Gene expression and sub-expression profiles revealed that most of the &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were expressed either only in root tissues or in multiple organs. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that many &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; were differentially expressed in four different tissues of the two wheat cultivars—the cold-sensitive ‘Chinese Spring (CS)’ and the cold-tolerant ‘Dongnongdongmai 1 (D1)’ cultivars. Our results suggest that the differential expression of &lt;i&gt;TaEXPs&lt;/i&gt; could be related to low-temperature tolerance or sensitivity of different wheat cultivars. Our study expands our knowledge on wheat expansins and sheds new light on the functions of expansins in plant development and stress response.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Jun-Feng Zhang</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195138</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde21:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>dd3ca916</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun-Feng Zhang, Yong-Qing Xu, Jia-Min Dong, Li-Na Peng, Xu Feng, Xu Wang, Fei Li, Yu Miao, Shu-Kuan Yao, Qiao-Qin Zhao, Shan-Shan Feng, Bao-Zhong Hu, Feng-Lan Li&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease, which is defined as having a reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and/or signs of kidney damage (albuminuria), is highly prevalent in Western society and is associated with adverse health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease. This warrants a search for risk factors of lower eGFR and higher albuminuria. Physical activity and sedentary behavior may be such risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To examine associations of physical activity (total, high, low), sedentary time and sedentary behavior patterns (breaks, prolonged bouts, average bout duration) with eGFR and albuminuria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We examined these associations in 2,258 participants of the Maastricht Study (average age 60.1±8.1 years; 51.3% men), who wore an accelerometer 24h/day on 7 consecutive days. Associations with continuous eGFR and categories of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; &amp;lt;15 [reference category], 15-&amp;lt;30, ≥30 mg/24h) were evaluated with linear regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;After adjustment for potential confounders, each extra hour of total physical activity was associated with a more favorable kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.30 (95%CI = 1.46; 3.14)), whereas each extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with a more adverse kidney function (beta&lt;sub&gt;eGFR&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.71 (-1.08; -0.35)). Also, compared to individuals with the lowest levels of total physical activity, individuals with the highest levels had less kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.63 (0.41; 0.96), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.84 (0.53; 1.35). An extra hour of sedentary behavior was associated with more kidney damage (OR&lt;sub&gt;15-&amp;lt;30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.11 (1.01; 1.22), OR&lt;sub&gt;≥30 mg/24h&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.10 (0.99; 1.22)). Further, a highly sedentary pattern was associated with a more adverse kidney function, but no association was seen with kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Physical activity and sedentary behavior were associated with kidney function and kidney damage. Additionally, sedentary behavior patterns were associated with kidney function. Causal studies are required to examine whether this indeed implicates that prevention strategies should focus not only on increasing physical activity, but on reducing sedentary behavior as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Remy J.

We sought to measure the response of cortisol concentrations around a professional tennis match and its association with hydration status and neuromuscular performance. Nine professional male tennis players were tested in a rest day, and 2-week after, during the first match of a professional tournament played in a clay-court. Salivary concentrations of cortisol (SalCC) were measured in a resting day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm), at the match day (9:00 am and 8:00 pm) and immediately before and after the match. Hydration status was assessed before the match (urine specific gravity; USG) while fluid turnover was tracked during the match. Finally, counter movement jump (CMJ) and handgrip isometric strength (HS) were measured before and after the match. SalCC, either in the morning (P = 0.161) and afternoon (P = 0.683) was similar in rest and match days. However, SalCC increased after the match (P = 0.033). Participants started the match hypohydrated (USG = 1.026±0.002) and during the match lost 1.0±0.3% of body weight despite 1.035±0.124 L/h of fluid ingested. CMJ and HS did not change post-match (P = 0.210 and P = 0.881, respectively). Correlations between the elevations in SalCC and dehydration (% BW loss) during the match were significant (r = -0.632; P = 0.034). Professional male tennis players did not show an anticipatory increase in SalCC the day of the match and neither signs of neuromuscular fatigue after it. During the match, the mild dehydration (i.e., &amp;lt;1.5%) was associated with the increases in cortisol levels which suggests that dehydration may be an added stress to be considered.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523048400000</updated><author><name>Álvaro López-Samanes</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1629c0a59fc:3fd072:7c9981b6</id><crawled>1523036346876</crawled><fingerprint>4405404f</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Álvaro López-Samanes, Jesús G.

There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields.

There is a quest for production of soluble protein of high quality for the study of T-cell receptors (TCRs), but expression often results in low yields of functional molecules. In this study, we used an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted periplasmic production system and compared expression of 4 different soluble TCR formats: single-chain TCR (scTCR), two different disulfide-linked TCR (dsTCR) formats, and chimeric Fab (cFab). A stabilized version of scTCR was also included. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of host (XL1-Blue or RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) and the effect of IPTG induction on expression profiles. A celiac disease patient-derived TCR with specificity for gluten was used, and we achieved detectable expression for all formats and variants. We found that expression in RosettaBlue&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; without IPTG induction resulted in the highest periplasmic yields. Moreover, after large-scale expression and protein purification, only the scTCR format was obtained in high yields. Importantly, stability engineering of the scTCR was a prerequisite for obtaining reliable biophysical characterization of the TCR-pMHC interaction. The scTCR format is readily compatible with high-throughput screening approaches that may enable both development of reagents allowing for defined peptide MHC (pMHC) characterization and discovery of potential novel therapeutic leads.</description><published>1523566800000</published><title>Soluble T-cell receptor design influences functional yield in an &amp;lt;i&gt;E&amp;lt;/i&gt;. &amp;lt;i&gt;coli&amp;lt;/i&gt; chaperone-assisted expression system</title></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</originId><visual><width>500</width><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType><height>297</height><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11091/20180406/images/medium/jp-2017-110917_0020.gif</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</href></item></canonical><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/2VbB4xB-AhE/acs.jpcb.7b11091</href></item></alternate><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><published>1522987200000</published><author><name>Leena Aggarwal, Parbati Biswas</name></author><engagement>0</engagement><unread>True</unread><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091</link><id>tjsG48ZWXLDjvLvSvC9UN/E8WMPnLBsSN+EPiWzD0yQ=_1629bd2db85:443ab0:51a16d64</id><crawled>1523032710021</crawled><fingerprint>d221e444</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.7b11091/20180406/images/medium/jp-2017-110917_0020.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.7b11091&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

It seems that faba bean (FB) seeds could be a good protein-energy component in animal feed, but the presence of anti-nutritional substances limits their use as a substitute of soybean meal. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of raw, low-tannin, FB seeds on the gut-bone axis in Ross 308 broilers. One-day old chickens were randomly subjected to one of the 3 dietary treatments: the control group was fed standard diet based on soybean meal and without FB seeds, and two groups were fed 8%/15% and 16%/22% of raw low-tannin FB seeds in the starter and grower, respectively. On the 35&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, hematological and serum biochemical analyses as well histomorphometry of the small intestine and liver tissue and bone mechanical tests were performed. The diet type had no effect on the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio. However, the basal intestinal structures were significantly reduced in birds fed the lower concentration of FB. The enlargement of nerve plexuses was dependent on the concentration used in the diet and, additionally, on the kind of plexus and location in the intestinal tract. The liver was characterized by an increase in non-hepatocytes. There was no influence of the low-tannin FB seeds on most of the analyzed serum parameters in the 35-day-old broiler chickens, except the decreased concentration of total cholesterol and Ca in both experimental groups, triglycerides in group I, and P and uric acid in group II. Furthermore, the increasing concentration of the dietary low-tannin FB did not influence the activities of AspAT (except the group fed the higher amount of FB), ALAT, and LDH. The broiler chickens had no visible leg lesions and no problem in the locomotor function, but the tibiae were lighter mainly in birds fed the higher concentration of FB seeds. Geometric analysis revealed reduction of the cross section area and wall thickness, indicating a decline in the bone midshaft, which influenced the densitometric parameters and the results of mechanical tests. In conclusion, the dietary inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seeds had no negative effects on broiler growth, but disturbed the intestine structure and tibia characteristics. Therefore, all these negative effects necessitate additional examinations before inclusion of raw low-tannin FB seed into poultry diet.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522270800000</updated><author><name>Ewa Tomaszewska</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194969</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626dc1c4c5:6ca424e:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522259838149</crawled><fingerprint>cb1db6ad</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Tomaszewska, Piotr Dobrowolski, Renata Klebaniuk, Małgorzata Kwiecień, Agnieszka Tomczyk-Warunek, Sylwia Szymańczyk, Sylwester Kowalik, Anna Milczarek, Tomasz Blicharski, Siemowit Muszyński&lt;/p&gt;

Cryopreservation of oocytes would serve as an alternative to overcome the limited availability of dromedary camel oocytes and facilitate improvements in IVP techniques in this species. Our goal was to develop a protocol for the vitrification of camel oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage using different cryoprotectant combinations: 20% EG and 20% DMSO (VS1), 25% EG plus 25% DMSO (VS2) or 25% EG and 25% glycerol (VS3) and various cryo-carriers; straws or open pulled-straw (OPS) or solid surface vitrification (SSV); and Cryotop. Viable oocytes were cultured in vitro for 30 h. Matured oocytes were fertilized with epididymal spermatozoa and then cultured in vitro in modified KSOMaa medium for 7 days. Survival and nuclear maturation rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in oocytes exposed to VS3 (44.8% and 34.0%, respectively) than those exposed to VS1 (68.2% and 48.0%, respectively) and VS2 (79.3% and 56.9%, respectively). Although recovery rates were significantly lower (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in SSV and Cryotop vitrified oocytes (66.9% to 71.1%) than those vitrified by straws with VS1 or VS2 solutions (86.3% to 91.0%), survival rates were higher in the SSV and Cryotop groups (90.7% to 94.8%) than in the straw and OPS groups (68.2% to 86.5%). Among vitrified groups, maturation and fertilization rates were the highest in the Cryotop-VS2 group (51.8% and 39.2%, respectively). These values were comparable to those seen in the controls (59.2% and 44.6%, respectively). Cleavage (22.5% to 27.9%), morula (13.2% to 14.5%), and blastocyst (6.4% to 8.5%) rates were significantly higher (&lt;i&gt;P ≤&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) in SSV and Cryotop groups than in straws. No significant differences were observed in these parameters between the Cryotop and control groups. We report for the first time that dromedary oocytes vitrified at the GV-stage have the ability to be matured, fertilized and subsequently develop in vitro to produce blastocysts at frequencies comparable to those obtained using fresh oocytes.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Mohamed Fathi</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194602</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a62c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>4e4e29d9</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohamed Fathi, Adel R.

Most mutations similarly affect both Envs, but the amino-acid preferences of a minority of sites have clearly shifted. These shifted sites usually prefer a specific amino acid in one Env, but tolerate many amino acids in the other.

Therefore, long-range epistasis can unpredictably shift Env&apos;s mutational tolerance during HIV evolution, although the amino-acid preferences of most sites are conserved between moderately diverged viral strains.</content></summary><title>Mapping mutational effects along the evolutionary landscape of HIV envelope</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194508</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194508</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194508</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Suguru Fukushima, Makoto Endo, Yoshihiro Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Fukushi, Tomoya Matsunobu, Ken-ichi Kawaguchi, Nokitaka Setsu, Keiichiro IIda, Nobuhiko Yokoyama, Makoto Nakagawa, Kenichiro Yahiro, Yoshinao Oda, Yukihide Iwamoto, Yasuharu Nakashima&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><visual><width>320</width><contentType>image/png</contentType><height>443</height><url>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194508.g004</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Suguru Fukushima</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194508</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a627:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>6220995d</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Suguru Fukushima, Makoto Endo, Yoshihiro Matsumoto, Jun-ichi Fukushi, Tomoya Matsunobu, Ken-ichi Kawaguchi, Nokitaka Setsu, Keiichiro IIda, Nobuhiko Yokoyama, Makoto Nakagawa, Kenichiro Yahiro, Yoshinao Oda, Yukihide Iwamoto, Yasuharu Nakashima&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Correction: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha is a poor prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor</title></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2734.short?rss=1</originId><link>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2734.short?rss=1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/12/E2734.short?rss=1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Eukaryotic gene regulation is a complex process, often coordinated by the action of tens to hundreds of proteins.

Background &lt;p&gt;Hepatic complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV), including fibrosis and cirrhosis are accelerated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals. Although, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease, this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. These challenges have prompted a search for non-invasive methods for liver fibrosis staging. To this end, we compared serum proteome profiles at different stages of fibrosis in HIV/HCV co- and HCV mono-infected patients using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested.

Five of these candidate biomarkers contributed to both mono- and co-infected subjects.

Background &lt;p&gt;Disturbance of intestinal wound closure leads to insufficient anastomotic healing and is associated with considerable morbidity following colorectal resections. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in regulation of wound closure. Here fluorescence endoscopy was evaluated for assessment of MMP-2/-9 expression during failed intestinal anastomotic healing.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Distal colonic anastomoses were performed as a model for disturbed healing in 36 Balb/c mice. Healing was evaluated endoscopically, macroscopically, and histologically after 1, 3 and 5 days. For detection of MMP-2/-9 expression fluorescence endoscopy (FE) was used following &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;administration of a Cy5.5-labeled MMP-2/-9 specific tracer. FE was complemented by quantification of the fluorescence signal using the MS-FX PRO Optical Imaging System. An overall leakage score was calculated and correlated with the results of FE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;With increasing incidence of anastomotic leakage from POD1 (17%) to POD5 (83%) the uptake of the MMP tracer gradually increased (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), POD1: 17.91 ± 1.251 vs. POD3: 30.56 ± 3.03 vs. POD5: 44.8 ± 4.473, P&amp;lt;0.0001). Mice with defective anastomotic healing showed significantly higher uptake compared to non-defective (SNR: 37.37± 3.63 vs. 26.16± 3.635, P = 0.0369). White light endoscopy and FE allowed evaluation of anastomotic healing and visualization of mucosal MMPs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using FE based detection of MMPs in the anastomosis, an overall positive predictive value of 71.4% and negative predictive value of 66.6% was calculated for detection of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;During disturbed anastomotic healing increased expression of MMP-2/-9 was observed in the anastomotic tissue. Fluorescence endoscopy for detection of MMP-2/-9 during the healing process might be a promising tool for early identification of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521752400000</updated><author><name>Philipp-Alexander Neumann</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194249</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1624ed0ae89:4123915:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521740721801</crawled><fingerprint>68f6ddfd</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Philipp-Alexander Neumann, Vanessa Twardy, Felix Becker, Christiane Geyer, Katrin Schwegmann, Annika Mohr, Andreas Faust, Philipp Lenz, Emile Rijcken&lt;/p&gt;

Using FE based detection of MMPs in the anastomosis, an overall positive predictive value of 71.4% and negative predictive value of 66.6% was calculated for detection of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;During disturbed anastomotic healing increased expression of MMP-2/-9 was observed in the anastomotic tissue. Fluorescence endoscopy for detection of MMP-2/-9 during the healing process might be a promising tool for early identification of anastomotic leakage.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521752400000</published><title>Assessment of MMP-2/-9 expression by fluorescence endoscopy for evaluation of anastomotic healing in a murine model of anastomotic leakage</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194221</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194221</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194221</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Soeno, Tomoharu Mochizuki, Osamu Tanifuji, Hiroshi Koga, Takayuki Murayama, Hiroki Hijikata, Yuki Takahashi, Naoto Endo&lt;/p&gt;
Introduction &lt;p&gt;Instability after total knee arthroplasty is a critical problem.

Mean patient age and follow-up duration were 78.4 years and 32.8 months, respectively. An accelerometer was used to investigate the accelerations along three axes; that is, vertical (VT), mediolateral (ML), and anteroposterior (AP) directions in 3-dimensional (3D) space. The analysis in the stance phase and gait cycle was performed by: (1) root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration and (2) frequency domain analysis using fast Fourier transformation (FFT).

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands.

Climate change has been identified as the primary threat to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems in this century, although there is still much uncertainty about its effects and the degree of vulnerability for different ecosystems to this threat. Here we propose a new methodological approach capable of measuring and mapping the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems at large scales based on their climatic niche. To do this, we used high spatial resolution remote sensing data and ecological niche modeling techniques to calculate and spatialize the resilience of three stable states of ecosystems in South America: forest, savanna, and grassland. Also, we evaluated the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate stress, the likelihood of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions, and their respective adaptive capacities in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that forests, the most productive and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems on the earth, are more vulnerable to climate change than savannas or grasslands. Forests showed less resistance to climate stress and a higher chance of exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions. If this scenario occurs, the forest ecosystems would have less chance of adaptation compared to savannas or grasslands because of their narrow climate niche. Therefore, we can conclude that a possible consolidation of non-analogous climatic conditions would lead to a loss of resilience in the forest ecosystem, significantly increasing the chance of a critical transition event to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover (e.g., savanna or grassland).</description><published>1521493200000</published><title>Measuring resilience and assessing vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change in South America</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195845</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195845</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195845</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;
TDP-43 is an ubiquitous and highly conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in several cellular processes including pre-mRNA splicing, transcription, mRNA stability and transport. Notwithstanding the evidence of TDP-43 involvement in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative disorders (i.e. ALS and FTLD), the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Given the high degree of functional similarity between the human and fly orthologs of TDP-43, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is a simple and useful model to study the pathophysiological role of this protein &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. It has been demonstrated that the depletion of the TDP-43 fly ortholog (tbph) induces deficient locomotive behaviors and reduces life span and anatomical defects at the neuromuscular junction. In this study, using the known binding specificity of TDP-43/tbph for (UG) repeated sequences, we performed a bioinformatic screening for fly genes with at least 6 (TG) repeats in a row within the 3&apos;-UTR regions in order to identify the genes that might be regulated by this factor. Among these genes, we were able to identify RhoGAPp190 as a potential target of the tbph-mediated neurodegeneration. RhoGAPp190 is a negative regulator of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; RhoA, a GTPase protein implicated in the fine modulation of critical cellular processes including axon branch stability and motor axon defasciculation at muscle level and cognitive processes. We were able to demonstrate that the RhoGAPp190 expression is upregulated in a tbph-null fly model, providing evidence that this deregulation is associated to tbph silencing. Our results introduce RhoGAPp190 as a novel potential mediator in the complex scenario of events resulting from &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tbph loss-of-function.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523653200000</updated><author><name>Simona Langellotti</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162c01c45ec:1793632:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1523641501164</crawled><fingerprint>886166b2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Simona Langellotti, Giulia Romano, Fabian Feiguin, Francisco Ernesto Baralle, Maurizio Romano&lt;/p&gt;

The cell lineage of outgrowing thoracic limbs was reconstructed at single-cell resolution with new software called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT). &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; clonal analyses suggested that the early limb primordium becomes subdivided into anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb-bud formation is associated with spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by preferential orientation of cell divisions along the proximal-distal growth axis. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic.</content></summary><title>Multi-view light-sheet imaging and tracking with the MaMuT software reveals the cell lineage of a direct developing arthropod limb</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Sissel Beate Rønning, Mona Elisabeth Pedersen, Ragnhild Stenberg Berg, Bente Kirkhus, Rune Rødbotten&lt;/p&gt;
Skeletal muscle function is highly dependent on the ability to regenerate, however, during ageing or disease, the proliferative capacity is reduced, leading to loss of muscle function. We have previously demonstrated the presence of vitamin K2 in bovine skeletal muscles, but whether vitamin K has a role in muscle regulation and function is unknown. In this study, we used primary bovine skeletal muscle cells, cultured in monolayers &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, to assess a potential effect of vitamin K2 (MK-4) during myogenesis of muscle cells. Cell viability experiments demonstrate that the amount of ATP produced by the cells was unchanged when MK-4 was added, indicating viable cells. Cytotoxicity analysis show that MK-4 reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the media, suggesting that MK-4 was beneficial to the muscle cells. Cell migration, proliferation and differentiation was characterised after MK-4 incubation using wound scratch analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis. Adding MK-4 to the cells led to an increased muscle proliferation, increased gene expression of the myogenic transcription factor &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; as well as increased cell migration. In addition, we observed a reduction in the fusion index and relative gene expression of muscle differentiation markers, with fewer complex myotubes formed in MK-4 stimulated cells compared to control cells, indicating that the MK-4 plays a significant role during the early phases of muscle proliferation. Likewise, we see the same pattern for the relative gene expression of collagen 1A, showing increased gene expression in proliferating cells, and reduced expression in differentiating cells. Our results also suggest that MK-4 incubation affect low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) with a peak in gene expression after 45 min of MK-4 incubation. Altogether, our experiments show that MK-4 has a positive effect on muscle cell migration and proliferation, which are two important steps during early myogenesis.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522875600000</updated><author><name>Sissel Beate Rønning</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195432</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16291c055b2:9d57605:34f43e70</id><crawled>1522863723954</crawled><fingerprint>27a51842</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sissel Beate Rønning, Mona Elisabeth Pedersen, Ragnhild Stenberg Berg, Bente Kirkhus, Rune Rødbotten&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke patients with active cancer frequently experience early neurological deterioration (END); however, the predictors of END are not well studied. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has recently been described as a predictor of poor outcomes in cancer and stroke. However, its role in cancer-related stroke has not been addressed.&lt;/p&gt; Aim &lt;p&gt;We aimed to evaluate the association between the NLR and END in cancer-related stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We included 85 cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer. END was defined as an increase ≥ 4 on the total National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score within 72 hours of admission. The NLR was calculated as the ratio of the absolute neutrophil count to the absolute lymphocyte count. We obtained the NLR during the following three periods: at admission, 1–3 days after admission (D 1–3 NLR) and 4–7 days after admission (D 4–7 NLR).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;END occurred in 15 (18%) of the 85 patients. END was significantly associated with the initial NIHSS score, infarction volume, and the D 1–3 NLR. In multivariate analysis, a higher D 1–3 NLR, measured before END events, remained an independent predictor of END [adjusted odds ratio = 2.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.09–7.08, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032]. In terms of temporal changes in the NLR, the END group showed a tendency toward temporal increase in the NLR at D 1–3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.061) with subsequent decrements in the D 4–7 NLR (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.088), while the non-END group showed no significant changes in the NLR between periods.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study demonstrated that a higher NLR could predict END events in cryptogenic stroke patients with active cancer. However, the results should be confirmed in further large prospective studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521234000000</updated><author><name>Ki-Woong Nam</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194286</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622fe786fb:14849e0:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521222125307</crawled><fingerprint>a912b41b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ki-Woong Nam, Tae Jung Kim, Chi Kyung Kim, Heejung Mo, Han-Yeong Jeong, Min Kyoung Kang, Moon-Ku Han, Sang-Bae Ko, Byung-Woo Yoon&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination can prevent influenza and potentially serious influenza-related complications. Although the single best way to prevent influenza is annual vaccination, everyday preventive actions, including good hygiene, health, dietary, and social habits, might help, too. Several preventive measures are recommended, including: avoiding close contact with people who are sick; staying home when sick; covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing; washing your hands often; avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; and practicing other good health habits like cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, getting plenty of sleep, and drinking plenty of fluids. Understanding public acceptance and current usage of these preventive behaviors can be useful for planning both seasonal and pandemic influenza prevention campaigns. This study estimated the percentage of adults in the United States who reported practicing preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza, and explored associations of reported behaviors with sociodemographic factors.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 2015 National Internet Flu Survey, a nationally representative probability-based Internet panel survey of the non-institutionalized U.S. population ≥18 years. The self-reported behaviors used to avoid catching or spreading influenza were grouped into four and three non-mutually exclusive subgroups, respectively. Weighted proportions were calculated. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted prevalence differences and to determine independent associations between sociodemographic characteristics and preventive behavior subgroups.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Common preventive behaviors reported were: 83.2% wash hands often, 80.0% cover coughs and sneezes, 78.2% stay home if sick with a respiratory illness, 64.4% avoid people sick with a respiratory illness, 51.7% use hand sanitizers, 50.2% get treatment as soon as possible, and 49.8% report getting the influenza vaccination. Race/ethnicity, gender, age, education, income, region, receipt of influenza vaccination, and household size were associated with use of preventive behaviors after controlling for other factors.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Many adults in the United States reported using preventive behaviors to avoid catching or spreading influenza. Though vaccination is the most important tool available to prevent influenza, the addition of preventive behaviors might play an effective role in reducing or slowing transmission of influenza and complement prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522443600000</updated><author><name>Anup Srivastav</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195085</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16277fdbfb1:7a56c52:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522431541169</crawled><fingerprint>c50f433e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anup Srivastav, Tammy A.

Background &lt;p&gt;We evaluated the risk of osteoporosis in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) using a nationwide population-based dataset.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In a cohort study of 986,713 individuals, we selected 2,493 PBC patients who were aged 18 years or older and had been diagnosed with PBC, based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD-9-CM) codes 571.6, during 20002010. The control cohort comprised 9,972 randomly selected, propensity matched patients (by age, gender, and index date), without PBC. Using this adjusted data, a possible association between PBC and the risk of developing osteoporosis was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, osteoporosis was diagnosed in 150 (6.02%) patients in the PBC cohort and in 539 (5.41%) patients in the non-PBC cohort. After adjusting for covariates, osteoporosis risk was found to be 3.333 times greater in the PBC cohort than in the non-PBC cohort when measured over 6 years after PBC diagnosis. Stratification revealed that the use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) had no significance in decreasing the risk of osteoporosis when comparing the PBC cohorts with the non-PBC cohorts (P = 0.124). Additionally, osteoporosis risk was significantly higher in PBC patients with steroid use (aHR: 6.899 vs 3.333). Moreover, when comparing the PBC cohorts to the non-PBC cohorts, the non-cirrhotic patients were prone to osteoporosis at a younger age compared to those in the cirrhotic cohorts. We also found that the associated risk of fractures is only prominent for vertebral and wrist fractures in the PBC cohort compared to that in the non-PBC cohort.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;A significant association exists between PBC and subsequent risk for osteoporosis. Therefore, PBC patients, particularly those treated with steroids, should be evaluated for subsequent risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Chen-Yi Liao</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194418</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ad1c2b5:c7a619:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521136812725</crawled><fingerprint>3569820b</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chen-Yi Liao, Chi-Hsiang Chung, Pauling Chu, Kuang-yu Wei, Tseng-Min Feng, Fu-Huang Lin, Chang-Huei Tsao, Chia-Chao Wu, Wu-Chien Chien&lt;/p&gt;

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence rate and associated factors of co-morbid mental disability among the elderly with motor disability. Data was obtained from the second China National Sample Survey on Disability (CNSSD). 250,752 older adults aged 65 years and above were sampled from 5964 sites, 2980 towns, 734 counties in 31 provinces in China. Descriptive statistics were used for population-weighted numbers and prevalence of co-morbid mental disability by different characteristics. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the association between mental disability, and the factors of co-morbid mental disability among physical disability. Among the elderly with motor disability, 275,607 persons (2.28%, 99% CI: 1.97–2.59) had co-morbid mental disability at the survey time, which was significantly higher than those without motor disability (OR: 2.11, 99% CI: 1.83–2.43). The factors associated with a higher risk of co-morbid mental disability included urban areas (OR: 1.38; 99% CI: 1.04–1.84), east (2.60, 1.76–3.83) or west (1.65, 1.06–2.55) regions, having other co-morbid disabilities (5.93, 4.48–7.85), and having more severe motor disability (Moderate: 1.81, 1.28–2.57; Severe: 2.90, 2.08–4.04; Extremely severe: 4.22, 2.96–6.01). The elderly with motor disability have a high risk of co-morbid mental disability, especially for higher socioeconomic groups. These findings highlight the need of and will be beneficial for implementing more comprehensive prevention and rehabilitation strategies, to prevent and control the emergence and development of multiple disabilities and promote the physical and mental health of the elderly.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Chao Guo</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195555</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d740:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>4c1b2e96</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chao Guo, Ping He, Xinming Song, Gong Chen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Broad scale population estimates of declining species are desired for conservation efforts. However, for many secretive species including large carnivores, such estimates are often difficult. Based on published density estimates obtained through camera trapping, presence/absence data, and globally available predictive variables derived from satellite imagery, we modelled density and occurrence of a large carnivore, the jaguar, across the species’ entire range. We then combined these models in a hierarchical framework to estimate the total population. Our models indicate that potential jaguar density is best predicted by measures of primary productivity, with the highest densities in the most productive tropical habitats and a clear declining gradient with distance from the equator. Jaguar distribution, in contrast, is determined by the combined effects of human impacts and environmental factors: probability of jaguar occurrence increased with forest cover, mean temperature, and annual precipitation and declined with increases in human foot print index and human density. Probability of occurrence was also significantly higher for protected areas than outside of them. We estimated the world’s jaguar population at 173,000 (95% CI: 138,000–208,000) individuals, mostly concentrated in the Amazon Basin; elsewhere, populations tend to be small and fragmented. The high number of jaguars results from the large total area still occupied (almost 9 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low human densities (&amp;lt; 1 person/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) coinciding with high primary productivity in the core area of jaguar range. Our results show the importance of protected areas for jaguar persistence. We conclude that combining modelling of density and distribution can reveal ecological patterns and processes at global scales, can provide robust estimates for use in species assessments, and can guide broad-scale conservation actions.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1522098000000</updated><author><name>Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194719</canonicalUrl><engagement>27</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1626369da18:5adf5f4:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522086304280</crawled><fingerprint>701d1ef2</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Włodzimierz Jędrzejewski, Hugh S.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies are becoming routinely used for the detection of novel and clinically actionable DNA variants at a pangenomic scale. Such analyses are now used in the clinical practice to enable precision medicine. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are still one of the most abundant source of cancer clinical specimen, unfortunately this method of preparation is known to degrade DNA and therefore compromise subsequent analysis. Some studies have reported that variant detection can be performed on FFPE samples sequenced with NGS techniques, but few or none have done an in-depth coverage analysis and compared the influence of different state-of-the-art FFPE DNA extraction kits on the quality of the variant calling. Here, we generated 42 human whole-exome sequencing data sets from fresh-frozen (FF) and FFPE samples. These samples include normal and tumor tissues from two different organs (liver and colon), that we extracted with three different FFPE extraction kits (QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue kit and GeneRead DNA FFPE kit from Qiagen, Maxwell&lt;sup&gt;™&lt;/sup&gt; RSC DNA FFPE Kit from Promega). We determined the rate of concordance of called variants between matched FF and FFPE samples on all common variants (representing at least 86% of the total number of variants for SNVs). The concordance rate is very high between all matched FF / FFPE pairs, with equivalent values for the three kits we analyzed. On the other hand, when looking at the difference between the total number of variants in FF and FFPE, we find a significant variation for the three different FFPE DNA extraction kits. Coverage analysis shows that FFPE samples have less good indicators than FF samples, yet the coverage quality remains above accepted thresholds. We detect limited but statistically significant variations in coverage indicator values between the three FFPE extraction kits. Globally, the GeneRead and QIAamp kits have better variant calling and coverage indicators than the Maxwell kit on the samples used in this study, although this kit performs better on some indicators and has advantages in terms of practical usage. Taken together, our results confirm the potential of FFPE samples analysis for clinical genomic studies, but also indicate that the choice of a FFPE DNA extraction kit should be done with careful testing and analysis beforehand in order to maximize the accuracy of the results.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522962000000</updated><author><name>Eric Bonnet</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195471</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16296f7367c:a69d736:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522951206524</crawled><fingerprint>d03d05e</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eric Bonnet, Marie-Laure Moutet, Céline Baulard, Delphine Bacq-Daian, Florian Sandron, Lilia Mesrob, Bertrand Fin, Marc Delépine, Marie-Ange Palomares, Claire Jubin, Hélène Blanché, Vincent Meyer, Anne Boland, Robert Olaso, Jean-François Deleuze&lt;/p&gt;

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

The anatomical location of adipose tissue might have direct implications for its functionality and risk of cardiovascular disease. Adipose tissue surrounding blood vessels may be thermogenically more active in specific areas of the body, releasing substances that regulate vascular metabolism. In humans, the phenotypic characteristics of adipose tissue surrounding the aorta and the cardiovascular disease risk that it might entail remain largely unknown. Here, we compared thermogenesis-related molecular features of human periaortic adipose tissue samples with those of subcutaneous adipose tissue, obtained by sternotomy from 42 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. To determine the expression of genes related to energy expenditure and the levels of some adipokines, histological examinations, quantitative PCR, and protein expression measurements in adipocyte precursor cells were performed. Periaortic adipocytes were smaller than those from subcutaneous tissue. Moreover, weight gain induced periaortic adipocyte hypertrophy (r = -0.91, p&amp;lt;0.01). Compared to subcutaneous tissue, adiponectin, FABP4, IL-4 and IL-6 was decreased in periaortic adipocytes, whereas FGF21, UCP-1, PGC-1a, CITED1, Omentin and TFAM (Mitochondrial protein) increased. Upon analyzing patients’ clinical conditions, it emerged that the levels of PGC-1a both in male (r = -0.48 p&amp;lt;0.04) and female (r = -0.61, p&amp;lt;0.05) and TFAM in male (r = -0.72, p&amp;lt;0.0008) and female (r = -0.86, p&amp;lt;0.002) decreased significantly with progressive weight gain.

Several multiple-media culture systems have become commercially available for on-farm identification of mastitis-associated pathogens. However, the accuracy of these systems has not been thoroughly and independently validated against microbiological evaluations performed by referral laboratories. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of commercially available culture plates (Accumast, Minnesota Easy System, SSGN and SSGNC Quad plates) to identify pathogens associated with clinical mastitis in dairy cows. Milk samples from the affected quarter with clinical mastitis were aerobically cultured with the on-farm culture systems and by two additional reference laboratories. Agreeing results from both standard laboratories were denoted as the reference standard (RS). Accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) of on-farm plates were determined based on the RS culture of 211 milk samples. All four plate-systems correctly identified ≥ 84.9% of milk samples with no bacterial growth. Accumast had greater values for all overall predictive factors (Ac, Se, Sp, PPV and NPV) and a substantial agreement (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 0.79) with RS. The inter-rater agreements of Minnesota, SSGN, and SSGNC with RS were moderate (0.45 ≤ &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.55). The effectiveness to categorize bacterial colonies at the genus and species was numerically different amongst the commercial plates. Our findings suggest that Accumast was the most accurate on-farm culture system for identification of mastitis-associated pathogens of the four systems included in the analysis.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Jair C.

Background &lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypothermia is widely associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, but remains a pervasive global problem. No studies have examined the impact of hypothermia on outcomes for preterm infants treated with CPAP for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This retrospective analysis assessed the impact of hypothermia on outcomes of 65 neonates diagnosed with RDS and treated with either nasal oxygen (N = 17) or CPAP (N = 48) in a low-resource setting. A classification tree approach was used to develop a model predicting survival for subjects diagnosed with RDS.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Survival to discharge was accurately predicted based on three variables: mean temperature, treatment modality, and mean respiratory rate. None of the 23 neonates with a mean temperature during treatment below 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of treatment modality. Among neonates with a mean temperature exceeding 35.8°C, the survival rate was 100% for the 31 neonates treated with CPAP and 36.4% for the 11 neonates treated with nasal oxygen (p&amp;lt;0.001). For neonates treated with CPAP, outcomes were poor if more than 50% of measured temperatures indicated hypothermia (5.6% survival). In contrast, all 30 neonates treated with CPAP and with more than 50% of temperature measurements above 35.8°C survived to discharge, regardless of initial temperature.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results of our study suggest that successful implementation of CPAP to treat RDS in low-resource settings will require aggressive action to prevent persistent hypothermia. However, our results show that even babies who are initially cold can do well on CPAP with proper management of hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521147600000</updated><author><name>Jennifer Carns</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194144</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1622ac13c17:c43e07:34f43e70</id><crawled>1521135729687</crawled><fingerprint>6ec92a21</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Carns, Kondwani Kawaza, MK Quinn, Yinsen Miao, Rudy Guerra, Elizabeth Molyneux, Maria Oden, Rebecca Richards-Kortum&lt;/p&gt;

However, our results show that even babies who are initially cold can do well on CPAP with proper management of hypothermia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521147600000</published><title>Impact of hypothermia on implementation of CPAP for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in a low-resource setting</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194191</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194191</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194191</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Rangarirai Matima, Katherine Murphy, Naomi S.

Background &lt;p&gt;Current South African health policy for chronic disease management proposes integration of chronic services for better outcomes for chronic conditions; that is based on the Integrated Chronic Disease Model (ICDM).

The study was grounded in the Shippee&apos;s Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) and explored “patient workload” and “patient capacity” to manage chronic conditions. Individual interviews were conducted with 10 adult patient-participants with HIV and type two diabetes (T2D) multimorbidity and 6 healthcare workers who provided health services to these patient-participants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Patient-participants in this study experienced clinic-related workload such as: two separate clinics for HIV and T2D and perceived and experienced power mismatch between patients and healthcare workers. Self-care related workloads were largely around nutritional requirements, pill burden, and stigma. Burden of these demands varied in difficulty among patient-participants due to capacity factors such as: positive attitudes, optimal health literacy, social support and availability of economic resources.

Nitric oxide (NO) regulates neuronal function and thus is critical for tuning neuronal communication. Mechanisms by which NO modulates protein function and interaction include posttranslational modifications (PTMs) such as S-nitrosylation. Importantly, cross signaling between S-nitrosylation and prenylation can have major regulatory potential. However, the exact protein targets and resulting changes in function remain elusive. Here, we interrogated the role of NO-dependent PTMs and farnesylation in synaptic transmission. We found that NO compromises synaptic function at the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in a cGMP-independent manner. NO suppressed release and reduced the size of available vesicle pools, which was reversed by glutathione (GSH) and occluded by genetic up-regulation of GSH-generating and de-nitrosylating glutamate-cysteine-ligase and S-nitroso-glutathione reductase activities. Enhanced nitrergic activity led to S-nitrosylation of the fusion-clamp protein complexin (cpx) and altered its membrane association and interactions with active zone (AZ) and soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein Attachment Protein Receptor (SNARE) proteins. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacological suppression of farnesylation and a nitrosylation mimetic mutant of cpx induced identical physiological and localization phenotypes as caused by NO. Together, our data provide evidence for a novel physiological nitrergic molecular switch involving S-nitrosylation, which reversibly suppresses farnesylation and thereby enhances the net-clamping function of cpx. These data illustrate a new mechanistic signaling pathway by which regulation of farnesylation can fine-tune synaptic release.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6OU2NItN4wI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1523307600000</updated><canonical><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003611</href></item></canonical><engagement>79</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003611</link><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_162ab8ef1f3:ee5f5b:bdf8aaf1</id><crawled>1523296694771</crawled><fingerprint>807ba190</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title></origin><engagementRate>3.95</engagementRate><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan W.

Now, Larry Curtiss and colleagues combine appropriate cathodes and electrolytes and protect the lithium anode to create a lithium–air battery that can operate for hundreds of cycles in a realistic air-like atmosphere. This suggests that future development of these batteries may not be restricted to using purified air streams.</description><visual><width>685</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>399</height><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/nature-static/assets/v1/image-assets/nature25984-f1.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>A lithium–oxygen battery with a long cycle life in an air-like atmosphere</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data management made simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data management made simple, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03071-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Keeping your research data freely available is crucial for open science — and your funding could depend on it.</content></content><published>1520924400000</published><author><name>Quirin Schiermeier</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>50</engagement><unread>False</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1621f7febd6:450a3e:34f43e70</id><crawled>1520946899926</crawled><fingerprint>4ac32159</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data management made simple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data management made simple, Published online: 13 March 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-03071-1&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-03071-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Keeping your research data freely available is crucial for open science — and your funding could depend on it.</description><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-03071-1/d41586-018-03071-1_15518866.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Data management made simple</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</originId><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;
To grow straight and upright, plants need to regulate actively their posture. Gravitropic movement, which occurs when plants modify their growth and curvature to orient their aerial organ against the force of gravity, is a major feature of this postural control. A recent model has shown that graviception and proprioception are sufficient to account for the gravitropic movement and subsequent organ posture demonstrated by a range of species. However, some plants, including wheat coleoptiles, exhibit a stronger regulation of posture than predicted by the model. Here, we performed an extensive kinematics study on wheat coleoptiles during a gravitropic perturbation (tilting) experiment in order to better understand this unexpectedly strong regulation. Close temporal observations of the data revealed that both perturbed and unperturbed coleoptiles showed oscillatory pulses of elongation and curvature variation that propagated from the apex to the base of their aerial organs. In perturbed coleoptiles, we discovered a non-trivial coupling between the oscillatory dynamics of curvature and elongation. The relationship between those oscillations and the postural control of the organ remains unclear, but indicates the presence of a mechanism that is capable of affecting the relationship between elongation rate, differential growth, and curvature.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Renaud Bastien</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194893</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272dcf03c:72eef06:7d6c1c1c</id><crawled>1522345504828</crawled><fingerprint>7ec64172</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Renaud Bastien, Olivia Guayasamin, Stéphane Douady, Bruno Moulia&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Research investigating Whiplash Associated Disorder (WAD) has largely focused on the cervical spine yet symptoms can be widespread. Thoracic spine pain prevalence is reported ~66%; perhaps unsurprising given the forceful stretch/eccentric loading of posterior structures of the spine, and the thoracic spine’s contribution to neck mobility/function. Approximately 50% WAD patients develop chronic pain and disability resulting in high levels of societal and healthcare costs. It is time to look beyond the cervical spine to fully understand anatomical dysfunction in WAD and provide new directions for clinical practice and research.&lt;/p&gt; Purpose &lt;p&gt;To evaluate the scope and nature of dysfunction in the thoracic region in patients with WAD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A systematic review and data synthesis was conducted according to a pre-defined, registered (PROSPERO, CRD42015026983) and published protocol. All forms of observational study were included. A sensitive topic-based search strategy was designed from inception to 1/06/16. Databases, grey literature and registers were searched using a study population terms and key words derived from scoping search. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third reviewer checked for consistency and clarity. Extracted data included summary data: sample size and characteristics, outcomes, and timescales to reflect disorder state. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were tabulated to allow enabling a semi-qualitative comparison and grouped by outcome across studies. Strength of the overall body of evidence was assessed using a modified GRADE.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Thirty eight studies (n&gt;50,000) which were conducted across a range of countries were included. Few authors responded to requests for further data (5 of 9 contacted). Results were reported in the context of overall quality and were presented for measures of pain or dysfunction and presented, where possible, according to WAD severity and time point post injury. Key findings include: 1) high prevalence of thoracic pain (&gt;60%); higher for those with more severe presentations and in the acute stage, 2) low prevalence of chest pain (&amp;lt;22%), 3) evidence of thoracic outlet syndrome, with some association to and involvement of the brachial plexus, 4) muscle dysfunction in the form of heightened activity of the sternocleidomastoid or delayed onset of action of the serratus anterior, 5) high prevalence of myofascial pain and trigger points in the scalene muscles, sternocleidomastoid and mid/lower fibres of trapezius muscle (48–65%), and 6) inconclusive evidence of altered thoracic posture or mobility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports thoracic pain and dysfunction in patients with WAD, involving primarily nerves and muscles. Notwithstanding the low/very low level of evidence from this review, our findings do support a more extensive clinical evaluation of patients presenting with WAD. Additional high quality research is required to further characterise dysfunction across other structures in the thoracic region, including but not limited to the thoracic spine (mobility and posture) and thoracic muscles (stiffness, activation patterns). In turn this may inform the design of clinical trials targeting such dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Nicola R.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virtually every cell of all organisms are involved in processes of intercellular communication through the delivery of their functional mRNAs, proteins and bioactive lipids. We previously demonstrated that mouse embryonic stem cell-released EVs (mESEVs) are able to transfer their content to different target retinal cells, inducing morphological and biochemical changes in them. The main objective of this paper is to characterize EVs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESEVs) and investigate the effects that they have on cultured retinal glial, progenitor Müller cells, which are known to give rise to retinal neurons under specific conditions. This would allow us to establish if hESEVs have a pro-regenerative potential not yet described that could be used in the future for treatment of human retinal degenerative diseases. Initially, we showed that hESEVs are heterogeneous in size, contain mRNAs and proteins involved in the induction and maintenance of stem cell pluripotency and can be internalized by cultured Müller cells. After a single exposure to hESEVs these cells display changes in their gene expression profile, and with multiple exposures they de-differentiate and trans-differentiate into retinal neuronal precursors. hESEVs were then fractionated into microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs), which were characterized by size, specific surface proteins and biochemical/molecular components. We demonstrate that despite the similar internalization of non-fractionated hESEVs, MVs and EXOs by Müller progenitor cells, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, only the release of MVs’ cargo into the cells’ cytoplasm induces specific changes in their levels of pluripotency mRNAs and early retinal proteins. EXOs do not produce any detectable effect. Thus, we conclude that MVs and MVs-containing hESEVs are promising agents that possibly could promote the regeneration of diseased or damaged retinas &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; through inducing glial Müller cells to become replacement neurons.</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521061200000</updated><author><name>Yingqian Peng</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194004</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_162259d7e26:4cf9fd:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1521049501222</crawled><fingerprint>784e5910</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yingqian Peng, Edouard Baulier, Yifeng Ke, Alejandra Young, Novruz B.

Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment, but limited studies focused on the association of socioeconomic status (SES) with hearing loss among adults of working age. This paper aimed to fill this gap among Chinese adults. We obtained data from Ear and Hearing Disorder Survey conducted in four provinces of China in 2014–2015. The survey was based on WHO Ear and Hearing Disorders Survey Protocol and 25,860 adults aged 25 to 59 years were selected in this study. Trained local examiners performed pure tone audiometry to screen people with hearing loss, and those who were screened positively for hearing loss were referred to audiologists to make final diagnosis. SES was measured by occupation, education and income. Results show after adjusting for SES measures and covariates, in urban areas, compared with white-collar workers, blue-collar workers and the unemployed were more likely to have hearing loss, with an odds ratio of 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.3) and 1.2 (95%CI: 1.0, 1.4), respectively. Compared with people with education of senior high school or above, those with junior high school, primary school and illiteracy had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.4, 1.8), 2.1(95%CI: 1.7, 2.5) and 2.6 (95%CI: 1.9, 3.7) times as likely to have hearing loss, respectively. In rural areas, the unemployed had 1.5 (95%CI: 1.0, 2.3) times the risk of hearing loss compared with white-collar workers, and illiterates had 1.6 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.1) times the risk of hearing loss compared with people with education of senior high school or above, after SES variables and covariates were taken into considerations. Income was not significantly associated with hearing loss in urban and rural areas. In conclusion, SES, in the form of occupation and education, was associated with hearing loss among working-aged population, and further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of such association.</content></content><unread>True</unread><updated>1522357200000</updated><author><name>Ping He</name></author><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195227</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16272e7fff1:74dde2c:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1522346229745</crawled><fingerprint>c274997a</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ping He, Yanan Luo, Xiangyang Hu, Rui Gong, Xu Wen, Xiaoying Zheng&lt;/p&gt;

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a prevalent method for gene expression analysis, depending on the stability of the reference genes for data normalization. &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; are popular ornamental plants which are famous for the long flowering period. However, no systematic studies on reference genes in &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; have yet been conducted. In the present study, we selected nine candidate reference genes (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TUB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;18S&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ATC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EIF5A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) and evaluated their expression stability in different tissues during floral development of &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;speciosa&lt;/i&gt; using four algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and, RefFinder). Results showed that &lt;i&gt;RPII&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EF-1α&lt;/i&gt; were the most stably expressed and suitable reference genes for both of &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia&lt;/i&gt; species.

Living animal cells are strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of their environment. To model physiological conditions ultrasoft cell culture substrates, in some instances with elasticity (Young&apos;s modulus) of only 1 kPa, are mandatory. Due to their long shelf life PDMS-based elastomers are a popular choice. However, uncertainty about additives in commercial formulations and difficulties to reach very soft materials limit their use. Here, we produced silicone elastomers from few, chemically defined and commercially available substances. Elastomers exhibited elasticities in the range from 1 kPa to 55 kPa. In detail, a high molecular weight (155 kg/mol), vinyl-terminated linear silicone was crosslinked with a multifunctional (f = 51) crosslinker (a copolymer of dimethyl siloxane and hydrosilane) by a platinum catalyst. The following different strategies towards ultrasoft materials were explored: sparse crosslinking, swelling with inert silicone polymers, and, finally, deliberate introduction of dangling ends into the network (inhibition). Rheological experiments with very low frequencies led to precise viscoelastic characterizations. All strategies enabled tuning of stiffness with the lowest stiffness of ~1 kPa reached by inhibition. This system was also most practical to use. Biocompatibility of materials was tested using primary cortical neurons from rats.

Background &lt;p&gt;Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used as disease modifying treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Rheumatological and dermatological guidelines to prevent MTX-induced adverse events diverge in the number and frequency of blood tests. These differences are not based on evidence indicating a higher risk for patients with psoriasis compared to PsA or rheumatic arthritis (RA). This raises the question if multiple testing increases safety, or results in false positive signals potentially leading to early withdrawal of an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;Compare the effects of MTX monitoring strategies by rheumatologists and dermatologists regarding drug survival, reasons for withdrawal and safety.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective follow-up of all patients diagnosed with psoriasis by dermatologists or PsA by rheumatologists. Included were consecutive patients who started methotrexate (MTX) between 2006 and 2012 and had a scheduled follow-up by dermatologist or rheumatologist. Exclusions were: drug not started after the first prescription or incomplete availability of lab data. Data were extracted from electronic records: start and stop dates and dosing of MTX; treatment with folic acid and dose; reasons for withdrawal of MTX; numbers of blood sampling and types of laboratory tests performed for MTX safety; number of abnormal tests; occurrence of any serious adverse event (SAE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;190 Psoriasis and 196 PsA patients starting methotrexate (MTX) were included. Age and sex were comparable. PsA patients used higher initial and maximum doses of MTX and folic acid, but psoriasis patients had a higher frequency of abnormal laboratory results (0.14 vs 0.03 per treatment month, p&amp;lt;0.001), resulting in a striking difference in withdrawal of MTX for abnormal liver enzymes (15.8% vs 3.6%, p&amp;lt;0.001). In PsA patients MTX was withdrawn less frequently for ineffectiveness (15.8 vs 24.2%, p&amp;lt;0.05) leading to longer drug survival in the first course of treatment (37.4±30 vs 18.8±19.1 months). Repeated courses of MTX were more often prescribed by rheumatologists than by dermatologists. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of SAE (psoriasis 0.0041 vs PsA 0.0038 per treatment month) or death (1.6% vs 2.0%) between these groups. Hospital admissions related to infection were recorded in 6 (3.1%) PsA vs 4 (2.1%) psoriasis patients.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Strict monitoring by dermatologists resulted in more abnormal findings, which reduced drug survival of MTX. The limited monitoring strategy by rheumatologists was not associated with more SAEs. Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><unread>False</unread><updated>1521838800000</updated><author><name>Felien T.

Further research in other populations is needed to confirm whether reduced intensity of monitoring can optimize the use of MTX with sufficient long-term safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description><published>1521838800000</published><title>Dermatological guidelines for monitoring methotrexate treatment reduce drug-survival compared to rheumatological guidelines</title></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04487-5</originId><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04487-5</link><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04487-5</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dive-bombing hummingbirds add a twist to impress mates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dive-bombing hummingbirds add a twist to impress mates, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04487-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04487-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Male hummingbirds increase the volume and pitch of their calls by manipulating their tail feathers.</content></content><published>1523516400000</published><author><name>Jason Bittel</name></author><categories><item><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id><label>journalblitz</label></item></categories><engagement>51</engagement><unread>True</unread><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_162ba9faec1:f26748:9f3b30f2</id><crawled>1523549449921</crawled><fingerprint>e84a5b3</fingerprint><origin><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><title>Nature</title></origin><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dive-bombing hummingbirds add a twist to impress mates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dive-bombing hummingbirds add a twist to impress mates, Published online: 12 April 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04487-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-04487-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Male hummingbirds increase the volume and pitch of their calls by manipulating their tail feathers.</description><engagementRate>0.46</engagementRate><visual><width>1024</width><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType><height>576</height><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-04487-5/d41586-018-04487-5_15603820.jpg</url><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor></visual><title>Dive-bombing hummingbirds add a twist to impress mates</title></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006053</originId><author><name>Huanan Zhang</name></author><alternate><item><type>text/html</type><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/dB94IkLFs70/article</href></item></alternate><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Huanan Zhang, Catherine A.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely applied to discover new cell types by detecting sub-populations in a heterogeneous group of cells. Since scRNA-seq experiments have lower read coverage/tag counts and introduce more technical biases compared to bulk RNA-seq experiments, the limited number of sampled cells combined with the experimental biases and other dataset specific variations presents a challenge to cross-dataset analysis and discovery of relevant biological variations across multiple cell populations. In this paper, we introduce a method of variance-driven multitask clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (scVDMC) that utilizes multiple single-cell populations from biological replicates or different samples. scVDMC clusters single cells in multiple scRNA-seq experiments of similar cell types and markers but varying expression patterns such that the scRNA-seq data are better integrated than typical pooled analyses which only increase the sample size. By controlling the variance among the cell clusters within each dataset and across all the datasets, scVDMC detects cell sub-populations in each individual experiment with shared cell-type markers but varying cluster centers among all the experiments. Applied to two real scRNA-seq datasets with several replicates and one large-scale Drop-seq dataset on three patient samples, scVDMC more accurately detected cell populations and known cell markers than pooled clustering and other recently proposed scRNA-seq clustering methods. In the case study applied to in-house Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) scRNA-seq data, scVDMC revealed several new cell types and unknown markers validated by flow cytometry.
