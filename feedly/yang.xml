To improve short- and long-term outcomes, it is critical to detect at-risk sepsis patients at an early stage. Objective: Our primary goal was to develop machine learning models capable of predicting sepsis using streaming physiological data in real-time. Methods: A dataset consisting of high-frequency physiological data from 1,161 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was analyzed in this IRB-approved retrospective observational cohort study.

In this paper, we define sepsis as meeting the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria in the presence of the suspicion of infection. In addition to the physiological data, we include white blood cell count (WBC) to develop a model that can signal the future occurrence of sepsis. A random forest classifier was trained to discriminate between sepsis and non-sepsis patients using a total of 108 features extracted from 2-hour moving time-windows. The models were trained on 80% of the patients and were tested on the remaining 20% of the patients, for two observational periods of lengths 3 and 6 hours. Results: The models, respectively, resulted in F1 scores of 75% and 69% half-hour before sepsis onset and 79% and 76% ten minutes before sepsis onset. On average, the models were able to predict sepsis 210 minutes (3.5 hours) before the onset.

I thought that when I first did one in 1983, so it must be even more so now, right? You condense liquid ammonia and dissolve a reactive metal in it (sodium or lithium are the usual), giving you a rather unexpected blue solution. That color (weirdly) is due to solvated free electrons, which means that this is one powerful reducing agent. The Birch is famous for being able to knock aromatic rings back down to cycloalkenes, and there are (still) not too many ways to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.8b00891&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt; (from a group at China Agricultural University) describes an ammonia-free (and indeed, amine-free) variant of the reaction – you use commercial sodium dispersion with a crown ether in isopropanol, and you can do it all at zero degrees C, as opposed to the -30 or so you have (at most) in liquid ammonia. Not having to break out the ammonia tank does sort of lower the barrier to running the reaction, it’s true, although I always regarded that as a sign that one was about to do some serious Birching. And condensing ammonia always seems like a magic trick, as the clear liquid just appears on the dry ice cold finger and drips down into the flask. You get that same something-out-of-nothing effect when you do a distillation, of course, but I think it’s the lack of visibility of the source in the case of the ammonia tank that gives it more of a flourish. And of all the gases that I’ve seen condensed on a cold finger, ammonia is definitely the one that I’d rather work with (as opposed to liquified HCN, for example, which I’ve seen once and have no desire to encounter again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another advantage to the Birch is that you typically just let the reaction warm up to get rid of all the ammonia, letting you switch to whatever solvent system you want for the workup. In this case, the reaction is done fairly concentrated (more so than the ammonia ones), and the authors just do an ether/brine extraction without evaporating the isopropanol away. The advantage of that is that the crown ether actually goes into the brine layer, and can be recovered by a second extraction with dichloromethane. This recovery helps, but still is unlikely to make this method of industrial interest (no one wants dichloromethane on that scale). But for bench-scale reactions, this should be pretty convenient. It looks like this reaction does pretty much what the classic Birch does. Of course, sodium in an alcohol solvent is yet another old-school reaction (the Bouveault-Blanc reduction, in the case of esters), and if you don’t add the crown ether, that’s all you’re going to get. But complexing the sodium ions changes the mechanism (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_sphere_electron_transfer&quot;&gt;outer&lt;/a&gt;-sphere versus &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_sphere_electron_transfer&quot;&gt;inner&lt;/a&gt;-sphere), and that gives you Birch products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wonder is if you can make &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_amide&quot;&gt;sodium amide&lt;/a&gt; with this system, if you add some catalytic ferric salt at some point in there. That prep starts out just like a Birch, but the iron sends it down a different path. If so, I might have been able to spare myself &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/12/15/manfred_christl_rides_again_bonus_idiotic_lab_accident_too&quot;&gt;a painful episode&lt;/a&gt; (and I mean that literally) when I first starting doing this sort of chemistry. I’m just glad that there was someone else in the lab to unwind me from the apparatus, is all I can say.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527770875000</published><fingerprint>65aac22c</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13574</link><crawled>1527770933709</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163b63e69cd:301295b:2835af05</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>The Birch reduction – there’s an old-school synthetic transformation from you.

We present a general framework capable of predicting genes with similar tissue-wide expression patterns from activated or repressed TF targets using machine learning to combine TF binding and epigenetic features.

Background &lt;p&gt;Calcifications within the hippocampus were recently described for the first time on computed tomography (CT). These calcifications appeared in patients older than 50 years, the prevalence increases with age and they may be associated with cognitive decline. The aim of this study was to determine the histological basis (the presence, severity and location) of these CT-detected hippocampal calcifications of post-mortem brains.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;CT scans of seven post-mortem brains were scored for the presence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of hippocampal calcification. After this, samples from nine hippocampi (bilateral in two brains, unilateral in five brains) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) to indicate the cytoarchitecture, with Elastica van Gieson to analyse the elastic connective tissue of the vessel walls and with von Kossa for detection of calcium.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In four brains (six hippocampi), calcifications were both found on CT and in corresponding histology. In three brains (three hippocampi), calcifications were absent on CT and corresponding histology. In histology, mild calcifications were located in the tail and severe calcifications involved the tail, body and sometimes the head of the hippocampus. The calcifications co-localised with precapillaries, capillaries and arteries of the molecular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and the Cornu Ammonis 1.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;In this study, calcifications of the hippocampus as seen on CT scans were histologically located in vascular structures of the tail, body and head of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>7837dbbd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197073</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f73:2835af05</id><author><name>Melissa E.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether stopping the effective antibiotic treatment following clinical improvement at Day 7 (Truncated treatment) would be non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 (Continued treatment) in patients with acute pyelonephritis (APN) requiring hospitalization treated with non-fluoroquinolone (non-FQ) antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized adult men and non-pregnant women with culture-confirmed APN were eligible for participation after they had clinically improved following empirical or culture-guided treatment with intravenous non-FQ antibiotic(s). We excluded patients with severe sepsis, abscesses, prostatitis, recurrent or catheter-associated urinary tract infection, or urinary tract obstruction. We randomized eligible patients on Day 7 of effective treatment and assessed them at Weeks 1 and 6 after treatment completion. The primary outcome was retreatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. The prespecified non-inferiority margin was 15%.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Between March 17, 2015 and August 22, 2016, we randomly allocated 54 patients—27 patients in each arm. Twenty-four (44%) patients were male, and 26 (48%) had diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was the most common urinary isolate (47 [87%] patients); 36 (78%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In all, 41 (76%) patients received amikacin-based treatment. At the end of 6 weeks, no patient in the truncated treatment arm required retreatment, whereas 1 patient in the continued treatment arm was retreated. Difference (90% CI) in retreatment was −3.7% (−15.01% to 6.15%). Upper bound of the difference (6.15%) was below the prespecified limit, establishing non-inferiority of truncated treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria at Week 6 was similar between the two arms (3/24 vs. 3/26; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 1.0). Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>f16c7cec</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197302</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b0:2835af05</id><author><name>Pavankumar Rudrabhatla</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Pavankumar Rudrabhatla, Surendran Deepanjali, Jharna Mandal, Rathinam Palamalai Swaminathan, Tamilarasu Kadhiravan&lt;/p&gt;

Patients in the truncated treatment arm had significantly shorter hospital stay (8 [7–10] vs. 14 [14–15] days; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and less antibiotic consumption per patient (8.4 ± 2.8 vs. 17.4 ± 8.3 DDDs; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Stopping the effective non-FQ antibiotics following clinical improvement at Day 7 is non-inferior to continued treatment until Day 14 in selected patients with APN requiring hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt; Trial registration &lt;p&gt;Clinical Trials Registry-India; CTRI/2016/04/006810.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><keywords><item>Botany, Genetics</item></keywords><title>A selfish genetic element confers non-Mendelian inheritance in rice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1130.full</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1130?rss=1</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;Selfish genetic elements are pervasive in eukaryote genomes, but their role remains controversial.

Gene expression in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA sequences at promoter and enhancer regions, whose accessibility for binding by regulatory proteins dictates their specific patterns of activity. Here, we identify the protein Zbtb7a as a factor required for inducible changes in accessibility driven by transcription factors (TFs). We show that Zbtb7a binds to a significant fraction of genomic promoters and enhancers, encompassing many target genes of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) p65 and a variety of other TFs. While Zbtb7a binding is not alone sufficient to directly activate promoters, it is required to enable TF-dependent control of accessibility and normal gene expression. Using p65 as a model TF, we show that Zbtb7a associates with promoters independently of client TF binding. Moreover, the presence of prebound Zbtb7a can specify promoters that are amenable to TF-induced changes in accessibility. Therefore, Zbtb7a represents a widely used promoter factor that transduces signals from other TFs to enable control of accessibility and regulation of gene expression.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0hCOgv8f0oI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>8694d8b7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004526</link><crawled>1527616392783</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163ad084e4f:123fd6:ed160cc3</id><author><name>José Miguel Ramos Pittol</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by José Miguel Ramos Pittol, Agata Oruba, Gerhard Mittler, Simona Saccani, Dominic van Essen&lt;/p&gt;

Glucose and palmitate synergistically stimulate insulin secretion, but chronically elevated they induce apoptotic β-cell death. The glucotoxic effect has been attributed, at least partly, to the upregulation of the oxidative stress marker thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP). Palmitate downregulates TXNIP expression, the functional significance of which is still under debate. This study examines the mechanism and consequence of palmitate-mediated TXNIP regulation in insulin secreting cells. Palmitate (600 μM) reduced TXNIP mRNA levels in isolated human and mouse islets independently of FFAR1/GPR40. Similar effects of palmitate were observed in INS-1E cells and mimicked by other long chain fatty acids. The lowering of TXNIP mRNA was significant already 1 h after addition of palmitate, persisted for 24 h and was directly translated to changes in TXNIP protein. The pharmacological inhibition of palmitate-induced phosphorylation of AMPK, ERK1/2, JNK and PKCα/β by BML-275, PD98059, SP600125 and Gö6976, respectively, did not abolish palmitate-mediated TXNIP downregulation. The effect of palmitate was superimposed by a time-dependent (8 h and 24 h) decline of TXNIP mRNA and protein. This decline correlated with accumulation of secreted insulin into the medium. Accordingly, exogenously added insulin reduced TXNIP mRNA and protein levels, an effect counteracted by the insulin/IGF-1 receptor antagonist linsitinib. The inhibition of PI3K and Akt/PKB increased TXNIP mRNA levels. The histone deacetylase (HDAC1/2/3) inhibitor MS-275 completely abrogated the time-dependent, insulin-mediated reduction of TXNIP, leaving the effect of palmitate unaltered. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion and chronic accentuation of cell death by palmitate occurred independently of TXNIP regulation. On the contrary, palmitate antagonized glucose-augmented ROS production. In conclusion, glucose-induced TXNIP expression is efficiently antagonized by two independent mechanisms, namely via an autocrine activation of insulin/IGF-1 receptors involving HDAC and by palmitate attenuating oxidative stress of β-cells.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>98b8bbb1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198016</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c19:3dd877af</id><author><name>Madhura Panse</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Madhura Panse, Oliver Kluth, Estela Lorza-Gil, Gabriele Kaiser, Eckhard Mühlbauer, Annette Schürmann, Hans-Ulrich Häring, Susanne Ullrich, Felicia Gerst&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has previously been demonstrated to accelerate compensatory lung growth (CLG) in mice and may be a useful therapy for pulmonary hypoplasia. Systemic administration of VEGF can result in side effects such as hypotension and edema. The aim of this study was to explore nasal delivery as a route for intrapulmonary VEGF administration. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily nasal instillation of VEGF at 0.5 mg/kg or isovolumetric saline. Lung volume measurement, morphometric analysis, and protein expression studies were performed on lung tissues harvested on postoperative day (POD) 4. To understand the mechanism by which VEGF accelerates lung growth, proliferation of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was assessed in a co-culture model with lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with and without VEGF (10 ng/mL). The assay was then repeated with a heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) neutralizing antibody ranging from 0.5–50 μg/mL. Compared to control mice, the VEGF-treated group displayed significantly higher lung volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and alveolar count (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) on POD 4. VEGF treatment resulted in increased pulmonary expression of HB-EGF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02). VEGF-treated HMVEC-L increased HBEC proliferation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) while the addition of an HB-EGF neutralizing antibody at 5 and 50 μg/mL abolished this effect (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). These findings demonstrate that nasal delivery of VEGF enhanced CLG.

Thus, joint control by post-transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms is important to maintain epidermal cells in an undifferentiated state.</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Plant Biology</item></keywords><title>Response to comments on “Evolutionary transitions between beneficial and phytopathogenic Rhodococcus challenge disease management”</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35852</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35852</originId><summary><content>Randall et al., 2018 and Vereecke, 2018 have raised concerns about a paper we published (Savory et al., 2017).

&lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; head blight (FHB) mainly caused by &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt;, always brings serious damage to wheat production worldwide. In this study, we found that strain LM2303 had strong antagonist activity against &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;graminearum&lt;/i&gt; and significantly reduced disease severity of FHB with the control efficiency of 72.3% under field conditions. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;velezensis&lt;/i&gt; clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control. The results also provide scientific reference and comparison for other biocontrol strains.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>9ab87bd2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198560</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a8455c:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Liang Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Liang Chen, Junying Heng, Suya Qin, Ke Bian&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic models in disease ecology have historically evaluated vaccination strategies under the assumption that they are implemented homogeneously in space and time. However, this approach fails to formally account for operational and logistical constraints inherent in the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk. Thus, feedback between the dynamic processes of vaccine distribution and transmission might be overlooked. Here, we present a spatially explicit, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Vaccinated model that highlights the density-dependence and spatial constraints of various diffusive strategies of vaccination during an outbreak. The model integrates an agent-based process of disease spread with a partial differential process of vaccination deployment. We characterize the vaccination response in terms of a diffusion rate that describes the distribution of vaccination to the population at risk from a central location. This generates an explicit trade-off between slow diffusion, which concentrates effort near the central location, and fast diffusion, which spreads a fixed vaccination effort thinly over a large area. We use stochastic simulation to identify the optimum vaccination diffusion rate as a function of population density, interaction scale, transmissibility, and vaccine intensity. Our results show that, conditional on a timely response, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size is to distribute vaccination resource at an intermediate rate: fast enough to outpace the epidemic, but slow enough to achieve local herd immunity. If the response is delayed, however, the optimal strategy for minimizing outbreak size changes to a rapidly diffusive distribution of vaccination effort. The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>3268a71e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006161</link><crawled>1527098195054</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1638e253c6e:4bf8e:59412e84</id><author><name>Yun Tao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yun Tao, Katriona Shea, Matthew Ferrari&lt;/p&gt;

The latter may also result in significantly larger outbreaks, thus suggesting a benefit of allocating resources to timely outbreak detection and response.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0yJKQdlBIFk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/WR6bpB4sqgQ/s41467-018-04383-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Distinct epigenetic landscapes underlie the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer subtypes</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04383-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04383-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Distinct epigenetic landscapes underlie the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer subtypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct epigenetic landscapes underlie the pathobiology of pancreatic cancer subtypes, Published online: 17 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04383-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04383-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a complex disease and its underlying epigenomic heterogeneity is not fully understood.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Medio-lateral stability during walking turns relies on the interaction between precise weight shifts of the body and changes in base of support by regulating step width. Although older adults and clinical populations often slow down while turning in order to compensate for balance impairments, little is known about the influence of walking speed on stability during turning.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To compare medio-lateral stability between walking turns and straight walking and to investigate whether walking speed affects medio-lateral stability during turning in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Nineteen older adults walked straight or walked and turned 180° to the right and left at their comfortable speed and at a slow pace. The walking direction was visually cued before they started to walk (preplanned) or while walking straight (unplanned). As a proxy for medio-lateral stability, we calculated the absolute difference between pelvis lateral displacement and the lateral edge of the base of support during straight walking and turning.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Overall, irrespective of turning condition, medio-lateral stability was enhanced during turning as the pelvis was further away from the boundary of the base of support resulting in a greater margin of stability compared to straight walking. Turning at a slow pace hampered medio-lateral stability as demonstrated by pelvis lateral displacement closer to the boundaries of the base of support resulting in reduced margins of stability. The reduction in stability was caused by a narrower step width during slow walking whereas pelvis lateral displacement was unaffected by turning speed.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;In older adults, medio-lateral stability was augmented during turning compared to straight walking, whereas turning at a slow pace hampered medio-lateral stability. These findings provide insights into the postural strategies used by older adults in order to adapt to the postural challenges of turning and straight walking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>1f6bc101</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198455</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bcd:3dd877af</id><author><name>David Conradsson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by David Conradsson, Caroline Paquette, Erika Franzén&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. AMPK activation reduces glucose levels in animal models of type 2 diabetes by increasing glucose uptake in skeletal muscles and reducing hepatic glucose production. Furthermore, AMPK activation ameliorates hepatic steatosis in animal models. For the clinical development of AMPK activators it is essential to have a reliable target engagement marker for appropriate dose finding and to support proof of clinical principle. While the activation of AMPK by quantification of the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt; in target tissues can be assessed pre-clinically, this is not feasible in clinical studies. Therefore, we attempted to identify and translate a peripheral target engagement biomarker downstream of AMPK activation for clinical use in blood samples.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;For pharmacological activation of AMPK, two AMPK activators were synthesized (compound 1 and 2). A compound with structural similarities but no pharmacological effect on AMPK phosphorylation was synthesized as negative control (compound 3). Whole blood from healthy volunteers was incubated with an AMPK activator for up to 6 hours and mRNA sequencing was performed. Additionally, human PBMCs were isolated to evaluate Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in Western blots. In order to enable identification of translatable biomarker candidates, blood samples from HanWistar rats treated for two weeks with an AMPK activator were also subjected to mRNA sequencing. Furthermore, concentration-response curves for four biomarker candidates were recorded in human blood samples using Nanostring nCounter technology. Finally, ZDF rats were treated with increasing doses of compound 2 for five weeks to investigate the glucose-lowering efficacy. To investigate changes of mRNA expression of two selected biomarker candidates in this ZDF rat study, qRT-PCR was performed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Pharmacological activation of AMPK in human PBMCs revealed an increase in Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK, confirming target engagement in these blood cells. RNA sequencing of human blood samples identified 608 deregulated genes after AMPK activation. Additionally, AMPK activation led to deregulation of 367 genes in whole blood from HanWistar rats which mapped to the respective human genes. 22 genes out of the intersection of genes deregulated in both species are proposed as potential translatable target engagement biomarker candidates. The most prominent genes were transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB, osteoactivin), calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGLYRP1) and Ras homolog gene family, member B (RHOB). Specificity for AMPK was shown by testing inactive compound 3 in HanWistar rats. The exposure-effect relationship for GPNMB was investigated in a subchronic study in diabetic ZDF rats. GPNMB showed a dose-dependent up-regulation both acutely and after subchronic dosing. GPNMB up-regulation correlated with an increased Thr&lt;sup&gt;172&lt;/sup&gt;-phosphorylation of AMPK in liver and quadriceps muscle in rats.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;GPNMB has been identified as a translatable target engagement biomarker for use in clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>7d9b7cd3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197849</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd78:3dd877af</id><author><name>Rolf Grempler</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rolf Grempler, Michael Wolff, Eric Simon, Ramona Schmid, Claudia Eisele, Kathrin Rieber, Elke Fischer, Sonja Mettel, Ogsen Gabrielyan, Denis Delic, Gerd Luippold, Norbert Redeman&lt;/p&gt;

Laterality can be observed as side biases in locomotory behaviour which, in the horse, manifest &lt;i&gt;inter alia&lt;/i&gt; as forelimb preferences, most notably in the gallop. The current study investigated possible leading-leg preferences at the population and individual level in Thoroughbred racehorses (n = 2095) making halt-to-gallop transitions. Videos of flat races in the UK (n = 350) were studied to record, for each horse, the lead-leg preference of the initial stride into gallop from the starting stalls. Races from clockwise (C) and anti-clockwise (AC) tracks were chosen alternately at random to ensure equal representation. Course direction, horse age and sex, position relative to the inside rail and finishing position were also noted. On C courses, the left/right ratio was 1.15, which represents a significant bias to the left (z = –2.29, p = 0.022), while on AC courses it was 0.92 (z = 0.51, p = 0.610). In both course directions, there was no significant difference between winning horses that led with the left leading leg versus the right (C courses, z = –1.32, p = 0.19 and AC courses, z = –0.74, p = 0.46). Of the 2,095 horses studied 51.26% led with their L fore and 48.74% with their R, with no statistically significant difference (z = -1.16, p = 0.25). Therefore, there was no evidence of a population level motor laterality. Additionally, 22 male and 22 female horses were randomly chosen for repeated measures of leading leg preference. A laterality index was calculated for each of the 44 horses studied using the repeated measures: 22 exhibited right laterality (of which two were statistically significant) and 21 exhibited left laterality (eight being statistically significant); one horse was ambilateral. Using these data, left lateralized horses were more strongly lateralized on an individual level than the right lateralized horses (t = 2.28, p = 0.03, DF = 34) and mares were more left lateralized than males (t = 2.4, p = 0.03, DF = 19).</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>7c37afd3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198545</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b3:2835af05</id><author><name>Paulette Cully</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Paulette Cully, Brian Nielsen, Bryony Lancaster, Jessica Martin, Paul McGreevy&lt;/p&gt;

Using these data, left lateralized horses were more strongly lateralized on an individual level than the right lateralized horses (t = 2.28, p = 0.03, DF = 34) and mares were more left lateralized than males (t = 2.4, p = 0.03, DF = 19).</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/K2m7caRpHKo/acs.biochem.8b00393</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] An Efficient Method for the Expression and Purification of Aß(M1–42)</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00393/20180524/images/medium/bi-2018-003932_0006.gif</url><height>250</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00393/20180524/images/medium/bi-2018-003932_0006.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00393&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Use of the pediatric emergency department (PED) for low-acuity health issues is a growing problem, contributing to overcrowding, longer waits and higher health system costs. This study examines an educational initiative aimed at reducing low-acuity PED visits. The initiative, implemented at an academic pediatric hospital, saw PED physicians share a pamphlet with caregivers to educate them about appropriate PED use and alternatives. Despite early impacts, the initiative was not sustained. This study analyzes the barriers and enablers to physician participation in the initiative, and offers strategies to improve implementation and sustainability of similar future initiatives.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-two PED physicians were invited to participate in a semi-structured individual interview assessing their views about low-acuity visits, their pamphlet use, barriers and enablers to pamphlet use, and the initiative’s potential for reducing low-acuity visits. Suggestions were solicited for improving the initiative and reducing low-acuity visits. Constant comparative method was used during analysis. Codes were developed inductively and iteratively, then grouped according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Efforts to ensure study credibility included seeking participant feedback on the findings.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-three PED physicians were interviewed (55%). Barriers and enablers for pamphlet use were identified and grouped according to five of the 14 TDF domains: social/professional role and identity; beliefs about consequences; environmental context and resources; social influences; and emotions.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The TDF provided an effective approach to identify the key elements influencing physician participation in the educational initiative.

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673).

Computing the local dynamic stability using accelerometer data from inertial sensors has recently been proposed as a gait measure which may be able to identify elderly people at fall risk. However, the assumptions supporting this potential were concluded as most studies implement a retrospective fall history observation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of local dynamic stability for fall risk prediction in a cohort of subjects over the age of 60 years using a prospective fall occurrence observation. A total of 131 elderly subjects voluntarily participated in this study. The baseline measurement included gait stability assessment using inertial sensors and clinical examination by Tinetti Balance Assessment Tool. After the baseline measurement, subjects were observed for a period of one year for fall occurrence. Our results demonstrated poor multiple falls predictive ability of trunk local dynamic stability (AUC = 0.673). The predictive ability improved when the local dynamic stability was combined with clinical measures, a combination of trunk medial-lateral local dynamic stability and Tinetti total score being the best predictor (AUC = 0.755). Together, the present findings suggest that the medial-lateral local dynamic stability during gait combined with a clinical score is a potential fall risk assessment measure in the elderly population.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335737v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Identification of biological mechanisms by semantic classifier systems [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/31/335737</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/335737v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>The interpretability of a classification model is one of its most essential characteristics.

Methods: Original gene expression profiles were obtained from the GSE64318 and GSE46602 datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We conducted differential screens of the expression of genes (DEGs) between two groups using the R software limma package. The interactions between the differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted and merged with the target genes. Co-expression of the miRNAs, lncRNAs and mRNAs were selected to construct the mRNA-miRNA and -lncRNA interaction networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed for the DEGs. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed, and the transcription factors were annotated. The expression of hub genes in the TCGA datasets was verified to improve the reliability of our analysis. Results: The results demonstrated that 60 miRNAs, 1578 mRNAs and 61 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. The mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA networks were composed of 5 miRNA nodes, 13 lncRNA nodes, and 45 mRNA nodes. The DEGs were mainly enriched in the nuclei and cytoplasm and were involved in the regulation of transcription, related to sequence-specific DNA binding, and participated in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. These pathways are related to cancer and focal adhesion signalling pathways. Furthermore, we found that 5 miRNAs, 6 lncRNAs, 6 mRNAs and 2 TFs play important regulatory roles in the interaction network. The expression levels of EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1, DLG4, TGFBR1 and KIT were significantly different between PCa and normal prostate tissue. Conclusion: Based on the current study, large-scale effects of interrelated mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and TFs were revealed and a model for predicting the mechanism of PCa was provided. This study provides new insight for the exploration of the molecular mechanisms of PCa and valuable clues for further research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>832b00dd</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/323543v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1526501297912</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1636a914ef8:44b6aff:2835af05</id><author><name>Li, S.-L.</name></author><description>Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) causes a common male urinary system malignant tumour, and the molecular mechanisms of PCa remain poorly understood.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest in history. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) operated five Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Sierra Leone and Liberia. This paper explores how future infectious disease outbreak facilities in resource-limited settings can be planned, organized, and managed by analyzing data collected on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and infection prevention control (IPC) protocols.&lt;/p&gt; Design/Methodology/Approach &lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study by analyzing WASH/IPC activity data routinely recorded on paper forms or white boards at ETUs during the outbreak and later merged into a database from two IMC-run ETUs in Sierra Leone between December 2014 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The IMC WASH/IPC database contains data from over 369 days. Our results highlight parameters key to designing and maintaining an ETU. High concentration chlorine solution usage was highly correlated with both daily patient occupancy and high-risk zone staff entries; low concentration chlorine usage was less well explained by these measures. There is high demand for laundering and disinfecting of personal protective equipment (PPE) on a daily basis and approximately 1 (0–4) piece of PPE is damaged each day.&lt;/p&gt; Research limitations/Implications &lt;p&gt;Lack of standardization in the type and format of data collected at ETUs made constructing the WASH/IPC database difficult.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains.

Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jctcce/~3/HMD1ziYVU8U/acs.jctc.8b00402</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Correction to Definition of Free O–H Groups of Water at the Air–Water Interface</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>560</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/templates/jsp/_style2/_achs/images/CoverImages_2by1Scaled/jctcce.png</url><height>283</height><contentType>image/png; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00402</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00402</originId><summary><content>&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00402&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Objective &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to identify potential CpG site(s) or DNA methylation pattern(s) in the pseudo α-globin 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene), the gene which locates in α-thalassemia-1 deletion mutation, to differentiate plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;DNA methylation profiles of placenta and peripheral blood from the MethBase database were compared to screen differentially methylated regions. This region was confirmed the differential by methylation-sensitive high resolution melt (MS-HRM) analysis. The differential region was used to compare DNA methylation profile of plasma DNA between pregnant and non-pregnant women by bisulfite amplicon sequencing in three levels: overall, individual CpG sites and individual molecules (DNA methylation patterns).&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Using MethBase data, four consecutive CpG sites in the &lt;i&gt;HBAP1&lt;/i&gt; gene were identified as regions of differential DNA methylation between placenta and peripheral blood. The confirmation by MS-HRM showed the differential DNA methylation profile between the placenta and plasma from non-pregnant women. The comparison of DNA methylation profiles between the plasma of pregnant and non-pregnant women showed that, in the overall levels of the four CpG sites, DNA methylation of pregnant women was detected at lower levels than non-pregnant women. In the individual CpG site level, only the second CpG site showed differential DNA methylation between the groups. In the DNA methylation pattern level, there was no strongly significant differences in DNA methylation patterns between the pregnant and non-pregnant groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our result demonstrated that, in the plasma from pregnant women, only one of the four CpG sites displays a decrease in DNA methylation compared with non-pregnant women. It indicates that this CpG site might be useful for determining the presence or absence of fetal wild-type α-globin gene cluster allele in maternal plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>5ae0903e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198165</link><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ed:3dd877af</id><author><name>Tanapat Pangeson</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tanapat Pangeson, Torpong Sanguansermsri, Khwanruedee Mahingsa, Phanchana Sanguansermsri&lt;/p&gt;

Limited information is available on influenza virus sequence drift between transmission events. In countries with high HIV burdens, like South Africa, the direct and indirect effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events may be of public health concern. To this end, we measured hemagglutinin sequence diversity between influenza transmission events using data and specimens from a study investigating household transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza viruses in 2 peri-urban communities in South Africa during the 2013 influenza season. Thirty index cases and 107 of 110 eligible household contacts were enrolled into the study, 47% (14/30) demonstrating intra-household laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission. In this study 35 partial hemagglutinin gene sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing from 11 index cases (sampled at enrolment only) and 16 secondary cases (8 cases sampled at 1 and 8 cases sampled at 2 time-points). Viral sequence identities confirmed matched influenza transmission pairs within the 11 households with corresponding sequenced index and secondary cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 different influenza viral lineages in the 14 households. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains were shown to be genetically distinct between the 2 communities (from distinct geographic regions), which was not observed for the influenza A(H3N2) strains. Intra-host/intra-household influenza A(H3N2) sequence drift was identified in 2 households. The first was a synonymous mutation between the index case and a household contact, and the second a non-synonymous mutation between 2 serial samples taken at days 0 and 4 post enrolment from an HIV-infected secondary case. Limited inter-household sequence diversity was observed as highlighted by sharing of the same influenza strain between different households within each community. The limited intra-household sequence drift is in line with previous studies also using Sanger sequencing, corroborating the presence of strict selective bottlenecks that limit sequence variance. We were not able to directly ascertain the effect of HIV on influenza sequence drift between transmission events.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>6787ac65</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198101</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e3a:2835af05</id><author><name>Ziyaad Valley-Omar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ziyaad Valley-Omar, Preetha Iyengar, Claire von Mollendorf, Stefano Tempia, Alexandra Moerdyk, Orienka Hellferscee, Neil Martinson, Meredith McMorrow, Ebrahim Variava, Katlego Masonoke, Adam L.

Most children and adolescents with chronic health conditions have impaired health-related quality of life and are at high risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8–18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/ physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was a health-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>16ce3b2a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198402</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b953:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Neuza Silva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Silva, Monika Bullinger, Helena Moreira, Maria Cristina Canavarro, Carlos Carona&lt;/p&gt;

Mast cells, in addition to endocrine cells and neurons, are typical secretory cells. Their function in allergic inflammation is to secrete inflammatory mediators from secretory vesicles. Intracellular synthesized inflammatory mediators are transported by vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) to vesicles where they are stored. After stimulation, the contents of the secretory vesicles are released via exocytosis. This study established a high throughput imaging screening system to monitor the functions of secretory vesicles in mast cells, including molecular uptake via VMAT2 and the exocytotic process, by using a novel fluorescent probe, FFN206, which was developed as a VMAT2 substrate. After loading with FFN206, the rapid uptake of FFN206 was observed and secretory vesicles in mouse bone marrow derived mast cells and a cultured mast cell line were clearly visualized. FFN206 uptake by secretory vesicles was time-dependent and was blocked by reserpine. Furthermore, exocytotic trafficking was monitored dynamically by real-time high-throughput fluorescence quantitation. In the present study, we verified the application of FFN206 for the monitoring of functional vesicles. This high-throughput screening system may benefit instinctive drug evaluation.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>b99e2aa8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198785</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0be:2835af05</id><author><name>Takeshi Kiyoi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takeshi Kiyoi, Shuang Liu, Muhammad Novrizal Abdi Sahid, Masachika Shudou, Kazutaka Maeyama, Masaki Mogi&lt;/p&gt;

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>f5b2ecb4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005130</link><crawled>1526492659509</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a0d7f35:4c6cd:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Shinsuke Ohnuki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, effective treatment of infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; has become challenging due to the ability of the bacterium to acquire or up-regulate antimicrobial resistance determinants. Two component signal transduction systems are known to regulate expression of virulence factors including multidrug efflux pumps. Here, we investigated the role of the AdeRS two component signal transduction system in regulating the AdeAB efflux system, determined whether AdeA and/or AdeB can individually confer antimicrobial resistance, and explored the interplay between pentamidine resistance and growth conditions in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 17978. Results identified that deletion of &lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; affected resistance towards chlorhexidine and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, two previously defined AdeABC substrates, and also identified an 8-fold decrease in resistance to pentamidine. Examination of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt;, Δ&lt;i&gt;adeB&lt;/i&gt; and Δ&lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; cells augmented results seen for Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; and identified a set of dicationic AdeAB substrates. RNA-sequencing of Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt; revealed transcription of 290 genes were ≥2-fold altered compared to the wildtype. Pentamidine shock significantly increased &lt;i&gt;adeA&lt;/i&gt; expression in the wildtype, but decreased it in Δ&lt;i&gt;adeRS&lt;/i&gt;, implying that AdeRS activates &lt;i&gt;adeAB&lt;/i&gt; transcription in ATCC 17978. Investigation under multiple growth conditions, including the use of Biolog phenotypic microarrays, revealed resistance to pentamidine in ATCC 17978 and mutants could be altered by bioavailability of iron or utilization of different carbon sources. In conclusion, the results of this study provide evidence that AdeAB in ATCC 17978 can confer intrinsic resistance to a subset of dicationic compounds and in particular, resistance to pentamidine can be significantly altered depending on the growth conditions.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>3be07326</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197412</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f81:2835af05</id><author><name>Felise G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3.

Background &lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke unless treated with an anticoagulant. Detecting AF can be difficult because AF is often paroxysmal and asymptomatic. The aims of this study were to develop a screening model to detect AF in a primary healthcare setting and to initiate oral anticoagulant therapy in high-risk patients to prevent stroke.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a cross-sectional study. All 70- to 74-year-old individuals registered at a single primary healthcare center in Stockholm were invited to participate in AF screening upon visiting the center during a ten-month period. Those who did not have contact with the center during this period were invited to participate by letter. Thirty-second intermittent ECG recordings were made twice a day using a handheld Zenicor device over a 2-week period in participants without AF. Oral anticoagulant therapy was offered to patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;Of the 415 eligible individuals, a total of 324 (78.1%) patients participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 72 years, 52.2% were female, and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score of the participants was 3. In the target population, 34 (8.2%) individuals had previously diagnosed AF. Among participants without previously known AF, 16 (5.5%) cases of AF were detected. The final AF prevalence in the target population was 12%. Oral anticoagulant therapy was successfully initiated in 88% of these patients with newly detected AF.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The AF screening project exhibited a high participation rate and resulted in a high rate of newly discovered AF; of these newly diagnosed patients, 88% could be treated with an oral anticoagulant.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><origin><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>eLife: latest articles</title></origin><keywords><item>Cancer Biology</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><title>PAX3-FOXO1 transgenic zebrafish models identify HES3 as a mediator of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/33800</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.33800</originId><summary><content>Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a pediatric soft-tissue sarcoma caused by &lt;i&gt;PAX3/7-FOXO1&lt;/i&gt; fusion oncogenes and is characterized by impaired skeletal muscle development.

Extensive antibiotic use over the years has led to the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB). Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health since for many infections antibiotic treatment is no longer effective. Hospitals are focal points for ARB spread. Antibiotic use in hospitals exerts selective pressure, accelerating the spread of ARB. We used an agent-based model to explore the impact of antibiotics on the transmission dynamics and to examine the potential of stewardship interventions in limiting ARB spread in a hospital. Agents in the model consist of patients and health care workers (HCW). The transmission of ARB occurs through contacts between patients and HCW and between adjacent patients. In the model, antibiotic use affects the risk of transmission by increasing the vulnerability of susceptible patients and the contagiousness of colonized patients who are treated with antibiotics. The model shows that increasing the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics increases the rate of acquisition non-linearly. The effect of antibiotics on the spread of resistance depends on characteristics of the antibiotic agent and the density of antibiotic use. Antibiotic&apos;s impact on the spread increases when the bacterial strain is more transmissible, and decreases as resistance prevalence rises. The individual risk for acquiring ARB increases in parallel with antibiotic density both for patients treated and not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment in the hospital setting plays an important role in determining the spread of resistance. Interventions to limit antibiotic use have the potential to reduce the spread of resistance, mainly by choosing an agent with a favorable profile in terms of its impact on patient&apos;s vulnerability and contagiousness. Methods to measure these impacts of antibiotics should be developed, standardized, and incorporated into drug development programs and approval packages.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>239aec5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197111</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a2198:93d646dc</id><author><name>Jonatan Almagor</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jonatan Almagor, Elizabeth Temkin, Itzhak Benenson, Noga Fallach, Yehuda Carmeli, on behalf of the DRIVE-AB consortium &lt;/p&gt;

Sperm activation is a fascinating example of cell differentiation, in which immotile spermatids undergo a rapid and dramatic transition to become mature, motile sperm. Because the sperm nucleus is transcriptionally silent, this transition does not involve transcriptional changes. Although &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a leading model for studies of sperm activation, the mechanisms by which signaling pathways induce this transformation remain poorly characterized. Here we show that a conserved transmembrane zinc transporter, ZIPT-7.1, regulates the induction of sperm activation in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis&lt;/i&gt; nematodes. The &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; mutant hermaphrodites cannot self-fertilize, and males reproduce poorly, because mutant spermatids are defective in responding to activating signals. The &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; gene is expressed in the germ line and functions in germ cells to promote sperm activation. When expressed in mammalian cells, ZIPT-7.1 mediates zinc transport with high specificity and is predominantly located on internal membranes. Finally, genetic epistasis places &lt;i&gt;zipt-7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt; at the end of the &lt;i&gt;spe-8&lt;/i&gt; sperm activation pathway, and ZIPT-7.1 binds SPE-4, a presenilin that regulates sperm activation. Based on these results, we propose a new model for sperm activation. In spermatids, inactive ZIPT-7.1 is localized to the membranous organelles, which contain higher levels of zinc than the cytoplasm. When sperm activation is triggered, ZIPT-7.1 activity increases, releasing zinc from internal stores. The resulting increase in cytoplasmic zinc promotes the phenotypic changes characteristic of activation. Thus, zinc signaling is a key step in the signal transduction process that mediates sperm activation, and we have identified a zinc transporter that is central to this activation process.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3pYNyUReKxQ&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>1a09622b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005069</link><crawled>1528393384581</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163db584285:4559e9:a96d255</id><author><name>Yanmei Zhao</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yanmei Zhao, Chieh-Hsiang Tan, Amber Krauchunas, Andrea Scharf, Nicholas Dietrich, Kurt Warnhoff, Zhiheng Yuan, Marina Druzhinina, Sam Guoping Gu, Long Miao, Andrew Singson, Ronald E.

A biophysical model that captures molecular homeostatic control of ions at the perisynaptic cradle (PsC) is of fundamental importance for understanding the interplay between astroglial and neuronal compartments. In this paper, we develop a multi-compartmental mathematical model which proposes a novel mechanism whereby the flow of cations in thin processes is restricted due to negatively charged membrane lipids which result in the formation of deep potential wells near the dipole heads. These wells restrict the flow of cations to “hopping” between adjacent wells as they transverse the process, and this surface retention of cations will be shown to give rise to the formation of potassium (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) microdomains at the PsC. We further propose that a K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microdomain formed at the PsC, provides the driving force for the return of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to the extracellular space for uptake by the neurone, thereby preventing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undershoot. A slow decay of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was also observed in our simulation after a period of glutamate stimulation which is in strong agreement with experimental observations. The pathological implications of microdomain formation during neuronal excitation are also discussed.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2aFUE1uepp4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>fc29cc46</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006151</link><crawled>1526665788268</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163745f3b6c:131f:910a81bb</id><author><name>Kevin Breslin</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin Breslin, John Joseph Wade, KongFatt Wong-Lin, Jim Harkin, Bronac Flanagan, Harm Van Zalinge, Steve Hall, Matthew Walker, Alexei Verkhratsky, Liam McDaid&lt;/p&gt;

These precious data enable large-scale computational analyses to gain biological insights. However, it remains a challenge to mine the data efficiently for knowledge discovery. The heterogeneity of these data makes it difficult to consistently integrate them, slowing down the process of biological discovery. We introduce a data processing paradigm to identify key factors in biological processes via systematic collection of gene expression datasets, primary analysis of data, and evaluation of consistent signals. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our paradigm was applied to epidermal development and identified many genes that play a potential role in this process. Besides the known epidermal development genes, a substantial proportion of the identified genes are still not supported by gain- or loss-of-function studies, yielding many novel genes for future studies.

These precious data enable large-scale computational analyses to gain biological insights. However, it remains a challenge to mine the data efficiently for knowledge discovery. The heterogeneity of these data makes it difficult to consistently integrate them, slowing down the process of biological discovery. We introduce a data processing paradigm to identify key factors in biological processes via systematic collection of gene expression datasets, primary analysis of data, and evaluation of consistent signals. To demonstrate its effectiveness, our paradigm was applied to epidermal development and identified many genes that play a potential role in this process. Besides the known epidermal development genes, a substantial proportion of the identified genes are still not supported by gain- or loss-of-function studies, yielding many novel genes for future studies. Among them, we selected a top gene for loss-of-function experimental validation and confirmed its function in epidermal differentiation, proving the ability of this paradigm to identify new factors in biological processes. In addition, this paradigm revealed many key genes in cold-induced thermogenesis using data from cold-challenged tissues, demonstrating its generalizability. This paradigm can lead to fruitful results for studying molecular mechanisms in an era of explosive accumulation of publicly available biological data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0163-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/neuro/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/neuro/current_issue/rss/</streamId><title>Nature Neuroscience</title></origin><title>Altered hippocampal replay is associated with memory impairment in mice heterozygous for the Scn2a gene</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0163-8</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Altered hippocampal replay is associated with memory impairment in mice heterozygous for the &lt;i&gt;Scn2a&lt;/i&gt; gene&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altered hippocampal replay is associated with memory impairment in mice heterozygous for the &amp;lt;i&gt;Scn2a&amp;lt;/i&gt; gene, Published online: 04 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0163-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0163-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Middleton et al. demonstrate that heterozygous deletion of the frequently mutated Scn2a gene leads to reduced performance in spatial memory tasks in mice, resulting from incomplete sequence reactivation during hippocampal sharp wave ripples.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>133</engagement><published>1528095600000</published><fingerprint>375e4cfc</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0163-8</link><crawled>1528125406329</crawled><id>JUbwWNliu7Sm8PueN2buh+BNLFKUBchfN+/RNZY+mb0=_163cb5f3c79:4da486f:2835af05</id><author><name>Steven J.

The Wiener polarity number (which, nowadays, known as the Wiener polarity index and usually denoted by &lt;i&gt;W&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) was devised by the chemist Harold Wiener, for predicting the boiling points of alkanes.

This study describes differences in species richness and composition of the assemblages of galling insects and their host plants at different spatial scales. Sampling was conducted along altitudinal gradients composed of &lt;i&gt;campos rupestres&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;campos de altitude&lt;/i&gt; of two mountain complexes in southeastern Brazil: Espinhaço Range and Mantiqueira Range. The following hypotheses were tested: i) local and regional richness of host plants and galling insects are positively correlated; ii) beta diversity is the most important component of regional diversity of host plants and galling insects; and iii) Turnover is the main mechanism driving beta diversity of both host plants and galling insects. Local richness of galling insects and host plants increased with increasing regional richness of species, suggesting a pattern of unsaturated communities. The additive partition of regional richness (γ) into local and beta components shows that local richnesses (α) of species of galling insects and host plants are low relative to regional richness; the beta (β) component incorporates most of the regional richness. The multi-scale analysis of additive partitioning showed similar patterns for galling insects and host plants with the local component (α) incorporated a small part of regional richness. Beta diversity of galling insects and host plants were mainly the result of turnover, with little contribution from nesting. Although the species composition of galling insects and host plant species varied among sample sites, mountains and even mountain ranges, local richness remained relatively low. In this way, the addition of local habitats with different landscapes substantially affects regional richness. Each mountain contributes fundamentally to the composition of regional diversity of galling insects and host plants, and so the design of future conservation strategies should incorporate multiple scales.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>34588b48</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0195565</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7217:2835af05</id><author><name>Marcel Serra Coelho</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marcel Serra Coelho, Marco Antônio Alves Carneiro, Cristina Alves Branco, Rafael Augusto Xavier Borges, Geraldo Wilson Fernandes&lt;/p&gt;

Adult height is determined by both genetic characteristics and environmental factors in early life. Although previous studies have suggested that adult height is associated with risk of mortality, comprehensive associations between height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the Japanese population are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the associations between adult height and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Japanese men and women in a prospective cohort study. We investigated 107,794 participants (50,755 men and 57,039 women) aged 40 to 69 years who responded to the baseline questionnaire in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Participants were classified by quartile of adult height obtained from a self-reported questionnaire in men (&amp;lt;160cm, 160-163cm, 164-167cm, ≥168cm) and women (&amp;lt;149cm, 149-151cm, 152-155cm, ≥156cm). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from all-cause, cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other cause mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. During follow-up, 12,320 men and 7,030 women died. Taller adult height was associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.83 (0.69–0.99); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.95 (0.90–0.99)) and respiratory disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.69–1.03); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.87–0.97)), but was also associated with increased risk for overall cancer mortality (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;160cm vs. ≥168cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.17 (1.07–1.28); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 1.04 (1.01–1.07)) in men. Taller adult height was also associated with decreased risk for mortality from cerebrovascular disease (HR &lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;149cm vs. ≥156cm&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.66–1.05); HR &lt;sub&gt;for 5-cm increment&lt;/sub&gt; (95% CI) = 0.92 (0.86–0.99)) in women.

Aiming at the design of an allosteric modulator of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)–Immunoglobulin G (IgG) interaction, we developed a new methodology including NMR fragment screening, X-ray crystallography, and magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR at 100 kHz after sedimentation, exploiting very fast spinning of the nondeuterated soluble 42 kDa receptor construct to obtain resolved proton-detected 2D and 3D NMR spectra. FcRn plays a crucial role in regulation of IgG and serum albumin catabolism. It is a clinically validated drug target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases caused by pathogenic antibodies via the inhibition of its interaction with IgG. We herein present the discovery of a small molecule that binds into a conserved cavity of the heterodimeric, extracellular domain composed of an α-chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) (FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;, 373 residues). X-ray crystallography was used alongside NMR at 100 kHz MAS with sedimented soluble protein to explore possibilities for refining the compound as an allosteric modulator. Proton-detected MAS NMR experiments on fully protonated [&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C,&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N]-labeled FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt; yielded ligand-induced chemical-shift perturbations (CSPs) for residues in the binding pocket and allosteric changes close to the interface of the two receptor heterodimers present in the asymmetric unit as well as potentially in the albumin interaction site. X-ray structures with and without ligand suggest the need for an optimized ligand to displace the α-chain with respect to β2m, both of which participate in the FcRn&lt;sub&gt;ECD&lt;/sub&gt;–IgG interaction site. Our investigation establishes a method to characterize structurally small molecule binding to nondeuterated large proteins by NMR, even in their glycosylated form, which may prove highly valuable for structure-based drug discovery campaigns.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/S9m_cYKMaok&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>33</engagement><published>1526936400000</published><updated>1526936400000</updated><fingerprint>d28e90d7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006192</link><crawled>1526924854361</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16383d04459:d57e1:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Daniel Stöppler</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Stöppler, Alex Macpherson, Susanne Smith-Penzel, Nicolas Basse, Fabien Lecomte, Hervé Deboves, Richard D.

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women).

The objective of this study was to explore trajectories of lung function decline with age in the general population, and to study the effect of sociodemographic and life style related risk factors, in particular smoking and BMI. For this purpose, we used data from the Doetinchem Cohort Study (DCS) of men and women, selected randomly from the general population and aged 20–59 years at inclusion in 1987–1991, and followed until the present. Participants in the DCS are assessed every five years. Spirometry has been performed as part of this assessment from 1994 onwards. Participants were included in this study if spirometric measurement of FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which in this study was the main parameter of interest, was acceptable and reproducible on at least one measurement round, leading to the inclusion of 5727 individuals (3008 females). Statistical analysis revealed three typical trajectories. The majority of participants followed a trajectory that closely adhered to the Global Lung Initiative Reference values (94.9% of men and 96.4% of women). Two other trajectories showed a more pronounced decline. Smoking and the presence of respiratory complaints were the best predictors of a trajectory with stronger decline. A greater BMI over the follow-up period was associated with a more unfavorable FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; course both in men (β = -0.027 (SD = 0.002); P &amp;lt; 0.001) and in women (β = -0.008 (SD = 0.001); P &amp;lt; 0.001). Smokers at baseline who quit the habit during follow-up, showed smaller decline in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in comparison to persistent smokers, independent of BMI change (In men β = -0.074 (SD = 0.020); P &amp;lt; 0.001. In women β = -0.277 (SD = 0.068); P &amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, three typical trajectories of age-related FEV1 decline could be distinguished. Change in the lifestyle related risk factors, BMI and smoking, significantly impact aging-related decline of lung function. Identifying deviant trajectories may help in early recognition of those at risk of a diagnosis of lung disease later in life.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5289.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Symbiotic root infections in Medicago truncatula require remorin-mediated receptor stabilization in membrane nanodomains [Plant Biology]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5289</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/20.cover-source.jpg?itok=tq2Qj6AB</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5289.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Plant cell infection is tightly controlled by cell surface receptor-like kinases (RLKs).

Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are studied in many fields of science. However, various noise and varied USV patterns in observed signals make complete automatic analysis difficult. We improve several methods to reduce noise, detect USV calls and automatically cluster USV calls. After reduction of noise and detection of USV calls, we consider USV calls as functional data and characterize them as USV functions with B-spline basis functions. For discontinuous USV calls, breakpoints in the USV functions are defined using multiple knots in the construction of the B-spline basis functions, and a hierarchical method is used to cluster the USV functions by shape. We finally show the performance of the proposed methods with USV data recorded for laboratory mice.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>b9423df6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196834</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed1:2835af05</id><author><name>Xiaoling Dou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaoling Dou, Shingo Shirahata, Hiroki Sugimoto&lt;/p&gt;

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>7</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>ba42822c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006100</link><crawled>1525887570014</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_16345fc905e:1b81bb5:abeb7260</id><author><name>Gonçalo M.

Influenza A virus infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and currently available prevention and treatment methods are suboptimal. In recent years, genome-wide investigations have revealed numerous host factors that are required for influenza to successfully complete its life cycle. However, only a select, small number of influenza strains were evaluated using this platform, and there was considerable variation in the genes identified across different investigations. In an effort to develop a universally efficacious therapeutic strategy with limited potential for the emergence of resistance, this study was performed to investigate the effect of combinatorial RNA interference (RNAi) on inhibiting the replication of diverse influenza A virus subtypes and strains. Candidate genes were selected for targeting based on the results of multiple previous independent genome-wide studies. The effect of single and combinatorial RNAi on the replication of 12 diverse influenza A viruses, including three strains isolated from birds and one strain isolated from seals, was then evaluated in primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. After excluding overly toxic siRNA, two siRNA combinations were identified that reduced mean viral replication by greater than 79 percent in all mammalian strains, and greater than 68 percent in all avian strains. Host-directed combinatorial RNAi effectively prevents growth of a broad range of influenza virus strains &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and is a potential therapeutic candidate for further development and future &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>90d9f16</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197246</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c721f:2835af05</id><author><name>Michael A.

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of work in this paper on the synthetic procedures, both to prepare these compounds and to investigate their chemistry. What it tells you is that (as you would have figured) that C-to-Si is a nontrivial switch in the fume hood, because the chemistries involved can be quite different. For instance, that first core on the list does N-alkylation and N-acylation reactions just fine, but when you try to do metal-catalyzed N-C couplings on it, things go to pieces (protodesilylation and other decomposition reactions). Protodesilylation in general was something that had to be looked out for, with attention paid to solvent choice and temperature in the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another theme that comes up several times is that the nitrogens, when exposed to base, can be significantly more prone to oxidative side reactions than expected (even fairly simple reductive amination reactions had to be performed under inert atmosphere, although they were successful then). Metalation reactions were also tricky. Some of them worked just fine and reacted as expected with a range of electrophiles, while others would work with some partners but not others. But some of them just fell apart immediately on attempts to form the anions (such as C2 of the second compound on the list shown), and the only way to find that out was to try them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the group was able to prepare an impressive range of functionalized derivatives of these cores, almost all of which are shots into unknown territory. How, then, do such compounds behave? Their cLogP values are almost invariably higher than their carbon analogs, but as usual when you move into unusual structure space, it would be interesting to have some experimental values to make sure that that some of this just isn’t a problem with the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the Si and C matched pairs in assays, there seems to be no difference in P-gp transporter behavior &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, for starters. There was a slight trend towards more instability against CYP enzymes, but this wasn’t universal (and was also species-dependent, with the rat enzymes being more vigorous. (That’s often the case; rats have a reputation for having more strongly oxidizing liver enzymes, which I’ve always attributed to their rather broad definitions of suitable food). Inhibition of these enzymes didn’t show much of a trend one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second compound on the list above and its carbon analog were compared in rat PK experiments as well (oral and i.v.) Intravenous behavior was fairly similar – the Si compound had slightly higher clearance and slightly higher volume of distribution. As for p.o. dosing, the Si compound is significantly more bioavailable, although it has a lower Cmax. Overall AUC was pretty much the same, though. And even though it had greater instability to the rat enzymes, it had a twofold great half-life&lt;em&gt; in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, which makes you think plasma protein binding. So this is only one point, but taken with the other Si compounds in the literature, it seems as if they fall inside the normal range of variation that you see with all-carbon compounds – there’s nothing intrinsically weird about them from a pharmacokinetic/metabolic standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings up what I mentioned in my past last year, though: perhaps it would be better for silicon-containing drugs if there &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; something unusual about them. Admittedly, that could also be “unusually bad”, but overall, it’s harder to make the case for moving to silicon if the effects of doing so are (a) not huge and (b) not all that predictable. You’re already in that zone with carbon analogs, most likely, so why bother? The paper itself has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This lack of success in the pharmaceutical industry may be attributed to two key factors: (1) an absence of general and accessible synthetic methods for the construction of appropriately functionalized silicon-containing molecules and (2) ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon, of which the “carbon/silicon switch” is the most common. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that second point is what we’re talking about. “Ineffective approaches to the utilization of silicon”, from another angle, means “lack of a good reason to use it at all”. If some effective uses for it can be found – and they may well be out there, who knows? – then things will change. But not until then. If the late-stage silicon switch doesn’t necessarily get you anything, it’s true that you’re going to have to look earlier (good activity in a silicon-containing compound that isn’t replicated by its carbon analog), and this work is an attempt to provide a host of new Si-containing chemical matter towards that end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would go a long way to answering the overall question would be if someone were to produce a library of (say) ten or twenty thousand diverse silicon-containing drug-like structures and their exact carbon analogs, and do some high-throughput screening campaigns (variously targeted, cellular, and phenotypic) to see how they behave. But no one’s going to go to that trouble just yet, for just the reasons described (an absence of ways to make such things and an absence of compelling reasons to make them). The chicken and egg question remains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>2</engagement><published>1526478652000</published><fingerprint>8b621f1c</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13543</link><crawled>1526478848246</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_163693ac0f6:40525e3:3dd877af</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>Here’s an update to a post from last year about silicon in drug-like molecules.

The finding of power law scaling in neural recordings lends support to the hypothesis of critical brain dynamics. However, power laws are not unique to critical systems and can arise from alternative mechanisms. Here, we investigate whether a common time-varying external drive to a set of Poisson units can give rise to neuronal avalanches and exhibit apparent criticality. To this end, we analytically derive the avalanche size and duration distributions, as well as additional measures, first for homogeneous Poisson activity, and then for slowly varying inhomogeneous Poisson activity. We show that homogeneous Poisson activity cannot give rise to power law distributions. Inhomogeneous activity can also not generate perfect power laws, but it can exhibit approximate power laws with cutoffs that are comparable to those typically observed in experiments. The mechanism of generating apparent criticality by time-varying external fields, forces or input may generalize to many other systems like dynamics of swarms, diseases or extinction cascades. Here, we illustrate the analytically derived effects for spike recordings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and discuss approaches to distinguish true from apparent criticality. Ultimately, this requires causal interventions, which allow separating internal system properties from externally imposed ones.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lb6BJ4HT6MU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>83c88968</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006081</link><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df5:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Viola Priesemann</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viola Priesemann, Oren Shriki&lt;/p&gt;

Bloodstream infection (BSI) and associated sepsis represent a major source of mortality in industrialized countries. Prompt treatment with targeted antibiotics affects both the financial impact and the clinical outcome of BSI: every hour gained in initiating the correct antimicrobial therapy significantly increases the probability of patient survival. However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>ae2ccf24</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197436</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8c:93d646dc</id><author><name>Martina Tassinari</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Martina Tassinari, Silvia Zannoli, Patrizia Farabegoli, Maria Federica Pedna, Anna Pierro, Antonio Mastroianni, Riccardo Fontan, Luciano Luongo, Giuseppe Sarnataro, Elisa Menegatti, Assunta Caruso, Vittorio Sambri&lt;/p&gt;

However, the current standard-of-care, which depends on blood culture-based diagnosis, are often unable to provide such a fast response. Fast and sensitive molecular techniques for the detection of sepsis-related pathogens from primary blood samples are strongly needed. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay, a PCR/ESI-MS-based technology for the early diagnosis of bloodstream infections from primary blood samples in critical patients. This evaluation has been performed by comparison with the traditional culture-based methods. The study was performed on a total of 300 prospective whole blood specimens obtained from patients suspected of sepsis, admitted to enrolling ER units from The Greater Romagna Area. The overall concordance between the two techniques was of 86%, with a calculated sensitivity of 76% and an assay specificity of 90%. The clinical significance of discrepant results was evaluated reviewing the patients’ clinical records and the results of additional relevant microbiological tests. The data here obtained support the ability of the IRIDICA BAC BSI Assay to identify a broad range of bacteria directly from primary whole blood samples, within eight hours. This might allow a timely administration of a suitable treatment.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/QB9VuzHJXfc/s41598-018-25808-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Author Correction: High-temperature operation of electrical injection type-II (GaIn)As/Ga(AsSb)/(GaIn)As “W”-quantum well lasers emitting at 1.3 µm</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25808-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25808-8</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: High-temperature operation of electrical injection type-II (GaIn)As/Ga(AsSb)/(GaIn)As “W”-quantum well lasers emitting at 1.3 µm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: High-temperature operation of electrical injection type-II (GaIn)As/Ga(AsSb)/(GaIn)As “W”-quantum well lasers emitting at 1.3 µm, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25808-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-25808-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: High-temperature operation of electrical injection type-II (GaIn)As/Ga(AsSb)/(GaIn)As “W”-quantum well lasers emitting at 1.3 µm&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/QB9VuzHJXfc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526367600000</published><fingerprint>ceac0352</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25808-8</link><crawled>1526337345875</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_16360cb9953:32b4bf5:3dd877af</id><author><name>C.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have gained an increased share over warfarin for prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease. We studied DOAC adoption across providers and medical specialties.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of Medicare Part D public use files (PUF), 2013 to 2015. We summarized prescription data for claims and drug payment, stratified by drug class, specialty and calendar year. We treated DOAC claims as a count outcome and explored patterns of expansion across prescribers via a truncated negative binomial regression. We described dispersion and spread in DOAC prescribing, across hospital referral regions (HRRs), including the p90/p10 ratios, and the median absolute deviation from the median.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 2015 part D PUF, oral anticoagulant claims have climbed to approximately 24.4 million with a payment cost of approximately $3.3 billion. DOAC claims comprised 31.0% of oral anticoagulant claims, showing a relative increase of approximately 127% compared to 2013. The upper decile of prescribers accounted for half of the oral anticoagulant prescriptions and the resulting cost. The median cost per DOAC claim in 2015 was $367.4 (interquartile range 323.9 to 445.9), as opposed to $12.3 (interquartile range 9.2 to 16.5) for warfarin. The median cost per standardized (30-day supply) prescription was $317.0 (interquartile range 303.8 to 324.3) and $8.0 (6.7 to 9.8) for DOACs and warfarin, respectively. DOAC adoption differs by specialty. Cardiologists, cardiac electrophysiologists and orthopedics had the highest predicted DOAC share per 100 claims (53.8, 72.9 and 71.5, respectively in 2015); nephrologists, family practitioners and geriatricians the lowest (22.3, 21.5 and 20.7, respectively in 2015). The p90/p10 ratio and the median absolute deviation from the median varied across HRRs and correlated positively with the prevalence of stroke and atrial fibrillation in the Medicare population.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;DOACs have been increasing their share year-over-year, but adoption varies across specialties. In prevalent areas for stroke and atrial fibrillation, prescription dispersion magnifies, and this may signify a rapid adoption by top providers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>41a9c218</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198674</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:6683356:3dd877af</id><author><name>Panayiotis D.

The new method, which is best referred to as Iterative Ornstein–Zernike Inversion, represents a generalization and an improvement of the established Iterative Boltzmann Inversion technique (Reith, Pütz and Müller‐Plathe, J. Comput. Chem. 2003, 24, 1624). Our modification of Iterative Boltzmann Inversion consists of replacing the potential of mean force as an approximant for the pair potential with another, generally more accurate approximant that is based on a trial bridge function in the Ornstein–Zernike integral equation formalism. As an input, the new method requires the particle pair correlations both in real space and in the Fourier conjugate wavenumber space. An accelerated iteration method is included in the discussion, by which the required number of iterations can be greatly reduced below that of the simple Picard iteration that underlies most common implementations of Iterative Boltzmann Inversion. Comprehensive tests with various pair potentials show that the new method generally surpasses the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion method in terms of reliability of the numerical solution for the particle pair potential. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25225?af=R</originId><content><content>Journal of Computational Chemistry, EarlyView. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1525067179000</published><fingerprint>f5d60d73</fingerprint><link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com:443/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.25225?af=R</link><crawled>1527237924938</crawled><id>6wY2EtDmLbeMr9WopopAzS1SKiHs2ogsOuunEriW7zs=_1639679584a:2569b6:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>MarcoHeinen</name></author><description>An iterative Monte Carlo inversion method for the calculation of particle pair potentials from given particle pair correlations is proposed in this article.

Our modification of Iterative Boltzmann Inversion consists of replacing the potential of mean force as an approximant for the pair potential with another, generally more accurate approximant that is based on a trial bridge function in the Ornstein–Zernike integral equation formalism. As an input, the new method requires the particle pair correlations both in real space and in the Fourier conjugate wavenumber space. An accelerated iteration method is included in the discussion, by which the required number of iterations can be greatly reduced below that of the simple Picard iteration that underlies most common implementations of Iterative Boltzmann Inversion. Comprehensive tests with various pair potentials show that the new method generally surpasses the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion method in terms of reliability of the numerical solution for the particle pair potential. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Choroidal thickness in normal Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Zeeshan Akhtar, Pukhraj Rishi, Ramasubramanian Srikanth, Ekta Rishi, Muna Bhende, Rajiv Raman&lt;/p&gt;
Aim &lt;p&gt;To determine choroidal thickness in healthy Indian subjects using Swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this prospective, observational, cross-sectional study; healthy Indian subjects (n = 230) with no history of ocular and/or systemic disorders were enrolled in the study. Choroidal thickness was measured for 230 eyes using SS-OCT. Subjects were divided into six age groups. Main outcome measures were subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular choroidal thickness (MCT) up to 3 mm at 500-micron interval from the fovea was measured in eight different quadrants.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The mean SFCT was 307±79 μm and mean MCT was 285±75 μm. No difference in the choroidal thickness was found among genders. Mean SFCT of the different age groups was 327±68 μm (12–18 years), 364±70 μm (18.1–30 years), 321±78 μm (30.1–40 years), 304±79 μm (40.1–50 years), 283±69 μm (50.1–60 years) and 262±72μm (above 60 years; p &amp;lt;0.001; One way ANOVA). Mean macular choroidal thickness was 305±60 μm, 342±61 μm, 306±72 μm, 282±79 μm, 261±66 μm, 238±68μm respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001; one way ANOVA). A significant weak negative correlation was found between age with SFCT (r = -0.368, p&amp;lt;0.001) and MCT (r = -0.40, p&amp;lt;0.001). No significant correlation was found with refractive error, axial length and ocular perfusion pressure.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study showed that mean SFCT and MCT was 307±79μm and 285±75 μm, respectively, among healthy Indian subjects. Mean CT was found to decrease with age, although there was no difference in CT between genders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>aed4f5f4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197457</link><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c58:3dd877af</id><author><name>Zeeshan Akhtar</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zeeshan Akhtar, Pukhraj Rishi, Ramasubramanian Srikanth, Ekta Rishi, Muna Bhende, Rajiv Raman&lt;/p&gt;

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>3acd22b1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197290</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:155915d:93d646dc</id><author><name>Sojung Yi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts.

Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Limited studies have investigated geographic accessibility to a nearby community pharmacy for elderly which is an essential determinant of the access to medications and pharmacy services. This research identified pharmacy deserts and investigated availability of different types of community pharmacies and their services for elderly enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The state of Pennsylvania in the US was used as a case to demonstrate the geographic accessibility to community pharmacy and services for elderly enrolled in SPAP. The locations of community pharmacies and households of elderly enrolled in SPAP were derived from Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly programs’ database. The street addresses were geocoded and the distance to a nearby community pharmacy was calculated for study sample using the haversine formula. The demographic and geographic data were aggregated to Census Tracts and pharmacy deserts were identified using the predefined criteria. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to determine whether there are statistical differences in the socio-demographic profiles and distribution of different types of community pharmacies and their services in pharmacy deserts and non-deserts. This research used hot spot analyses at county level to identify clusters of pharmacy deserts, areas with high concentration of different racial/ethnic groups and clusters of high densities of chain and independent pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The Spatial analysis revealed that 39% and 61% Census Tracts in Pennsylvania were pharmacy deserts and non-deserts respectively (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Pharmacy deserts were found to have significantly more females, married and white elderly and fewer blacks and Hispanics compared to pharmacy non-deserts. Pharmacy deserts had significantly fewer chain and independent pharmacies and less delivery and 24-hour services in pharmacies than pharmacy non-deserts. Hot spot analyses showed that clusters of pharmacy deserts were more concentrated in southcentral, northwest and northeast regions of the state which represent rural areas and overlapped with clusters of high concentration of white individuals.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that urban-rural inequality, racial/ethnic disparity and differences in availability of pharmacies and their services exist between pharmacy deserts and non-deserts.

Background &lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy (EM) characteristics of the urothelium in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and their association with clinical condition are unclear.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Ten IC/BPS patients who were admitted for hydrodistention and 5 patients with stress urinary incontinence (control patients) were enrolled. All patients provided detailed clinical histories and underwent urodynamic studies. Cystoscopic bladder biopsies were obtained and processed for transmission EM (TEM) and scanning EM (SEM). The severity of the urothelium findings was graded on a 4-point scale (0: none, 1: mild, 2: moderate, and 3: severe). The EM findings between IC/BPS and control patients were compared; the results were analyzed using the chi-square test.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared with the urothelium of control patients, the urothelium of IC/BPS patients had more severe defects of the urothelial cell layers and integrity of umbrella cells in TEM (p = 0.045 and 0.01, respectively). In SEM, umbrella cell pleomorphism increased and microplicae of the cell membrane decreased in the IC/BPS group, and both were more severe than in the control group (p = 0.022 and 0.007, respectively). The patients with moderate to severe defects of umbrella cell integrity had more severe bladder pain and smaller maximal bladder capacity (MBC) (both p = 0.010). Patients with moderate to severe defects in microplicae of the cell membrane had smaller cystometric bladder capacity and MBC (p = 0.037 and 0.047, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The results revealed significant urothelium defects in IC/BPS, especially in the umbrella cells.

Geological and hydrogeological conditions in karst areas are complicated from the viewpoint of engineering. The construction of underground structures in these areas is often disturbed by the gushing of karst water, which may delay the construction schedule, result in economic losses, and even cause heavy casualties. In this paper, an innovative method of multichannel transient Rayleigh wave detecting is proposed by introducing the concept of arrival time difference phase between channels (TDP). Overcoming the restriction of the space-sampling law, the proposed method can extract the phase velocities of different frequency components from only two channels of transient Rayleigh wave recorded on two adjacent detecting points. This feature greatly improves the work efficiency and lateral resolution of transient Rayleigh wave detecting. The improved multichannel transient Rayleigh wave detecting method is applied to the detection of karst caves and fractures in rock mass of the foundation pit of Yan’an Road Station of Guiyang Metro. The imaging of the detecting results clearly reveals the distribution of karst water inflow channels, which provided significant guidance for water plugging and enabled good control over karst water gushing in the foundation pit.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>28f7d0b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0199030</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0c3:2835af05</id><author><name>Xuhui Zheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xuhui Zheng, Lei Liu, Jinzhong Sun, Gao Li, Fubiao Zhou, Jiemin Xu&lt;/p&gt;

We extend our analysis of zebrafish development to show that bHLH activity is responsible for the mediolateral patterning of the entire mesodermal germ layer.</description><engagementRate>1.31</engagementRate><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31018</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OPful2fUMb8/article</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/feed</streamId><title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles</title></origin><title>Porcupine: A visual pipeline tool for neuroimaging analysis</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006064</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006064</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tim van Mourik, Lukas Snoek, Tomas Knapen, David G.

The field of neuroimaging is rapidly adopting a more reproducible approach to data acquisition and analysis. Data structures and formats are being standardised and data analyses are getting more automated. However, as data analysis becomes more complicated, researchers often have to write longer analysis scripts, spanning different tools across multiple programming languages. This makes it more difficult to share or recreate code, reducing the reproducibility of the analysis. We present a tool, Porcupine, that constructs one’s analysis visually and automatically produces analysis code. The graphical representation improves understanding of the performed analysis, while retaining the flexibility of modifying the produced code manually to custom needs. Not only does Porcupine produce the analysis code, it also creates a shareable environment for running the code in the form of a Docker image. Together, this forms a reproducible way of constructing, visualising and sharing one’s analysis. Currently, Porcupine links to Nipype functionalities, which in turn accesses most standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Our goal is to release researchers from the constraints of specific implementation details, thereby freeing them to think about novel and creative ways to solve a given problem. Porcupine improves the overview researchers have of their processing pipelines, and facilitates both the development and communication of their work. This will reduce the threshold at which less expert users can generate reusable pipelines. With Porcupine, we bridge the gap between a conceptual and an implementational level of analysis and make it easier for researchers to create reproducible and shareable science. We provide a wide range of examples and documentation, as well as installer files for all platforms on our website: https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine.

Dairy donkey milking procedures require separating foals from their dams for a few hours a day. Artificial suckling in this species is a good technique for improving milk production and foal welfare. The aim of the work is to compare the effect of two different diets on donkey foals when separated from jennies for milking procedures with and without a milk replacer. Forty newborn Martina Franca donkey foals were subdivided into two experimental groups. Both groups were separated from their respective dams from 8.00to 20.00to allow the jennies to be milked. During the separation, all the foals had access &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; to water, hay and feed. During the separation period, one group had the availability of a mechanical milk replacer dispenser, so foals were partially artificially suckled (AS), while the other group had no milk replacer available, and so were totally naturally suckled (NS). The AS group had milk replacer availability until 120±7d of life. Both groups were naturally weaned at 168±7d. Blood samples were collected weekly starting from birth until two wks after weaning (i.e. at 182d), from all the foals included in the trial.

Dairy donkey milking procedures require separating foals from their dams for a few hours a day. Artificial suckling in this species is a good technique for improving milk production and foal welfare. The aim of the work is to compare the effect of two different diets on donkey foals when separated from jennies for milking procedures with and without a milk replacer. Forty newborn Martina Franca donkey foals were subdivided into two experimental groups. Both groups were separated from their respective dams from 8.00to 20.00to allow the jennies to be milked. During the separation, all the foals had access &lt;i&gt;ad libitum&lt;/i&gt; to water, hay and feed. During the separation period, one group had the availability of a mechanical milk replacer dispenser, so foals were partially artificially suckled (AS), while the other group had no milk replacer available, and so were totally naturally suckled (NS). The AS group had milk replacer availability until 120±7d of life. Both groups were naturally weaned at 168±7d. Blood samples were collected weekly starting from birth until two wks after weaning (i.e. at 182d), from all the foals included in the trial. Almost all the analytes were influenced by suckling technique and age of foals. Alanine-aminotransferase, aspartate-aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, NEFA, lipid hydroperoxides, serum proteins showed the greatest differences between the two experimental groups. Separating foals from their dams for 12hdaily for 24 weeks does not lead to pathological subclinical and metabolic conditions, thus confirming the high rusticity and resistance of the donkey.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>&amp;lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&amp;lt;/i&gt; administration induces hepatic damage and subcutaneous fat accumulation in high-fat diet fed mice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198262</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anniina Keskitalo, Eveliina Munukka, Raine Toivonen, Maija Hollmén, Heikki Kainulainen, Pentti Huovinen, Sirpa Jalkanen, Satu Pekkala&lt;/p&gt;
Accumulating evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a significant role in obesity, insulin resistance and associated liver disorders. Family &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and especially &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter cloacae&lt;/i&gt; strain B29 have been previously linked to obesity and hepatic damage. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Therefore, we comprehensively examined the effects of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC® 13047™) administration on host metabolism of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). C57BL/6N mice were randomly divided into HFD control, chow control, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment groups. The &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; treatment group received live bacterial cells in PBS intragastrically twice a week, every other week for 13 weeks. Both control groups received PBS intragastrically. After the 13-week treatment period, the mice were sacrificed for gene and protein expression and functional analyses. Our results show that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cloacae&lt;/i&gt; administration increased subcutaneous fat mass and the relative proportion of hypertrophic adipocytes. Both subcutaneous and visceral fat had signs of decreased insulin signaling and elevated lipolysis that was reflected in higher serum glycerol levels.

When given privileged information of an object’s true location, adults often overestimate the likelihood that a protagonist holding a false belief will search in the correct location for that object. This type of egocentric bias is often labelled the ‘curse of knowledge’. Interestingly, the magnitude of this bias may be modulated by the social distance between the perspective taker and target. However, this social distance effect has yet to be fully demonstrated when adults reason about false beliefs. Using a continuous false belief task, we investigated i) whether adults were biased by their own knowledge when reasoning about another’s false belief, ii) whether the magnitude of this egocentric bias was modulated by social distance, and iii) whether this social distance effect extended to a heterospecific out-group, namely a dog. To test these hypotheses we conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1 (N = 283), we used an established continuous false belief task, in Experiment 2 (N = 281) we modified this task, and Experiment 3 (N = 744) was a direct replication of Experiment 2. Across these experiments, the curse of knowledge effect was reliably replicated when adults mentalised about an in-group protagonist, and replicated in two of the three studies (Experiments 1 and 3) when adults mentalised about out-group protagonists. In an internal-meta analysis, the curse of knowledge effect was present across all conditions, and there was no effect of social distance. Hence, overall these data are not consistent with the hypothesis that social distance modulates adults’ egocentric biases when reasoning about false beliefs. The finding that egocentric biases of a similar magnitude were observed when adults mentalised about an in-group protagonist and a dog suggests that interpersonal dissimilarity is not in itself sufficient to reduce egocentric bias when reasoning about false beliefs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>db9f8377</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198616</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b8:2835af05</id><author><name>Benjamin G.

Using 3D anatomical landmarks from adult human head MRIs, we assessed the magnitude of inter-operator differences in Procrustes-based geometric morphometric analyses. An in depth analysis of both absolute and relative error was performed in a subsample of individuals with replicated digitization by three different operators. The effect of inter-operator differences was also explored in a large sample of more than 900 individuals. Although absolute error was not unusual for MRI measurements, including bone landmarks, shape was particularly affected by differences among operators, with up to more than 30% of sample variation accounted for by this type of error. The magnitude of the bias was such that it dominated the main pattern of bone and total (all landmarks included) shape variation, largely surpassing the effect of sex differences between hundreds of men and women. In contrast, however, we found higher reproducibility in soft-tissue nasal landmarks, despite relatively larger errors in estimates of nasal size. Our study exemplifies the assessment of measurement error using geometric morphometrics on landmarks from MRIs and stresses the importance of relating it to total sample variance within the specific methodological framework being used. In summary, precise landmarks may not necessarily imply negligible errors, especially in shape data; indeed, size and shape may be differentially impacted by measurement error and different types of landmarks may have relatively larger or smaller errors. Importantly, and consistently with other recent studies using geometric morphometrics on digital images (which, however, were not specific to MRI data), this study showed that inter-operator biases can be a major source of error in the analysis of large samples, as those that are becoming increasingly common in the &apos;era of big data&apos;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527022800000</published><updated>1527022800000</updated><fingerprint>7d3a5c55</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197675</link><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709405f:2835af05</id><author><name>Amro Daboul</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Amro Daboul, Tatyana Ivanovska, Robin Bülow, Reiner Biffar, Andrea Cardini&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals often respond differently to the same vaccine; some of this variation may be caused by genetic differences among animals. Our objective was to estimate heritability and identify genomic regions associated with humoral response to an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine in beef cattle. Crossbred beef cattle (n = 651) were vaccinated with a commercially available &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine. Serum was collected at time of initial vaccination (d 0), booster (d 21), and d 56 after initial vaccination. Total antibodies specific to siderophore receptor and porin proteins in the vaccine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped with the bovine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler-High Density 78K or 26K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism BeadChip and imputed to 777,000 SNP genotypes. Heritability was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using both 1) pedigree and 2) genomic relationships among individuals. Fixed effects were contemporary group, calf age, sex, principal components from SNP genotype data, and pedigree-derived heterozygosity effects. Additive and dominance effects of SNPs were estimated individually while accounting for contemporary group, sex, and the top 20 principal components calculated from the genomic relationship matrix. Heritability of initial response to vaccination (d 21 –d 0) was 0.10 ± 0.175 using pedigree relationships and 0.14 ± 0.149 using genomic relationships, but neither estimate was statistically different from zero. Heritability of booster (d 56 –d 21) and overall (d 56 –d 0) responses were low and not statistically significant from zero. There were no clusters of linked SNP associated with vaccine response, but eight regionally isolated SNPs were significantly associated with initial or overall response to vaccination. Regional genetic variation for initial response to an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine was observed, although overall heritability of this response was not statistically significant from zero.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>c97b81b1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197347</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd8:2835af05</id><author><name>Kara B.

Serious game development for rehabilitation therapy is becoming increasingly popular because of the motivational advantages that these types of applications provide. Consequently, the need for a common process framework for this category of software development has become increasingly evident. The goal is to guarantee that products are developed and validated by following a coherent and systematic method that leads to high-quality serious games. This paper introduces a new process framework for the development of serious games for motor rehabilitation therapy. We introduce the new model and demonstrate its application for the development of a serious game for the improvement of the balance and postural control of adults with cerebral palsy. The development of this application has been facilitated by two technological transfer contracts and is being exploited by two different organizations. According to clinical measurements, patients using the application improved from high fall risk to moderate fall risk. We believe that our development strategy can be useful not only for motor rehabilitation therapy, but also for the development of serious games in many other rehabilitation areas.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>3b3feed1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197383</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b4:2835af05</id><author><name>Esperança Amengual Alcover</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Esperança Amengual Alcover, Antoni Jaume-i-Capó, Biel Moyà-Alcover&lt;/p&gt;

Hybrid triploid loaches (&lt;i&gt;Misgurnus anguillicaudatus&lt;/i&gt;) were generated from natural tetraploid and diploid loaches. We studied the gonads of parents and offspring from direct and reciprocal crosses through histological and transcriptome analyses. The triploid offspring had inferior ability to form sperm and egg cells compared with diploid forms. After sequencing the transcriptomes, 655,109,158 clean reads were obtained, and 62,821 unigenes and 178,962 transcripts were assembled. Of these unigenes, 23,189 were annotated in the GO database, 18,525 in the KEGG database and 24,661 in the KOG database. 36 fertility-related genes were found to be differentially expressed between the direct cross (2n × 4n) progenies and their parents, while 53 fertility-related genes between the reciprocal cross (4n × 2n) progenies and their parents. Following protein-protein interaction network analyses, 54 differentially expressed genes, including &lt;i&gt;PLCB4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cyp17a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pla2g4d&lt;/i&gt;, were mined, yielding candidate genes involved in the poor fertility of hybrid triploid loaches. This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>d593552c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198179</link><crawled>1527186241281</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639364b701:7ddb4ef:3dd877af</id><author><name>He Zhou</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by He Zhou, Qi-Zheng Xu, Rui Zhang, Zi-Xin Zhuang, Yin-Qiang Ma, Wei Wang, Tian-Yu Ma, Yi Sui, Yang Liu, Xiaojuan Cao&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first report of transcriptomes of gonads of hybrid triploid loaches and their parents, offering a substantial contribution to sequence resources for this species and providing a deep insight into the molecular mechanism controlling the fertility of hybrid triploid fish.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/QQxB_7dO10U/s41598-018-26844-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26844-0/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26844_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>390</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26844-0</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26844-0</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26844-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26844-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/QQxB_7dO10U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527750000000</published><fingerprint>196f0bcd</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26844-0</link><crawled>1527757899736</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_163b57787d8:2ea7741:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Nana Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L, Published online: 31 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26844-0&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26844-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The effect of duplex Surface mechanical attrition and nitriding treatment on corrosion resistance of stainless steel 316L&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/QQxB_7dO10U&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jmcmar/~3/_iD6Y5iPFZ8/acs.jmedchem.7b01565</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jmcmar</streamId><title>Journal of Medicinal Chemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] A Thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine Scaffold Is a Novel Negative Allosteric Modulator of the Dopamine D2 Receptor</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01565</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01565</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jmcmar/0/jmcmar.ahead-of-print/acs.jmedchem.7b01565/20180515/images/medium/jm-2017-01565m_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Medicinal Chemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01565&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

FtsZ, the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, has been recently shown to engage in intriguing treadmilling dynamics along the circumference of the division plane. When coreconstituted in vitro with FtsA, one of its natural membrane anchors, on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices compatible with treadmilling of curved polar filaments. Replacing FtsA by a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) to FtsZ, we have discovered conditions for the formation of dynamic rings, showing that the phenomenon is intrinsic to FtsZ. Ring formation is only observed for a narrow range of protein concentrations at the bilayer, which is highly modulated by free Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and depends upon guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Interestingly, the direction of rotation can be reversed by switching the mts from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the protein, implying that the filament attachment must have a perpendicular component to both curvature and polarity. Remarkably, this chirality switch concurs with previously shown inward or outward membrane deformations by the respective FtsZ mutants. Our results lead us to suggest an intrinsic helicity of FtsZ filaments with more than one direction of curvature, supporting earlier hypotheses and experimental evidence.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TcroNLOHfIw&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>29</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>b492f61a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004845</link><crawled>1526665337683</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16374585b53:17f2a:ae8b474d</id><author><name>Diego A.

Pomegranate fruit consumption has increased rapidly throughout the world, mainly because of its medical and nutritive attributes. Thus, considerable commercial and scientific interest exists in prolonging its postharvest life with non-chemical applications as much as possible to meet the year-round demand for this fruit. The present work aimed to study the effects of black seed oil (0.1% and 0.5%), propolis (0.01% and 0.1%) and fludioxonil (0.06%), with and without modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), on the postharvest quality of pomegranate cv. Wonderful. Treated fruits were stored at 6.5±1 °C and 90–95% relative humidity for 150 days. The results indicated that both black seed oil and propolis treatments significantly influenced the maintenance of fruit weight and quality. At 150 days after storage, the fruit weight loss of the samples treated with MAP + 0.5% black seed oil, MAP + 0.1% propolis and MAP alone were found to be 5.5%, 6.3%, and 9.1%, respectively, whereas the weight loss of the untreated control fruits was 19.8%. Application of either 0.5% black seed oil or 0.1% propolis, especially when combined with MAP, was also effective in controlling gray mold development and slowing the occurrence of chilling injury.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>14321823</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198411</link><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b955:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>İbrahim Kahramanoğlu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by İbrahim Kahramanoğlu, Mehmet Aktaş, Şerife Gündüz&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) were introduced to overcome some of the limitations of drug-eluting stent (DES) for PCI. Data regarding the clinical outcomes of the BVS versus DES beyond 2 years are emerging.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To study mid-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We searched online databases (PubMed/Medline, Embase, CENTRAL), several websites, meeting presentations and scientific session abstracts until August 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2017 for studies comparing Absorb BVS with second-generation DES. The primary outcome was target lesion failure (TLF). Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization (TLR) and definite/probable device thrombosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived using a random effects model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ten studies, seven randomized controlled trials and three propensity-matched observational studies, with a total of 7320 patients (BVS n = 4007; DES n = 3313) and a median follow-up duration of 30.5 months, were included. Risk of TLF was increased for BVS-treated patients (OR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.12–1.60], p = 0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). This was also the case for all myocardial infarction (1.58 [95% CI: 1.27–1.96], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%), TLR (1.48 [95% CI: 1.19–1.85], p&amp;lt;0.001, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%) and definite/probable device thrombosis (of 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86–3.89], p&amp;lt;0.001 and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 40.3%). This did not result in a difference in all-cause mortality (0.78 [95% CI: 0.58–1.04], p = 0.09, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0%). OR for very late (&gt;1 year) device thrombosis was 6.10 [95% CI: 1.40–26.65], p = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;At mid-term follow-up, BVS was associated with an increased risk of TLF, MI, TLR and definite/probable device thrombosis, but this did not result in an increased risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525899600000</published><updated>1525899600000</updated><fingerprint>c67c998b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197119</link><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bee3:2835af05</id><author><name>Cordula M.

However, it remains a major challenge to gain insights from a large number of RNA-seq experiments collectively, due to the normalization problem. Current normalization methods are based on assumptions that fail to hold when RNA-seq profiles become more abundant and heterogeneous. We present a normalization procedure that does not rely on these assumptions, or on prior knowledge about the reference transcripts in those conditions.

However, it remains a major challenge to gain insights from a large number of RNA-seq experiments collectively, due to the normalization problem. Current normalization methods are based on assumptions that fail to hold when RNA-seq profiles become more abundant and heterogeneous. We present a normalization procedure that does not rely on these assumptions, or on prior knowledge about the reference transcripts in those conditions. This algorithm is based on a graph constructed from intrinsic correlations among RNA-seq transcripts and seeks to identify a set of densely connected vertices as references. Application of this algorithm on our benchmark data showed that it can recover the reference transcripts with high precision, thus resulting in high-quality normalization. As demonstrated on a real data set, this algorithm gives good results and is efficient enough to be applicable to real-life data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Hybrid_Particle-Field_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_of_Charged_Amphiphiles_in_Aqueous_Environment/6264644</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://chemrxiv.org/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/https://chemrxiv.org/rss/portal/chemrxiv</streamId><title>ChemRxiv RSS Feed</title></origin><title>Hybrid Particle-Field Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Charged Amphiphiles in Aqueous Environment</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl></canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Hybrid_Particle-Field_Molecular_Dynamics_Simulations_of_Charged_Amphiphiles_in_Aqueous_Environment/6264644</originId><summary><content>We develop and test specific coarse-grained models for charged amphiphilic systems such as palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) lipid bilayer, and sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) surfactant in aqueous environment, to verify the ability of the hybrid particle-field method to provide a realistic description of polyelectrolyte soft-matter systems.

Muscle wasting occurs during various chronic diseases and precedes death in humans as in mice. The evaluation of the degree of muscle atrophy in diseased mouse models is often overlooked since it requires the sacrifice of the animals for muscle examination or expensive instrumentation and highly qualified personnel, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Very often behavioral tests for muscle strength evaluation are used as an outcome measurement in preclinical therapeutic trials. However, these tests are easy to perform serially, but not enough sensitive to detect early muscle changes during disease progression. Monitoring muscle loss in living animals could allow to perform more informative preclinical trials with a better evaluation of therapeutic benefit with respect to muscle wasting. We developed a non-invasive procedure based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) without contrast agents to monitor hind limb muscle wasting in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and cancer cachexia: the transgenic SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mouse and the colon adenocarcinoma C26-bearing mouse, respectively. We established the scanning procedure and the parameters to consider in the reconstructed images to calculate the Index of Muscle Mass (IMM). The coefficient of variance for the whole procedure was 2.2%. We performed longitudinally micro-CT scan of hind limbs in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of the disease and calculated the IMM. We found that IMM in SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice was lower than age-matched controls even before symptom onset. We also detected a further decrease in IMM as disease progresses, most markedly just before disease onset. We performed the same analyses in the C26-based mouse model losing quickly body and muscle mass because of cancer cachexia. Overall, we found that the reduced muscle content detected by micro-CT mirrored the reduced muscle weight in both disease models. We developed a fast, precise and easy-to-conduct imaging procedure to monitor hind limb muscle mass, useful in therapeutic preclinical trials but also in proof-of-principle studies to identify the onset of muscle wasting. This method could be widely applied to other disease models characterized by muscle wasting, to assist drug development and search for early biomarkers of muscle atrophy. Moreover, reducing the number of mice needed for the experiments and being less distressing are in line with the 3R principle embodied in national and international directives for animal research.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>5a5c18dd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198089</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c1d:3dd877af</id><author><name>Laura Pasetto</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Laura Pasetto, Davide Olivari, Giovanni Nardo, Maria Chiara Trolese, Caterina Bendotti, Rosanna Piccirillo, Valentina Bonetto&lt;/p&gt;

High-resolution (functional) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at ultra high magnetic fields (7 Tesla and above) enables researchers to study how anatomical and functional properties change within the cortical ribbon, along surfaces and across cortical depths. These studies require an accurate delineation of the gray matter ribbon, which often suffers from inclusion of blood vessels, dura mater and other non-brain tissue. Residual segmentation errors are commonly corrected by browsing the data slice-by-slice and manually changing labels. This task becomes increasingly laborious and prone to error at higher resolutions since both work and error scale with the number of voxels. Here we show that many mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations as an additional post-processing step aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations openly available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>ad897d04</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198335</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4f:2835af05</id><author><name>Omer Faruk Gulban</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Omer Faruk Gulban, Marian Schneider, Ingo Marquardt, Roy A.

Here we show that many mislabeled, non-brain voxels can be corrected more efficiently and semi-automatically by representing three-dimensional anatomical images using two-dimensional histograms. We propose both a uni-modal (based on first spatial derivative) and multi-modal (based on compositional data analysis) approach to this representation and quantify the benefits in 7 Tesla MRI data of nine volunteers. We present an openly accessible Python implementation of these approaches and demonstrate that editing cortical segmentations using two-dimensional histogram representations as an additional post-processing step aids existing algorithms and yields improved gray matter borders. By making our data and corresponding expert (ground truth) segmentations openly available, we facilitate future efforts to develop and test segmentation algorithms on this challenging type of data.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197620</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>First description of &amp;lt;i&gt;Echinococcus ortleppi&amp;lt;/i&gt; and cystic echinococcosis infection status in Chile</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197620</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197620</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Felipe Corrêa, Caroll Stoore, Pamina Horlacher, Mauricio Jiménez, Christian Hidalgo, Cristian A.

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years.

Background &lt;p&gt;There is evidence that maternal genotypes in folate-related genes are associated with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) independent of offspring genotype. We evaluated the relationship between maternal genotypes in methionine synthase (&lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;) and DNA methylation status in ALL to better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying this association.&lt;/p&gt; Procedure &lt;p&gt;We obtained bone marrow samples from 51 patients with ALL at diagnosis and from 6 healthy donors. Mothers of patients provided a saliva sample and were genotyped at 11 tagSNPs in &lt;i&gt;MTR&lt;/i&gt;. DNA methylation was measured in bone marrow mononuclear cells of patients and six healthy marrow donors. We used hierarchical clustering to identify patients with a hypermethylator phenotype based on 281 differentially methylated promoter CpGs. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of maternal genotype on the likelihood of DNA hypermethylation in ALL and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify networks enriched for differentially methylated genes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-two cases (43%) demonstrated promoter hypermethylation, which was more frequent among those with &lt;i&gt;ETV6-RUNX1&lt;/i&gt; fusion and initial white blood cell count &amp;lt; 50 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;/L. Maternal rs12759827 was associated with aberrant DNA methylation (odds ratio [OR] 4.67, 95% confidence interval 1.46–16.31); non-significantly elevated ORs were observed for all other SNPs. Aberrantly methylated promoter CpGs aligned to genes with known cancer-related functions.&lt;/p&gt; Discussion &lt;p&gt;Maternal folate metabolic genotype may be associated with DNA methylation patterns in ALL in their offspring. Therefore, the effect of maternal genotypes on ALL susceptibility may act through aberrant promoter methylation, which may contribute to the &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; origins of ALL.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>68c38dc2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197408</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b8a:93d646dc</id><author><name>Jeremy M.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To compare the relative changes in muscle-tendon complex (MTC) properties following high load resistance training (RT) in young males and females, and determine any link with circulating TGFβ-1 and IGF-I levels.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Twenty-eight participants were assigned to a training group and subdivided by sex (T males [TM] aged 20±1 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, T females [TF] aged 19±3 year, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8), whilst age-matched 6 males and 6 females were assigned to control groups (ConM/F). The training groups completed 8 weeks of resistance training (RT). MTC properties (Vastus Lateralis, VL) physiological cross-sectional area (pCSA), quadriceps torque, patella tendon stiffness [K], Young’s modulus, volume, cross-sectional area, and length, circulating levels of TGFβ-1 and IGF-I were assessed at baseline and post RT.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Post RT, there was a significant increase in the mechanical and morphological properties of the MTC in both training groups, compared to ConM/F (p&amp;lt;0.001). However, there were no significant sex-specific changes in most MTC variables. There were however significant sex differences in changes in K, with females exhibiting greater changes than males at lower MVC (Maximal Voluntary Contraction) force levels (10% p = 0.030 &amp;amp; 20% MVC p = 0.032) and the opposite effect seen at higher force levels (90% p = 0.040 &amp;amp; 100% MVC p = 0.044). There were significant increases (p&amp;lt;0.05) in IGF-I in both TF and TM following training, with no change in TGFβ-1. There were no gender differences (p&gt;0.05) in IGF-I or TGFβ-1. Interestingly, pooled population data showed that TGFβ-1 correlated with K at baseline, with no correlations identified between IGF-I and MTC properties.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Greater resting TGFβ-1 levels are associated with superior tendon mechanical properties.

Exploiting these findings, the potency and selectivity of chimeric antigen receptors targeted against cancer were substantially enhanced by modulating the number of encoded ITAMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022798?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Oil-water interfaces with surfactants: A systematic approach to determine coarse-grained model parameters</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022798?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527573231000</published><fingerprint>28ce14cc</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5022798?af=R</link><crawled>1527745631525</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163b4bc5525:2c9d430:3dd877af</id><author><name>Tuan V.

Kava is regaining its popularity with detailed characterizations warranted. We developed an ultraperformance liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for major kavalactones (kavain, dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin and desmethoxyyangonin) with excellent selectivity and specificity. The method has been validated for different matrices following the Food and Drug Administration guidance of analytical procedures and methods validation. The scope of this method has been demonstrated by quantifying these kavalactones in two kava products, characterizing their tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics in mice, and detecting their presence in human urines and plasmas upon kava intake. As expected, the abundances of these kavalactones differed significantly in kava products. All of them exhibited a large volume of distribution with extensive tissue affinity and adequate mean residence time (MRT) in mice. This method also successfully quantified these kavalactones in human body fluids upon kava consumption at the recommended human dose. This UPLC-MS/MS method therefore can be used to characterize kava products and its pharmacokinetics in animals and in humans.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>43b7541</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197940</link><crawled>1527185525072</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639359c950:8194e29:2835af05</id><author><name>Yi Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yi Wang, Shainnel O.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;In addition to conventional therapies, several new strategies have been proposed for modulating autoimmune diseases, including the adoptive transfer of immunological cells. In this context, dendritic cells (DCs) appear to be one of the most promising treatments for autoimmune disorders. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of adoptive transfer of DCs obtained from both naïve and ovalbumin (OVA)-tolerant mice on the severity of TNBS induced colitis and analyze the eventual protective mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and results &lt;p&gt;To induce oral tolerance, BALB/c mice were fed 4mg/mL OVA solution for seven consecutive days. Spleen DCs were isolated from tolerant (tDC) and naïve (nDC) mice, and then adoptively transferred to syngeneic mice. Three days later, colitis was induced in DC treated mice by intrarectal instillation of 100μg2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol. Control subjects received only intrarectal instillation of either TNBS solution or a vehicle. Five days later, mice from all groups were euthanized and examined for physiological and immunological parameters. Regarding the phenotype, we observed that the frequencies of CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHC II&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD11&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MHCII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CD86&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were significantly lower in DCs isolated from tolerant mice than in those from naive mice. However, pretreatment with both types of DCs was able to significantly reduce clinical signs of colitis such as diarrhea, rectal prolapse, bleeding, and cachexia, although only treatment with tDCs was able to prevent weight loss from instillation of TNBS. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; proliferation of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs was significantly lower than that observed in splenic cell cultures of naïve mice. Although no significant difference was observed in the frequencies of Treg cells in the experimental groups, the frequency of Th17&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cellsand the secretion of IL-17 were more reduced in the cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with either type of DCs. The levels of IL-9 and IFN-γ were lower in supernatants of cells from mice treated with nDCs.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results allow us to conclude that the adoptive transfer of cells expressing CD11c is able to reduce the clinical and immunological signs of drug-induced colitis. Adoptive transfer of CD11c&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;DC isolated from both naive and tolerant mice altered the proliferative and T cell responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>15856e54</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196994</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475060:2835af05</id><author><name>Lisiery N.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no previously published data showing the protective effects of DCs from naïve or tolerant mice in the treatment of colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025887?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title></origin><title>Unexpected finite size effects in interfacial systems: Why bigger is not always better—Increase in uncertainty of surface tension with bulk phase width</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><summary><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 21, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></summary><unread>True</unread><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025887?af=R</originId><content><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/21&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 21&lt;/a&gt;, June 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528179178000</published><fingerprint>1eb9d418</fingerprint><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025887?af=R</link><crawled>1528356065737</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163d91ed1c9:63c5123:2835af05</id><author><name>Francis G.

Accurate characterization of morphological variation is crucial for generating reliable results and conclusions concerning changes and differences in form. Despite the prevalence of landmark-based geometric morphometric (GM) data in the scientific literature, a formal treatment of whether sampled landmarks adequately capture shape variation has remained elusive. Here, I introduce LaSEC (Landmark Sampling Evaluation Curve), a computational tool to assess the fidelity of morphological characterization by landmarks. This task is achieved by calculating how subsampled data converge to the pattern of shape variation in the full dataset as landmark sampling is increased incrementally. While the number of landmarks needed for adequate shape variation is dependent on individual datasets, LaSEC helps the user (1) identify under- and oversampling of landmarks; (2) assess robustness of morphological characterization; and (3) determine the number of landmarks that can be removed without compromising shape information. In practice, this knowledge could reduce time and cost associated with data collection, maintain statistical power in certain analyses, and enable the incorporation of incomplete, but important, specimens to the dataset. Results based on simulated shape data also reveal general properties of landmark data, including statistical consistency where sampling additional landmarks has the tendency to asymptotically improve the accuracy of morphological characterization. As landmark-based GM data become more widely adopted, LaSEC provides a systematic approach to evaluate and refine the collection of shape data––a goal paramount for accumulation and analysis of accurate morphological information.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>27613311</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198341</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b788:3dd877af</id><author><name>Akinobu Watanabe</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Akinobu Watanabe&lt;/p&gt;

The understanding of acclimation strategies to low temperature and water availability is decisive to ensure coffee crop sustainability, since these environmental conditions determine the suitability of cultivation areas. In this context, the impacts of single and combined exposure to drought and cold were evaluated in three genotypes of the two major cropped species, &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; cv. Icatu, &lt;i&gt;Coffea canephora&lt;/i&gt; cv. Apoatã, and the hybrid Obatã. Crucial traits of plant resilience to environmental stresses have been examined: photosynthesis, lipoperoxidation and the antioxidant response. Drought and/or cold promoted leaf dehydration, which was accompanied by stomatal and mesophyll limitations that impaired leaf C-assimilation in all genotypes. However, Icatu showed a lower impact upon stress exposure and a faster and complete photosynthetic recovery. Although lipoperoxidation was increased by drought (Icatu) and cold (all genotypes), it was greatly reduced by stress interaction, especially in Icatu. In fact, although the antioxidative system was reinforced under single drought and cold exposure (e.g., activity of enzymes as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, APX, glutathione reductase and catalase, CAT), the stronger increases were observed upon the simultaneous exposure to both stresses, which was accompanied with a transcriptional response of some genes, namely related to APX. Complementary, non-enzyme antioxidant molecules were promoted mostly by cold and the stress interaction, including α-tocopherol (in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;arabica&lt;/i&gt; plants), ascorbate (ASC), zeaxanthin, and phenolic compounds (all genotypes). In general, drought promoted antioxidant enzymes activity, whereas cold enhanced the synthesis of both enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidants, the latter likely related to a higher need of antioxidative capability when enzyme reactions were probably quite repressed by low temperature. Icatu showed the wider antioxidative capability, with the triggering of all studied antioxidative molecules by drought (except CAT), cold, and, particularly, stress interaction (except ASC), revealing a clear stress cross-tolerance. This justified the lower impacts on membrane lipoperoxidation and photosynthetic capacity under stress interaction conditions, related to a better ROS control. These findings are also relevant to coffee water management, showing that watering in the cold season should be largely avoided.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>458174e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198694</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd7:3dd877af</id><author><name>José C.

Here we show that these pores bind the abundant cellular polyanion IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10°C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse.

Here we show that these pores bind the abundant cellular polyanion IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, transforming viral stability from minutes to hours and allowing newly synthesised DNA to accumulate inside the capsid. An arginine ring within the pore coordinates IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which strengthens capsid hexamers by almost 10°C. Single molecule measurements demonstrate that this renders native HIV capsids highly stable and protected from spontaneous collapse.

We need all the reality checks we can get, &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6387/423&quot;&gt;and this one&lt;/a&gt; (reported by a large multinational team led out of Oxford) uses light scattering to get more mass resolution than I would have thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light scattering by small particles depends on their refractive index and the particle volume. Proteins have basically the same refractive index (the indices of the individual amino acids don’t vary that much, and it’s all averaged out). Likewise, the volume occupied by each amino acid is very similar as well, and putting these together means that if you do very accurate light scattering measurements (using interferometry) the signal you get should be proportional to the number of amino acid residues or the total mass. This effect has been predicted, but recent improvements in instrumentation have made it possible to actually observe this and use it in real applications. The group gives the technique the deliberately memorable name of iSCAMS (interferometric scattering mass spectrometry), and we’ll have to get used to the idea of being able to do “mass spec” with a microscope and visible light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over a range of proteins (both monomers and larger oligomers), the team found a very good correlation (within 1.8%, plus or minus half a per cent) between the interferomic signature and protein mass, one that (importantly) was not influenced by the three-dimensional shape of the protein itself. The correlation also held for lipid nanodisc species, which is a good sign. And since I was writing just the other day about glycosylated proteins, I note that they also observed various states of a highly glycosylated (up to half the molecular weight) HIV envelope complex, and could spot the differences there as well. So it look like the effect holds for a number of different biomolecule types, although I expect that there will be refinements to the scattering models for these as the technique is developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like it could be a very good technique for studying protein-protein interactions &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the potential advantage of spatial resolution as well. I’m not sure if you could ever get something like this to work in a living cell (the signal/noise would be a huge problem), but there’s a lot of biomolecular behavior that you could get new details on short of that. There are a lot of variations to try, such as different surfaces, and immobilized binding partners. This could be a good complement to techniques like SPR, only this time at a single-protein level. It’ll be interesting to see if it can get to the point of delivering on- and off-rates, which is one of SPR’s great advantages. As it stands now, the resolution of iSCAMS doesn’t seem good enough to detect small-molecule binding to individual proteins, but it could certainly pick up small molecule effects on protein complexes, and presumably effects on protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-polysaccharide interactions as well. That should keep everyone occupied!&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1525957661000</published><fingerprint>ff33f6dc</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13526</link><crawled>1525957853641</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_1634a2d01c9:138ca54:93d646dc</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>I’m always happy when a new analytical technique is worked out, especially one that’s applicable to biological binding assays, doesn’t require labeling of the species involved, and is orthogonal to the existing methods.

The ability of a wide range of psychological and actuarial measures to characterize crimes in the prison population has not yet been compared in a single study. Our main objective was to determine if the discriminant capacity of psychological measures (PM) and actuarial data (AD) varies according to the crime. An Ecuadorian sample of 576 men convicted of Robbery, Murder, Rape and Drug Possession crimes was evaluated through an &lt;i&gt;ad hoc&lt;/i&gt; questionnaire, prison files and the Spanish adaptation of the Personality Assessment Inventory. Discriminant analysis was used to establish, for each crime, the discriminant capacity and the classification accuracy of a model composed of AD (socio-demographic and judicial measures) and a second model incorporating PM. The AD showed a superior discriminant capacity, whilst the contribution of both types of measures varied according to the crime. The PM generated some increase in the correct classification percentages for Murder, Rape and Drug Possession, but their contribution was zero for the crime of Robbery. Specific profiles of each crime were obtained from the strongest significant correlations between the value of each explanatory variable and the probability of belonging to the crime. The AD model is more robust when these four crimes are characterized. The contribution of AD and PM depends on the crime, and the inclusion of PM in actuarial models moderately optimizes the classification accuracy of Murder, Rape, and Drug Possession crimes.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>d74c834c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198251</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4e:2835af05</id><author><name>Carlos Burneo-Garcés</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Burneo-Garcés, Manuel Fernández-Alcántara, Agar Marín-Morales, Miguel Pérez-García&lt;/p&gt;

In 2015, several provinces in Lao People&apos;s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) experienced a vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreak. This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>1e68b1d1</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197370</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b85:93d646dc</id><author><name>Maude Pauly</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maude Pauly, Antony P.

This survey was conducted (i) to evaluate the vaccination coverage in different settings and cohorts using the seroprevalence of anti-poliovirus (PV) antibodies as a surrogate measure, and (ii) to explore the usefulness of an ELISA in a country with limited resources and a specific epidemiological setting. IgG antibodies were assessed by ELISA in Lao children (n = 1216) and adults (n = 1228), including blood donors and health care workers. Protective antibody titers against the 3 vaccine serotypes were determined by microneutralization (VNT) in a subset of participants. More than 92% of the children had anti-poliovirus antibodies, regardless of nutritional status or access to health care, highlighting the success of the vaccination outreach activities in the country. In contrast, anti-poliovirus seroprevalence reached only 81.7% in blood donors and 71.9% in health care workers. Participants born before the introduction of poliovirus vaccination in Lao PDR were considerably less likely to be seropositive. These findings align with the epidemiology of the outbreak. Neutralizing antibodies against at least one of the 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected in all children (99/99) and 93/99 had antibodies against all serotypes. Similarly, all health care workers had neutralizing antibodies against at least one and 92/99 against all serotypes. The comparison of both assays shows an acceptable underestimation of vaccine coverage in children by ELISA, but a low sensitivity of the ELISA in the adults. We show that the ELISA is a reasonable alternative to the VNT in particular in vaccinated children, that an improved version should be serotype specific, and that negativity thresholds should be revisited for optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thus, polio-free countries with an uncertain vaccination coverage and limited laboratory capacity, that are at risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks or of re-importation of wild poliovirus may benefit from an improved ELISA for cohort studies to evaluate their immunization program in children.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/hElpUcgk7t8/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Carrier-Free, Pure Nanodrug Formed by the Self-Assembly of an Anticancer Drug for Cancer Immune Therapy</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444/20180515/images/medium/mp-2018-004448_0001.gif</url><height>257</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444/20180515/images/medium/mp-2018-004448_0001.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00444&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Surface waters are important sources of water for drinking, industrial, agricultural, and recreational uses; hence, contamination of water by fecal, pathogenic, or antimicrobial resistant (AR) bacteria is a major environmental and public health concern. However, very little data is available on prevalence of these bacteria in surface water throughout a watershed. This study aimed to characterize &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; present in the Upper Oconee Watershed, a mixed-use watershed in Athens, GA, USA for potential pathogenicity and AR. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; were enumerated by colony counts, cultured by enrichment and direct plating, and characterized by phylo-groups, diarrheagenic pathotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibility. From the analysis, 99.3% (455/458) of the total samples were positive for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; resulting in 496 isolates. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; counts were as high as 1.2×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; CFU/100 ml, which is above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) threshold for recreational water (235 CFU/100 ml based on a one-time measurement). Phylo-groups B2 (31.7%; 157/496) and B1 (30.8%; 153/496) were the most prevalent among the isolates. Enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) (19/496) and Shiga toxin-producing &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; (STEC) (1/496) were the only diarrheagenic pathotypes detected. AR was observed in 6.9% (34/496) of the isolates, 15 of which were multidrug resistant (MDR; resistance to two or more classes of antimicrobials). Tetracycline resistance was most often detected (76.5%; 26/34), followed by ampicillin (32.4%; 11/34), streptomycin (23.5%; 8/34), sulfisoxazole (23.5%; 8/34), and nalidixic acid (14.7%; 5/34). Results from this study showed that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; is prevalent in high levels in the Upper Oconee Watershed, suggesting possible widespread fecal contamination.

Public transport (PT) is a key element in most major cities around the world. With the development of smartphones, available journey planning information is becoming an integral part of the PT system. Each traveler has specific preferences when undertaking a trip, and these preferences can also be reflected on the smartphone. This paper considers transit assignment in urban public-transport networks in which the passengers receive smartphone-based information containing elements that might influence the travel decisions in relation to line loads, as well as passenger benefits, and the paper discusses the transition from the current widespread choosing approach to a personalized decision-making approach based on smartphone information. The approach associated with smartphone guidance that considers passengers’ preference on travel time, waiting time and transfer is proposed in the process of obtaining his/her preferred route from the potential travel routes generated by the Deep First Search (DFS) method. Two other approaches, based on the scenarios reflecting reality, include passengers with access to no real time information, and passengers that only have access to the arrival time at the platform are used as comparisons. For illustration, the same network proposed by Spiess and Florian is utilized on the experiments in an agent-based model. Two experiments are conducted respectively according to whether each passenger’s choosing method is consistent. As expected, the results in the first experiment showed that the travel for consistent passengers with smartphone guidance was clearly shorter and that it can reduce travel time exceeding 15% and weighted cost exceeding 20%, and the average saved time approximated 3.88 minutes per passenger. The second experiment presented that travel cost, as well as cost savings, gradually decreased by employing smartphone guidance, and the maximum cost savings accounted for 14.2% of the total weighted cost.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>b8b45692</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197181</link><crawled>1525974120984</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1634b253a18:1559157:93d646dc</id><author><name>Cuiying Song</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cuiying Song, Wei Guan, Jihui Ma&lt;/p&gt;

Aims/Hypotheses &lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that there is decreased synthesis of glutathione (GSH) in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) especially in the presence of microvascular complications, and this is dependent on the degree of hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this case-control study, we recruited 16 patients with T2DM (7 without and 9 with microvascular complications), and 8 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls.

The magnitudes of changes in patients with complications were greater for both GSH concentrations and absolute synthesis rates (&lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt;values ≤ 0.01) compared to controls. There were no differences in GSH concentrations and synthesis rates between T2DM patients with and without complications (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-values &gt; 0.1). Fasting glucose and HbA1c did not correlate with GSH concentration or synthesis rates (&lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt;values &gt; 0.17).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Compared to non-diabetic controls, patients with T2DM have glutathione deficiency, especially if they have microvascular complications.

American Indians (AI) have high prevalence of diabetes in youth and may benefit from increasing physical activity as a strategy to improve metabolic health. We tested whether financial incentives would elicit greater frequency and/or duration of exercise in AI youth at high risk for developing diabetes. Overweight/obese AI boys and girls, 11–20 years old, were instructed to exercise on 3 days/week for 48 weeks at a tribal wellness center. The program was divided into three, 16-week-long phases to test different financial incentive strategies. Within each phase participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups that received different payments for exercise. Phase 1 was designed to test whether the size of the incentive would affect exercise frequency. In Phase 1, the number of exercise sessions did not differ between the group receiving a modest fixed-value payment per exercise session and the group receiving enhanced incentives to exercise more frequently (26 ± 3 versus 28 ± 2 sessions, respectively, p = 0.568). In Phase 2, the provision of an enhanced financial incentive to increase exercise duration resulted longer sessions, as the incentivized and standard payment groups exercised 38 ± 2 versus 29 ± 1 minutes per session (p = 0.002), respectively. In Phase 3, the effect of reducing the incentives on maintenance of exercise behaviors was inconclusive due to high participant withdrawal. Aerobic fitness increased 10% during Phase 1 but was unchanged thereafter. Insulin sensitivity and body composition were unchanged during the study. In conclusion, enhanced financial incentives increased the duration of exercise sessions, but had minimal effects on exercise participation. These results indicate that financial incentives hold promise in motivating previously sedentary, overweight/obese adolescents to exercise longer, but motivating them to sustain an exercise program remains the major challenge.

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) has become the tool of choice for genome editing. Despite the fact that it has evolved as a highly efficient means to edit/replace coding sequence, CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency for “clean” editing of non-coding DNA remains low. We set out to introduce a single base-pair substitution in two intronic SNPs at the &lt;i&gt;FTO&lt;/i&gt; locus without altering nearby non-coding sequence. Substitution efficiency increased up to 10-fold by treatment of human embryonic stem cells (ESC) with non-toxic levels of DMSO (1%) before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery. Treatment with DMSO did not result in CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects or compromise the chromosomal stability of the ESC. Twenty-four hour treatment of human ESC with DMSO before CRISPR/Cas9 delivery may prove a simple means to increase editing efficiency of non-coding DNA without incorporation of undesirable mutations.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>3</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>584e3b44</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198637</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b795:3dd877af</id><author><name>George Stratigopoulos</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by George Stratigopoulos, Maria Caterina De Rosa, Charles A.

Cotton root growth can be affected by different nitrogen fertilizer rates. The objective of the present study was to quantify the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on cotton root growth and distribution using minirhizotron and soil coring methods. A secondary objective was to evaluate the minirhizotron method as a tool for determining nitrogen application rates using the root distribution as an index. This study was conducted on a Bt cotton cultivar (Jimian 958) under four nitrogen fertilization rates, i.e., 0, 120, 240 and 480 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (control, low, moderate and high levels, respectively), in the Yellow River basin of China from 2013–2015. The sampling process, details of each method as well as the root morphology and root distribution were measured. The operational processes, time and labor needed for the soil core method were all greater than those for the minirhizotron method. The total root length density and the length density in most soil layers, especially in the upper soil layers, first increased but then decreased as nitrogen fertilization increased, and the same trend was observed for both methods. Compared with N0, the total root length density under moderate nitrogen fertilization by the soil coring method increased by more than 94.82%, in 2014 and 61.11% in 2015; while by the minirhizotron method the corresponding values were 28.24% in 2014 and 57.47%, in 2015. Most roots were distributed in the shallow soil layers (0–60 cm) in each method. However, the root distribution with the soil coring method (&gt;73.11%) was greater than that with the minirhizotron method (&gt;47.07%). The correlations between the root morphology indexes of shallow soil depth measured using the two methods were generally significant, with correlative coefficients greater than 0.334. We concluded that the minirhizotron method could be used for cotton root analysis and most cotton roots distributed in upper soil layers (0-60cm). In addition, a moderate nitrogen rate (240 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) could increase root growth, especially in the shallow soil layers. The differences observed with the minirhizotron method were clearer than those observed with the soil coring method.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>ca9bf785</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197284</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f7f:2835af05</id><author><name>Jing Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Chen, Liantao Liu, Zhanbiao Wang, Hongchun Sun, Yongjiang Zhang, Zhanyuan Lu, Cundong Li&lt;/p&gt;

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize the conserved molecular patterns in microorganisms and trigger myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and/or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) pathways that are critical for host defense against microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern TLR signaling remain incompletely understood. Regulator of calcineurin-1 (RCAN1), a small evolutionarily conserved protein that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, suppresses inflammation during &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; infection. Here, we define the roles for RCAN1 in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated TLR4 signaling. We compared the effects of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS challenge on bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type and RCAN1-deficient mice and found that RCAN1 deficiency increased the MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production (IL-6, TNF and MIP-2), whereas TRIF-interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE)-mediated cytokine production (IFNβ, RANTES and IP-10) was suppressed. RCAN1 deficiency caused increased IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity in the MyD88-dependent pathway, but impaired ISRE activation and reduced IRF7 expression in the TRIF-dependent pathway. Complementary studies of a mouse model of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS-induced acute pneumonia confirmed that RCAN1-deficient mice displayed greatly enhanced NF-κB activity and MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production, which correlated with enhanced pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils. By contrast, RCAN1 deficiency had little effect on the TRIF pathway &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory role of RCAN1 in TLR signaling, which differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF pathways.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>8bcfab3a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197491</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6b:3dd877af</id><author><name>Zheng Pang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zheng Pang, Robert D.

Loss or gain of copy number of the gene encoding the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (Rett and MeCP2 duplication syndrome), indicating that precisely regulated MeCP2 expression during development is critical for mental health. Consistent with this idea, MeCP2 null mutants exhibit synaptic regression in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual relay center in the thalamus, a phenotype resembling that of animals reared in the dark during the visual sensitive period. It remains unclear how MeCP2 expression is regulated during circuit formation and maturation, especially in excitatory and inhibitory populations of neurons. We found that, concomitant with the initiation of the dark-rearing sensitive period, MeCP2 protein levels were elevated in glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons of the dLGN. Moreover, MeCP2 expression in glutamatergic populations was selectively reduced by dark-rearing. Therefore, we propose that visual experience–dependent MeCP2 induction in glutamatergic populations is essential for synaptic maturation within the dLGN.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>1d70d078</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198268</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb928:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yuki Yagasaki</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Yagasaki, Goichi Miyoshi, Mariko Miyata&lt;/p&gt;

Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>8e92d384</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197424</link><crawled>1526493611198</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a1c04be:41f7c57:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jukka M.

Our findings suggest that normalization of LRRK2 activation could be a therapeutic approach for treating IBD, regardless of whether a &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; risk allele is involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/3_RN-6_88pw/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Expression of Concentrative Nucleoside Transporters (SLC28A) in the Human Placenta: Effects of Gestation Age and Prototype Differentiation-Affecting Agents</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238/20180525/images/medium/mp-2018-00238h_0008.gif</url><height>199</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238/20180525/images/medium/mp-2018-00238h_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00238&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. These tumors can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast the manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>3fdbca10</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006131</link><crawled>1527184669816</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163934cbc78:66797:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Seth Haney</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

Motor contagions are believed to be induced simply by action observation and cause an observer&apos;s action to become similar to the action observed.

We have implemented this grammar as a Bioconductor/R package called &lt;tt&gt;plyranges&lt;/tt&gt;.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Perceptions of community safety and social activity participation among youth in South Africa</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole De Wet, Oluwaseyi Somefun, Ndivhuwo Rambau&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Crime and violence causes massive disruptions to the health, survival and development of populations. In South Africa, incredibly high rates of crime and violence are noted. The country also has a very large youth population whose health, survival and development are key to economic growth. Among other efforts to encourage healthy youth development and the promotion of social activities such as sports, youth groups, choirs and so forth. This study examines the relationship between perceived community safety and the uptake of social activities among youth in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Data and methods &lt;p&gt;This paper uses data from the National Youth Lifestyle Survey (2008) with an unweighted sample of 4,391 youth (age12-22 years old). Using chi-square and logistic regression analysis the association between perceived community safety and social activity participation are tested.&lt;/p&gt; Findings &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that youth participation in social activities in South Africa is high (55% of males and 45% of females). Among males, the most prominent activity is sports (51.8%), while for females there is high participation in choir and singing groups (55.68%). More than 50% of males perceive their communities as risky while less than half of females feel the same. Male youth are more likely to participate in social activities if they perceive their communities as risky (OR = 1.04). Females (OR = 0.83), youth have a negative view of their future (OR = 0.43) are less likely to participate in social activities.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;There exists an association between youth’s perception of community safety and their participation in social activities. Whether sports and groups are protective or enabling environments for youth from unsafe communities is moot. More in-depth research is needed on why youth participate in these clubs and groups to truly understand the role of social activities in South African societies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526677200000</published><updated>1526677200000</updated><fingerprint>b2b960f2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197549</link><crawled>1526665323143</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16374582287:54c7223:2835af05</id><author><name>Nicole De Wet</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nicole De Wet, Oluwaseyi Somefun, Ndivhuwo Rambau&lt;/p&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although sustained hyperglycemia is a known risk factor of AF and poor ICU outcomes, emerging in-vitro studies reveal acute glycemic fluctuations to be an additional independent predictor of AF. The effect of acute glycemic fluctuations on the incidence of POAF in the clinical setting remains unclear. We aim to investigate the effect of the magnitude of acute perioperative glycemic fluctuations on the incidence of POAF in a multi-ethnic Southeast-Asian population.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We obtained data from1743 patients who underwent elective CABG in a tertiary heart centre from 2009–2011. Patients were kept to a tight baseline glycemic control in accordance with hospital protocol. The magnitude of the difference between the highest and lowest perioperative glucose levels up till the first 48 postoperative hours was employed as a measure of glycemic fluctuation. Patients were divided into 4 groups for analysis based on the magnitude of glycemic fluctuation:A)0-2mmol/L(N = 147); B)&gt;2-4mmol/L(N = 426); C)&gt;4-6mmol/L(N = 513); D)&gt;6mmol/L(N = 657).Our primary outcome was the incidence of POAF. Secondary outcomes included ICU and 30-day mortality and length of stay.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The overall incidence of POAF was 14.7%. This increased as the magnitude of glycemic fluctuation increased, and was statistically highest in Group D(16.4%) as compared with the other 3 sub-groups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed the magnitude of perioperative glycemic fluctuation to be an independent risk factor of POAF(O.R.1.06, 95% C.I.1.01–1.11, p = 0.014).ICU length of stay was statistically highest in Group D(63.1 hours, p = &amp;lt; .001). However, ICU and 30 day mortality rates were similar among the 4 groups.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Increased magnitudes of acute perioperative glycemic fluctuations are associated with a significantly increased risk of POAF and length of ICU stay; and should therefore be minimised but balanced against the risks of hypoglycemia so as to avoid POAF and optimise patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1528491600000</published><updated>1528491600000</updated><fingerprint>9ed30e1c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198533</link><crawled>1528479726970</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163e07dbd7a:701c0b1:2835af05</id><author><name>Ming Ann Sim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ming Ann Sim, Weiling Liu, Sophia T.

In high throughput applications, such as those found in bioinformatics and finance, it is important to determine accurate probability distribution functions despite only minimal information about data characteristics, and without using human subjectivity. Such an automated process for univariate data is implemented to achieve this goal by merging the maximum entropy method with single order statistics and maximum likelihood. The only required properties of the random variables are that they are continuous and that they are, or can be approximated as, independent and identically distributed. A quasi-log-likelihood function based on single order statistics for sampled uniform random data is used to empirically construct a sample size invariant universal scoring function. Then a probability density estimate is determined by iteratively improving trial cumulative distribution functions, where better estimates are quantified by the scoring function that identifies atypical fluctuations. This criterion resists under and over fitting data as an alternative to employing the Bayesian or Akaike information criterion. Multiple estimates for the probability density reflect uncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples. Scaled quantile residual plots are also introduced as an effective diagnostic to visualize the quality of the estimated probability densities. Benchmark tests show that estimates for the probability density function (PDF) converge to the true PDF as sample size increases on particularly difficult test probability densities that include cases with discontinuities, multi-resolution scales, heavy tails, and singularities. These results indicate the method has general applicability for high throughput statistical inference.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>7c17d2c4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196937</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f6d:2835af05</id><author><name>Jenny Farmer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jenny Farmer, Donald Jacobs&lt;/p&gt;

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>7</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>ad6cca5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006186</link><crawled>1527788607719</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163b74c18e7:c75cd:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Anton V.

Glial cells perform numerous functions to support neuron development and function, including axon wrapping, formation of the blood brain barrier, and enhancement of synaptic transmission. We have identified a novel gene, &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt;, which functions in glia of the central and peripheral nervous systems in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Reducing Raw levels in glia results in morphological defects in the brain and ventral nerve cord, as well as defects in neuron function, as revealed by decreased locomotion in crawling assays. Examination of the number of glia along peripheral nerves reveals a reduction in glial number upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. The reduced number of glia along peripheral nerves occurs as a result of decreased glial proliferation. As Raw has been shown to negatively regulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in other developmental contexts, we examined the expression of a JNK reporter and the downstream JNK target, &lt;i&gt;matrix metalloproteinase 1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;mmp1&lt;/i&gt;), and found that &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown results in increased reporter activity and Mmp1 levels. These results are consistent with previous studies showing increased Mmp levels lead to nerve cord defects similar to those observed upon &lt;i&gt;raw&lt;/i&gt; knockdown. In addition, knockdown of &lt;i&gt;puckered&lt;/i&gt;, a negative feedback regulator of JNK signaling, also causes a decrease in glial number. Thus, our studies have resulted in the identification of a new regulator of gliogenesis, and demonstrate that increased JNK signaling negatively impacts glial development.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>60</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>8f758c8c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198161</link><crawled>1527615725740</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163acfe20ac:2094c25:3dd877af</id><author><name>Diana Luong</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diana Luong, Luselena Perez, Jennifer C.

Thus, our studies have resulted in the identification of a new regulator of gliogenesis, and demonstrate that increased JNK signaling negatively impacts glial development.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198479</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Utility of serum &amp;lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&amp;lt;/i&gt;-galactomannan antigen to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198479</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198479</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Katsuhiro Yoshimura, Yuzo Suzuki, Yusuke Inoue, Koji Nishimoto, Kazutaka Mori, Masato Karayama, Hironao Hozumi, Kazuki Furuhashi, Noriyuki Enomoto, Tomoyuki Fujisawa, Yutaro Nakamura, Naoki Inui, Koushi Yokomura, Shiro Imokawa, Takafumi Suda&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies from South Ethiopia have shown that interventions that focus on intrapartum care substantially reduce maternal mortality and there is a need to operationalize health packages that could reduce stillbirths. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if a programme that aimed to improve maternal health, and mainly focusing on strengthening intrapartum care, also would reduce the number of stillbirths, and to estimate if there are other indicators that explains high stillbirth rates. Our study used a “continuum of care” approach and focussed on providing essential antenatal and obstetric services in communities through health extension workers, at antenatal and health facility services. In this follow up study, which includes the same 38.312 births registered by community health workers, shows that interventions focusing on improved intrapartum care can also reduce stillbirths (by 46%; from 14.5 to 7.8 per 1000 births). Other risk factors for stillbirths are mainly related to complications during delivery and illnesses during pregnancy. We show that focusing on Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care and antenatal services reduces stillbirths. However, the study also underlines that illnesses during pregnancy and complications during delivery still represent the main risk factors for stillbirths. This indicates that obstetric care need still to be strengthened, should include the continuum of care from home to the health facility, make care accessible to all, and reduce delays.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>897f5e30</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197708</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb911:3dd877af</id><author><name>Bernt Lindtjørn</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bernt Lindtjørn, Demissew Mitike, Zillo Zidda, Yaliso Yaya&lt;/p&gt;

REEs in the environment can be absorbed by plants and sequestered by plant phytoliths. Acid rain can directly or indirectly affect plant physiological functions. Currently, the effects of REEs and acid rain on phytolith-REEs complex in plants are not yet fully understood. In this study, a high-silicon accumulation crop, rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.), was selected as a representative of plants, and orthogonal experiments were conducted under various levels of lanthanum [La(III)] and pH. The results showed that various La(III) concentrations could significantly improve the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III) in germinated rice seeds. A pH of 4.5 promoted phytolith La(III) sequestration, while a pH of 3.5 inhibited sequestration. Compared with the single treatment with La(III), the combination of La(III) and acid rain inhibited the efficiency and sequestration of phytolith La(III). Correlation analysis showed that the efficiency of phytolith La(III) sequestration had no correlation with the production of phytolith but was closely correlated with the sequestration of phytolith La(III) and the physiological changes of germinated rice seeds. Phytolith morphology was an important factor affecting phytolith La(III) sequestration in germinated rice seeds, and the effect of tubes on sequestration was more significant than that of dumbbells. This study demonstrated that the formation of the phytolith and La(III) complex could be affected by exogenous La(III) and acid rain in germinated rice seeds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526418000000</published><updated>1526418000000</updated><fingerprint>2c3e3a09</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197365</link><crawled>1526406128356</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16364e522e4:3a23b83:93d646dc</id><author><name>Yong Si</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yong Si, Lihong Wang, Qing Zhou, Xiaohua Huang&lt;/p&gt;

This work aims at corroborating the importance and efficacy of mutual learning in motor imagery (MI) brain–computer interface (BCI) by leveraging the insights obtained through our participation in the BCI race of the Cybathlon event. We hypothesized that, contrary to the popular trend of focusing mostly on the machine learning aspects of MI BCI training, a comprehensive mutual learning methodology that reinstates the three learning pillars (at the machine, subject, and application level) as equally significant could lead to a BCI–user symbiotic system able to succeed in real-world scenarios such as the Cybathlon event. Two severely impaired participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), were trained following our mutual learning approach to control their avatar in a virtual BCI race game. The competition outcomes substantiate the effectiveness of this type of training. Most importantly, the present study is one among very few to provide multifaceted evidence on the efficacy of subject learning during BCI training. Learning correlates could be derived at all levels of the interface—application, BCI output, and electroencephalography (EEG) neuroimaging—with two end-users, sufficiently longitudinal evaluation, and, importantly, under real-world and even adverse conditions.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/XSdFB8wknvs&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>61</engagement><published>1525986000000</published><updated>1525986000000</updated><fingerprint>55657e49</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003787</link><crawled>1525974546490</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1634b2bb83a:4d2b0:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Serafeim Perdikis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Serafeim Perdikis, Luca Tonin, Sareh Saeedi, Christoph Schneider, José del R.

Although heterosis has significantly contributed to increases in worldwide crop production, the molecular mechanisms regulating this phenomenon are still unknown. In the present study, we used a comparative proteomic approach to explore hybrid vigor via the proteome of both the popcorn L54 ♀ and P8 ♂ genotypes and the resultant UENF/UEM01 hybrid cross. To analyze the differentially abundant proteins involved in heterosis, we used the primary roots of these genotypes to analyze growth parameters and extract proteins. The results of the growth parameter analysis showed that the mid- and best-parent heterosis were positive for root length and root dry matter but negative for root fresh matter, seedling fresh matter, and protein content. The comparative proteomic analysis identified 1343 proteins in the primary roots of hybrid UENF/UEM01 and its parental lines; 220 proteins were differentially regulated in terms of protein abundance. The mass spectrometry proteomic data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier “PXD009436”. A total of 62 regulated proteins were classified as nonadditive, of which 53.2% were classified as high parent abundance (+), 17.8% as above-high parent abundance (+ +), 16.1% as below-low parent abundance (− −), and 12.9% as low parent abundance (-). A total of 22 biological processes were associated with nonadditive proteins; processes involving translation, ribosome biogenesis, and energy-related metabolism represented 45.2% of the nonadditive proteins. Our results suggest that heterosis in the popcorn hybrid UENF/UEM01 at an early stage of plant development is associated with an up-regulation of proteins related to synthesis and energy metabolism.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>29931a48</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197114</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fd3:2835af05</id><author><name>Mathias F.

Bioaerosol sampling and identification are vital for the assessment and control of airborne pathogens, allergens, and toxins. In-situ analysis of chemical and biological particulate matter can significantly reduce the costs associated with sample preservation, transport, and analysis. The analysis of conventional filters is challenging, due to dilute samples in large collection regions. A low-cost cartridge for collection and analysis of aerosols is developed for use in epidemiological studies and personal exposure assessments. The cartridge collects aerosol samples in a micro-well which reduces particles losses due to the bounce and does not require any coating. The confined particle collection area (d&lt;sub&gt;well&lt;/sub&gt;~1.4 mm) allows reducing the elution volume for subsequent analysis. The performance of the cartridge is validated in laboratory studies using aerosolized bacterial spores (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;). Colony forming unit analysis is used for bacterial spore enumeration. Cartridge collection efficiency is evaluated by comparison with the reference filters and found to be consistent with tested flow rates. Sample recovery for the pipette elution is ~80%. Due to the high density of the collected sample, the cartridge is compatible with in-situ spectroscopic analysis and sample elution into the 10–20 μl liquid volume providing a significant increase in sample concentration for subsequent analysis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>a5613793</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197783</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb913:3dd877af</id><author><name>Jiayang He</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jiayang He, Nicola K.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;We retrospectively reviewed the evolution of segmentectomy for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and the feasibility of multi- and single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Of 348 patients undergoing surgery for TB, the medical records of 121 patients undergoing segmentectomy between January 1996 and November 2015 were reviewed. Clinical information and computed tomography (CT) image characteristics were investigated and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients underwent direct or intended thoracotomy. Sixty-four underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic segmentectomy (VATS), including 53 multi-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (MITS), and 11 single-incision thoracoscopic segmentectomy (SITS). Thirty-nine were converted to thoracotomy. The intended thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) and hospital stay (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) than the VATS group although the VATS group had higher grade of cavity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007). The intended thoracotomy group did not differ from converted thoracotomy in operative time, blood loss, or hospital stay, and the grade of pleural thickening was higher in the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). The converted thoracotomy group had more operative blood loss, hospital stay, and complication rate than the MITS group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009, respectively). The MITS group had lower pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, cavity, and tuberculoma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.017, respectively). The SITS group had lower grading in pleural thickening, peribronchial lymph node calcification, and aspergilloma grading than the converted thoracotomy group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002, 0.010, and 0.031, respectively). Four patients in the intended thoracotomy group and seven in the converted thoracotomy group had complications compared with three patients in the MITS and two in the SITS group. Risk factors of conversion were pleural thickening and peribronchial lymph node calcification.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Although segmentectomy is technically challenging in patients with pulmonary TB, it could be safely performed using MITS or SITS and should be attempted in selected patients.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To estimate the optimal allocation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV prevention funds for health departments in 52 jurisdictions, incorporating Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program funds, to improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum and prevent infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Using surveillance data from 2010 to 2012 and budgetary data from 2012, we divided the 52 health departments into 5 groups varying by number of persons living with diagnosed HIV (PLWDH), median annual CDC HIV prevention budget, and median annual HRSA expenditures supporting linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Using an optimization and a Bernoulli process model, we solved for the optimal CDC prevention budget allocation for each health department group. The optimal allocation distributed the funds across prevention interventions and populations at risk for HIV to prevent the greatest number of new HIV cases annually.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Both the HIV prevention interventions funded by the optimal allocation of CDC HIV prevention funds and the proportions of the budget allocated were similar across health department groups, particularly those representing the large majority of PLWDH.

&lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal mushroom that is well known for its ability to enhance human health, and products made from this fungus have been highly profitable. The substrate-degrading ability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; could be related to its growth. CAZy proteins were more abundant in its genome than in the other white rot fungi models. Among these CAZy proteins, changes in lignocellulolytic enzymes during growth have not been well studied. Using genomic, transcriptomic and secretomic analyses, this study focuses on the lignocellulolytic enzymes of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119 to determine which of these degradative enzymes contribute to its growth. From the genome sequencing data, genes belonging to CAZy protein families, especially genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, were investigated. The gene expression, protein abundance and enzymatic activity of lignocellulolytic enzymes in mycelia over a growth cycle were analysed. The overall expression cellulase was higher than that of hemicellulase and lignin-modifying enzymes, particularly during the development of fruiting bodies. The cellulase and hemicellulase abundances and activities increased after the fruiting bodies matured, when basidiospores were produced in massive quantities till the end of the growth cycle. Additionally, the protein abundances of the lignin-modifying enzymes and the expression of their corresponding genes, including laccases and lignin-degrading heme peroxidases, were highest when the mycelia fully spread in the compost bag. Type I cellobiohydrolase was observed to be the most abundant extracellular lignocellulolytic enzyme produced by the &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;lucidum&lt;/i&gt; strain G0119. The AA2 family haem peroxidases were the dominant lignin-modifying enzyme expressed during the mycelial growth phase, and several laccases might play roles during the formation of the primordium.

The balance between synthesis and degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix is severely altered in osteoarthritis, where degradation predominates. One reason for this imbalance is believed to be due to the ligation of the α5β1 integrin, the classic fibronectin (FN) receptor, with soluble FN fragments instead of insoluble FN fibrils, which induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Our objective was to determine whether the lack of α5β1-FN binding influences cartilage morphogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and whether non-ligated α5β1 protects or aggravates the course of osteoarthritis in mice. We engineered mice (&lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt;), whose chondrocytes express an α5β1 binding-deficient FN, by substituting the aspartic acid of the RGD cell-binding motif with a glutamic acid (FN-RGE). At an age of 5 months the knee joints were stressed either by forced exercise (moderate mechanical load) or by partially resecting the meniscus followed by forced exercise (high mechanical load). Sections of femoral articular knees were analysed by Safranin-O staining and by immunofluorescence to determine tissue morphology, extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinase expression. The articular cartilage from untrained control and &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; mice was normal, while the exposure to high mechanical load induced osteoarthritis characterized by proteoglycan and collagen type II loss. In the &lt;i&gt;Col2a-Cre;Fn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;RGE/fl&lt;/sup&gt; articular cartilage osteoarthritis progressed significantly faster than in wild type mice. Mechanistically, we observed increased expression of MMP-13 and MMP-3 metalloproteinases in FN-RGE expressing articular cartilage, which severely affected matrix remodelling. Our results underscore the critical role of FN-α5β1 adhesion as ECM sensor in circumstances of articular cartilage regeneration.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>ec04a9ce</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198559</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bd2:3dd877af</id><author><name>Maylin Almonte-Becerril</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Maylin Almonte-Becerril, Irene Gimeno-LLuch, Olga Villarroya, María Benito-Jardón, Juan Bautista Kouri, Mercedes Costell&lt;/p&gt;

Our results underscore the critical role of FN-α5β1 adhesion as ECM sensor in circumstances of articular cartilage regeneration.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330217v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title></origin><title>Virus and CTL dynamics in the extra-follicular and follicular tissue compartments in SIV-infected macaques [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/24/330217</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330217v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site. This contributes to the majority of the virus being present in the follicle and represents a barrier to virus control. Using mathematical models, we investigate these dynamics. Two models are analyzed. The first assumes that CTL can only become stimulated and expand in the extra-follicular compartment, with migration accounting for the presence of CTL in the follicle. In the second model, follicular CTL can also undergo antigen-induced expansion. Consistent with experi-mental data, both models predict increased virus compartmentalization in the presence of stronger CTL responses and lower virus loads, and a more pronounced rise of extra-follicular compared to follicular virus during CD8 cell depletion experiments. The mod-els, however, differ in other aspects. The follicular expansion model results in dynamics that promote the clearance of productive infection in the extrafollicular site, with any productively infected cells found being the result of immigration from the follicle. This is not observed in the model without follicular CTL expansion. The models further predict different consequences of introducing engineered, follicular-homing CTL, which has been proposed as a therapeutic means to improve virus control. Without follicular CTL expansion, this is predicted to result in a reduction of virus load in both compartments. The follicular CTL expansion model, however, makes the counter-intuitive prediction that addition of F-homing CTL not only results in a reduction of follicular virus load, but also in an increase in extrafollicular virus replication. These predictions remain to be ex-perimentally tested, which will be relevant for distinguishing between models and for understanding how therapeutic introduction of F-homing CTL might impact the overall dynamics of the infection.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527145200000</published><fingerprint>8243a912</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/330217v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1527200590947</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163943fac63:8309e30:2835af05</id><author><name>Wodarz, D.</name></author><description>Data from SIV-infected macaques indicate that virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are mostly present in the extrafollicular (EF) compartment of the lymphoid tissue, with reduced homing to the follicular (F) site.

The combination of number of adsorption sites, their geometry and the preferential tetrahedral hydrogen bonding pattern of water leads to frustration and disorder. We further characterize the dynamics of the water, as well as the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules and the nanotube, which are found to be more than one order of magnitude longer than water–water hydrogen bonds.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/342618v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title></origin><title>Machine learning techniques for classifying the mutagenic origins of point mutations [NEW RESULTS]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/08/342618</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/342618v1?rss=1</originId><content><content>There is increasing interest in developing diagnostics that discriminate individual mutagenic mechanisms in a range of applications that include identifying population specific mutagenesis and resolving distinct mutation signatures in cancer samples.

Background &lt;p&gt;Elevated serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations are common in the general population and are associated with chronic metabolic conditions and adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated secular trends in the burden of hyperuricaemia from 2006–2014 within the Irish health system.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;i&gt;National Kidney Disease Surveillance Programme&lt;/i&gt; was used to determine the prevalence of elevated sUA in adults, age &gt; 18 years, within the Irish health system. Hyperuricaemia was defined as sUA &gt; 416.4 μmol/L in men and &gt; 339.06 μmol/L in women, and prevalence was calculated as the proportion of patients per year with mean sUA levels above sex-specific thresholds. Temporal trends in prevalence were compared from 2006 to 2014 while general estimating equations (GEE) explored variation across calendar years expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;From 2006 to 2014, prevalence of hyperuricaemia increased from 19.7% to 25.0% in men and from 20.5% to 24.1% in women, P&amp;lt;0.001. The corresponding sUA concentrations increased significantly from 314.6 (93.9) in 2006 to 325.6 (96.2) in 2014, P&amp;lt;0.001. Age-specific prevalence increased in all groups from 2006 to 2014, and the magnitude of increase was similar for each age category. Adjusting for baseline demographic characteristics and illness indicators, the likelihood of hyperuricemia was greatest for patients in 2014; OR 1.45 (1.26–1.65) for men and OR 1.47 (1.29–1.67) in women vs 2006 (referent). Factors associated with hyperuricaemia included: worsening kidney function, elevated white cell count, raised serum phosphate and calcium levels, elevated total protein and higher haemoglobin concentrations, all P&amp;lt;0.001.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The burden of hyperuricaemia is substantial in the Irish health system and has increased in frequency over the past decade. Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527800400000</published><updated>1527800400000</updated><fingerprint>9456c5f9</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198197</link><crawled>1527863770858</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bbc6feea:3922888:2835af05</id><author><name>Arun Kumar A.

Advancing age, poorer kidney function, measures of nutrition and inflammation, and regional variation all contribute to increasing prevalence, but these do not fully explain emerging trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jcisd8/~3/SzrK3Ptb5qU/acs.jcim.7b00656</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jcisd8</streamId><title>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Multiclassification Prediction of Enzymatic Reactions for Oxidoreductases and Hydrolases Using Reaction Fingerprints and Machine Learning Methods</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00656/20180521/images/medium/ci-2017-00656j_0008.gif</url><height>252</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00656</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00656</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jcisd8/0/jcisd8.ahead-of-print/acs.jcim.7b00656/20180521/images/medium/ci-2017-00656j_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00656&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months. Continued efforts are required to improve management of SAM in routine settings as part of efforts to reduce inpatient mortality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>b46326de</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197607</link><crawled>1526578926796</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636f31d4cc:4b85435:93d646dc</id><author><name>Susan Gachau</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Susan Gachau, Grace Irimu, Philip Ayieko, Samuel Akech, Ambrose Agweyu, Mike English, on behalf of the Clinical Information Network Author Group &lt;/p&gt;

Calcium is an important second messenger in plants that is released into the cytosol early after recognition of various environmental stimuli. Decoding of such calcium signals by calcium sensors is the key for the plant to react appropriately to each stimulus. Several members of Calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) act as calcium sensors and some are known to mediate both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; CML9 in different stress responses. CML9 was reported earlier as defense regulator against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast to salicylic acid-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt;, defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic fungi are mediated by jasmonates. We demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; is induced upon wounding and feeding of the insect herbivore &lt;i&gt;Spodoptera littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. However, neither different &lt;i&gt;CML9&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutant lines nor overexpression lines were impaired upon insect feeding. No difference in herbivore-induced phytohormone elevation was detected in &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; lines. The defense against the spider mite &lt;i&gt;Tetranychus urticae&lt;/i&gt; was also unaffected. In addition, &lt;i&gt;cml9&lt;/i&gt; mutant lines showed a wild type-like reaction to the necrotrophic fungus &lt;i&gt;Alternaria brassicicola&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our data suggest that CML9 might be a regulator involved only in the defense against biotrophic pathogens, independent of jasmonates. In addition, our data challenge the involvement of CML9 in plant drought stress response. Taken together, we suggest that CML9 is a specialized rather than a general regulator of stress responses in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>68bdc357</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197633</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c8:2835af05</id><author><name>Monika Heyer</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Monika Heyer, Sandra S.

These results help to provide a paradigm for understanding functional differences between the many redundant, but distinct RNA species thought to act as miRNA sponges in nature, such as long non-coding RNA, pseudogenes, competing mRNA, circular RNA, and 3&apos; UTRs.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/mpohbp/~3/aFSDExeM7Gk/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00331</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Effective Remodelling of Human Osteoarthritic Cartilage by sox9 Gene Transfer and Overexpression upon Delivery of rAAV Vectors in Polymeric Micelles</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00331</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00331</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00331/20180524/images/medium/mp-2018-003312_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00331&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The smooth hammerhead shark, &lt;i&gt;Sphyrna zygaena&lt;/i&gt;, is a cosmopolitan semipelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic oceanic fisheries, especially pelagic longlines targeting swordfish and/or tunas. From 2012 to 2016, eight smooth hammerheads were tagged with Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags in the inter-tropical region of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, with successful transmissions received from seven tags (total of 319 tracking days). Results confirmed the smooth hammerhead is a highly mobile species, as the longest migration ever documented for this species (&gt; 6600 km) was recorded. An absence of a diel vertical movement behavior was noted, with the sharks spending most of their time at surface waters (0–50 m) above 23°C. The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders, and the overlap with the species vertical distribution was calculated. The overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles (~40% of overlap time). The novel information presented can now be used to contribute to the provision of sustainable management tools and serve as input for Ecological Risk Assessments for smooth hammerheads caught in Atlantic pelagic longline fisheries.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>5bd7dc4d</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198664</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f58:2835af05</id><author><name>Catarina C.

Women’s groups practicing participatory learning and action (PLA) in rural areas have been shown to improve maternal and newborn survival in low-income countries, but the pathways from intervention to impact remain unclear. We assessed the long-term impact of a PLA intervention in rural Nepal on women’s agency in the household. In 2014, we conducted a follow-up study to a cluster randomised controlled trial on the impact of PLA women’s groups from 2001–2003. Agency was measured using the Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) and its subdomains. Multi-level regression analyses were performed adjusting for baseline socio-demographic characteristics. We additionally adjusted for potential exposure to subsequent PLA groups based on women’s pregnancy status and conduct of PLA groups in areas of residence. Sensitivity analyses were performed using two alternative measures of agency. We analysed outcomes for 4030 mothers (66% of the cohort) who survived and were recruited to follow-up at mean age 39.6 years. Across a wide range of model specifications, we found no association between exposure to the original PLA intervention with women’s agency in the household approximately 11.5 years later. Subsequent exposure to PLA groups was not associated with greater agency in the household at follow-up, but some specifications found evidence for reduced agency. Household agency may be a prerequisite for actualising the benefits of PLA groups rather than a consequence.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>b4b9704f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197426</link><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a21a3:93d646dc</id><author><name>Lu Gram</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lu Gram, Jolene Skordis-Worrall, Dharma S.

Organic chemists like what it can do (cyclopropane formation, cycloadditions, fast, clean methyl ester formation, etc.), but the compound itself is very hard to have warm feelings for. It’s unstable on storage, and thus has to be prepared fresh. That preparation is fairly tedious, and you have to pay close attention to what you’re doing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2008/04/30/how_not_to_do_it_diazomethane&quot;&gt;unlike this guy&lt;/a&gt;), because the diazomethane product can and will decompose violently (and even explode) if you mishandle it. “Mishandle” includes, but is not limited to, making it too concentrated, exposing it to friction or rough surfaces, the presence of metals, etc. It’s also quite volatile and very toxic, explosions aside. That goes even for the less explosive form, trimethylsilyldiazomethane, which is stable enough to be an article of commerce but which is sadly &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2009/05/14/tms_diazomethane_update_on_a_fatality&quot;&gt;just as deadly&lt;/a&gt; as the original item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why you don’t see an awful lot of plain diazo compounds in the literature. The stabilized ones like ethyl diazoacetate are pretty common, but when’s the last time you heard about diazopropane? Or cyclopropyldiazomethane? Right, probably never, and that’s largely because the higher diazos, being less volatile, are no fun to prepare because you can’t distill them over in ether like you can the parent compound. By the time you’ve purified them, there’s not much left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802092?af=R&quot;&gt;This new paper&lt;/a&gt;, though, could change that. A group at Montréal has adapted a solution-phase prep (silver oxide and potassium carbonate) to flow chemistry, which is the natural home for these kinds of compounds. (&lt;em&gt;Update: see also &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201710445&quot;&gt;this recent paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Ley group – another flow approach&lt;/em&gt;). Running hydrazones in dichloromethane through a column of these reagents (mixed with Celite) gives you diazo compounds out the other end. But you can tell that these are lively compounds – when they tried this on acetone hydrazone at room temperature, they got a colorless stream and plenty of gas bubbles, because the 2-diazopropane had already decomposed. Lowering the temperature to -20C and cranking up the flow rate, though, gave a red solution which is the real thing, ready to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used this setup to produce a whole range of basically unknown diazo compounds (they’re yellow, orange, red, and purple in solution), and took them directly into esterification, cycloaddition, and cyclopropanation reactions. You’re not going to let these things sit around; unstabilized diazo formation is going to be an on-demand process no matter how it’s done. But it looks like these compounds are now open to experimentation in a way that they’ve never been before.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>5</engagement><published>1526388270000</published><fingerprint>44adea29</fingerprint><link>http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/?p=13538</link><crawled>1526388434380</crawled><id>2k24/TFePIh3MUUJr/vqRk++EkKG/RZ2TtOvsKiJXX4=_16363d725cc:3817c00:93d646dc</id><author><name>Derek Lowe</name></author><description>I don’t think that anyone really likes diazomethane.

Choosing valuable objects and rewarding actions is critical for survival. While such choices must be made in a way that suits the animal’s circumstances, the neural mechanisms underlying such context-appropriate behavior are unclear. To address this question, we devised a context-dependent reward-seeking task for macaque monkeys. Each trial started with the appearance of one of many visual scenes containing two or more objects, and the monkey had to choose the good object by saccade to get a reward. These scenes were categorized into two dimensions of emotional context: dangerous versus safe and rich versus poor. We found that many amygdala neurons were more strongly activated by dangerous scenes, by rich scenes, or by both. Furthermore, saccades to target objects occurred more quickly in dangerous than in safe scenes and were also quicker in rich than in poor scenes. Thus, amygdala neuronal activity and saccadic reaction times were negatively correlated in each monkey. These results suggest that amygdala neurons facilitate targeting saccades predictably based on aspects of emotional context, as is necessary for goal-directed and social behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UixC9bfw7t8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>15</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>74b263e4</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005339</link><crawled>1528221225324</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_163d115516c:13f96b:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Kazutaka Maeda</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kazutaka Maeda, Jun Kunimatsu, Okihide Hikosaka&lt;/p&gt;

Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß.

The protein kinase (PK, kinome) family is one of the largest families in plants and regulates almost all aspects of plant processes, including plant development and stress responses. Despite their important functions, comprehensive functional classification, evolutionary analysis and expression patterns of the cotton PK gene family has yet to be performed on PK genes. In this study, we identified the cotton kinomes in the &lt;i&gt;Gossypium raimondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium arboretum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gossypium hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gossypium barbadense&lt;/i&gt; genomes and classified them into 7 groups and 122–24 subfamilies using software HMMER v3.0 scanning and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis. Some conserved exon-intron structures were identified not only in cotton species but also in primitive plants, ferns and moss, suggesting the significant function and ancient origination of these PK genes. Collinearity analysis revealed that 16.6 million years ago (Mya) cotton-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) events may have played a partial role in the expansion of the cotton kinomes, whereas tandem duplication (TD) events mainly contributed to the expansion of the cotton RLK group. Synteny analysis revealed that tetraploidization of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; contributed to the expansion of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;hirsutum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;barbadense&lt;/i&gt; PKs. Global expression analysis of cotton PKs revealed stress-specific and fiber development-related expression patterns, suggesting that many cotton PKs might be involved in the regulation of the stress response and fiber development processes. This study provides foundational information for further studies on the evolution and molecular function of cotton PKs.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>3c6cb368</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197392</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7b5:2835af05</id><author><name>Jun Yan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jun Yan, Guilin Li, Xingqi Guo, Yang Li, Xuecheng Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.</description><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37018</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05161-6/d41586-018-05161-6_15756208.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05161-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gene collections and astronomy studies dominate the list of the most-cited publications with DOIs on the popular online encyclopaedia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>106</engagement><published>1526281200000</published><fingerprint>6b8208de</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6</link><crawled>1526306878081</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_1635efab281:30e373d:2835af05</id><author><name>Giorgia Guglielmi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia’s top-cited scholarly articles — revealed, Published online: 14 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05161-6&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05161-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Gene collections and astronomy studies dominate the list of the most-cited publications with DOIs on the popular online encyclopaedia.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/vOk3-KKu190/s41467-018-04384-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Dual origin of relapses in retinoic-acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>554</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04384-5/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4384_Fig2_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04384-5</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04384-5</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dual origin of relapses in retinoic-acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual origin of relapses in retinoic-acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia, Published online: 24 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04384-5&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04384-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Historical acute promyelocytic leukemia patients treated with retinoic acid and chemotherapy sometimes did relapse.

Food security has always been a focus issue in China. Farmland consolidation (FC) was regarded as a critical way to increase the quantity and improve the quality of farmland to ensure food security by Chinese government. FC projects have been nationwide launched, however few studies focused on evaluating the effectiveness of FC at a national scale. As such, an efficient way to evaluate the effectiveness of FC on improving agricultural productivity in China will be needed and it is critical for future national land consolidation planning. In this study, we selected 7505 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2013 with good quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as samples to evaluate the effectiveness of FC. We used time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI from 2001 to 2013, to extract four indicators to characterize agricultural productivity change of 4442 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2010, i.e., productivity level (PL), productivity variation (PV), productivity potential (PP), and multi-cropping index (MI). On this basis, we further predicted the same four characteristics for 3063 FC projects completed between 2011 and 2013, respectively, using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found FC showed an overall effective status on improving agricultural productivity between 2006 and 2013 in China, especially on upgrading PL and improving PP. The positive effect was more prominent in the southeast and eastern China. It is noteworthy that 27.30% of all the 7505 projects were still ineffective on upgrading PL, the elementary improvement of agricultural productivity. Finally, we proposed that location-specific factors should be taken into consideration for launching FC projects and diverse financial sources are also needed for supporting FC. The results provide a reference for government to arrange FC projects reasonably and to formulate land consolidation planning in a proper way that better improve the effectiveness of FC.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>7c8f279b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198171</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4c:2835af05</id><author><name>Yeting Fan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yeting Fan, Xiaobin Jin, Xiaomin Xiang, Le Gan, Xuhong Yang, Zhihong Zhang, Yinkang Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

Objectives &lt;p&gt;Lipid accumulation product (LAP) is a simple and effective indicator that reflects visceral obesity. This study aimed to compare the significance of LAP in predicting hypertension risk with other obesity indices, and to evaluate the interactive effects of LAP and smoking, family history of hypertension on hypertension risk in Chinese Han adults.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A community based cross-sectional study was performed in Bengbu, China. Participants received face-to-face questionnaire survey, anthropometric tests and laboratory examinations. Relevant indicators that reflect obesity including BMI (body mass index), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and LAP were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the association between LAP and hypertension risk. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC) of LAP, BMI, and WHtR were calculated and then compared. Interactive effect was evaluated by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), attributable proportion due to interaction (AP) and synergy index (SI).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 1777 participants were enrolled, and the prevalence of hypertension was 24.4% (n = 433). There was a significant increase in hypertension risk with LAP levels in the fourth quartile as compared with the bottom quartile (OR: 3.31, 95%CI: 1.76–6.25). The AUC of LAP was significantly different than that of BMI in males (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.158, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0309) and females (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 3.570, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0004), while only performed better in females as compared with that of WHtR (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; = 2.166, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0303). LAP was significantly interacted with family history of hypertension on hypertension risk both in males (RERI: 1.07, 95%CI: 0.09–2.05; AP: 0.33, 95%CI: 0.23–0.44; SI: 1.92, 95%CI: 1.53–2.41) and females (RERI: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.07–1.53; AP: 0.25, 95%CI: 0.11–0.39; SI: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.16–2.19).

Our results also demonstrated interactive effects of LAP with smoking, family history of hypertension on hypertension risk.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1083-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>The long and short of RNA export</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6393/1083.2.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1083-b?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528396622000</published><fingerprint>b6ca38e6</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1083-b?rss=1</link><crawled>1528398419859</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163dba51793:6879dd9:2835af05</id><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId><title>Science current issue</title></origin><title>Mycobacteria and metabolism</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/748.2.full</canonicalUrl><visual><url>none</url></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-b?rss=1</originId><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526578752000</published><fingerprint>609c49ab</fingerprint><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/748-b?rss=1</link><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395c5:3dd877af</id><author><name>Fogg, C.

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of phosphorus (P) restriction on the deleterious effects of high fat diets on mineral metabolism. Twenty-four rats were allotted to 3 groups (n = 8 each) that were fed different diets for 7 months. Rats in group 1 were fed normal fat-normal P (0.6%) diet (NF-NP), rats in group 2 were fed high fat- normal P diet (HF-NP) and rats in group 3 were fed high fat-low P (0.2%) diet (HF-LP). Blood, urine and tissues were collected at the end of the experiments. When compared with the control group (NF-NP), rats fed HF diets showed increases in body weight, and in plasma concentrations of triglycerides and leptin, and decreased plasma calcitriol concentrations. In rats fed HF-NP plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) was higher (279.6±39.4 pg/ml vs 160.6±25.0 pg/ml, p = 0.018) and renal klotho (ratio klotho/GAPDH) was lower (0.75±0.06 vs 1.06±0.08, p&amp;lt;0.01) than in rats fed NF-NP. Phosphorus restriction did not normalize plasma FGF23 or renal klotho; in fact, rats fed HF-LP, that only ingested an average of 22.9 mg/day of P, had higher FGF23 (214.7±32.4 pg/ml) concentrations than rats fed NF-NP (160.6±25.0 pg/ml), that ingested and average of 74.4 mg/day of P over a 7 month period. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that severe P restriction over a prolonged period of time (7 months) does not normalize the increase in circulating FGF23 induced by HF diets. These data indicate that the deleterious effects of high fat diet on the FGF23/klotho axis are not eliminated by reduced P intake.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>4accc782</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198481</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84556:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Rafael Rios</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael Rios, Carmen Pineda, Ignacio Lopez, Juan Muñoz-Castañeda, Mariano Rodriguez, Escolastico Aguilera-Tejero, Ana I.

Muscle morphogenesis is tightly coupled with that of motor neurons (MNs). Both MNs and muscle progenitors simultaneously explore the surrounding tissues while exchanging reciprocal signals to tune their behaviors. We previously identified the Fat1 cadherin as a regulator of muscle morphogenesis and showed that it is required in the myogenic lineage to control the polarity of progenitor migration. To expand our knowledge on how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; exerts its tissue-morphogenesis regulator activity, we dissected its functions by tissue-specific genetic ablation. An emblematic example of muscle under such morphogenetic control is the cutaneous maximus (CM) muscle, a flat subcutaneous muscle in which progenitor migration is physically separated from the process of myogenic differentiation but tightly associated with elongating axons of its partner MNs. Here, we show that constitutive &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; disruption interferes with expansion and differentiation of the CM muscle, with its motor innervation and with specification of its associated MN pool. &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in muscle progenitors, in associated mesenchymal cells, and in MN subsets, including the CM-innervating pool. We identify mesenchyme-derived connective tissue (CT) as a cell type in which &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; activity is required for the non–cell-autonomous control of CM muscle progenitor spreading, myogenic differentiation, motor innervation, and for motor pool specification. In parallel, &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; is required in MNs to promote their axonal growth and specification, indirectly influencing muscle progenitor progression. These results illustrate how &lt;i&gt;Fat1&lt;/i&gt; coordinates the coupling of muscular and neuronal morphogenesis by playing distinct but complementary actions in several cell types.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jN05gwz7zUk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>ee3c4299</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2004734</link><crawled>1526493856788</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_1636a1fc414:493cd5:abeb7260</id><author><name>Françoise Helmbacher</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Françoise Helmbacher&lt;/p&gt;

Compared to other plasmid classifiers, Plasflow and cBar, it achieves better recall (0.87), specificity (0.99), precision (0.96) and accuracy (0.98) on a dataset of 70 genomes containing plasmids. Finally we tested our method on a dataset of E. coli strains exhibiting an elevated rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase coding gene chromosomal integration, and we were able to identify 20/21 of these events. Moreover virulence genes and operons predicted locations were also in agreement with the literature. Similar approaches could also be developed for other well-characterized bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527663600000</published><fingerprint>7aa8b2f1</fingerprint><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/334805v1?rss=1</link><crawled>1527716642753</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163b301ffc1:2ae69a7:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Royer, G.</name></author><description>Plasmid prediction may be of great interest when studying bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae.

Compared to other plasmid classifiers, Plasflow and cBar, it achieves better recall (0.87), specificity (0.99), precision (0.96) and accuracy (0.98) on a dataset of 70 genomes containing plasmids. Finally we tested our method on a dataset of E. coli strains exhibiting an elevated rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase coding gene chromosomal integration, and we were able to identify 20/21 of these events. Moreover virulence genes and operons predicted locations were also in agreement with the literature. Similar approaches could also be developed for other well-characterized bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId><title>PLOS ONE</title></origin><title>Design of a glutamine substrate tag enabling protein labelling mediated by &amp;lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&amp;lt;/i&gt; transglutaminase</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</canonicalUrl><unread>True</unread><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197956</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;by Samuel K.

Transglutaminases (TGases) are enzymes that catalyse protein cross-linking through a transamidation reaction between the side chain of a glutamine residue on one protein and the side chain of a lysine residue on another. Generally, TGases show low substrate specificity with respect to their amine substrate, such that a wide variety of primary amines can participate in the modification of specific glutamine residue. Although a number of different TGases have been used to mediate these bioconjugation reactions, the TGase from &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (bTG) may be particularly suited to this application. It is smaller than most TGases, can be expressed in a soluble active form, and lacks the calcium dependence of its mammalian counterparts. However, little is known regarding this enzyme and its glutamine substrate specificity, limiting the scope of its application. In this work, we designed a FRET-based ligation assay to monitor the bTG-mediated conjugation of the fluorescent proteins Clover and mRuby2. This assay allowed us to screen a library of random heptapeptide glutamine sequences for their reactivity with recombinant bTG in bacterial cells, using fluorescence assisted cell sorting. From this library, several reactive sequences were identified and kinetically characterized, with the most reactive sequence (YAHQAHY) having a k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19 ± 3 μM&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Phylogeny of hard ticks (Ixodidae) remains unresolved. Mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) are increasingly used to resolve phylogenetic controversies, but remain unavailable for the entire large &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; genus. &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma asiaticum&lt;/i&gt; is a parasitic tick distributed throughout the Asia. As a result of great morphological variability, two subspecies have been recognised historically; until a morphological data-based synonymization was proposed. However, this hypothesis was never tested using molecular data. Therefore, objectives of this study were to: 1. sequence the first &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt; mitogenome; 2. scrutinise the proposed synonymization using molecular data, i.e. complete mitogenomes of both subspecies: &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiaticum and kozlovi&lt;/i&gt;; 3. conduct phylogenomic and comparative analyses of all available Ixodidae mitogenomes. Results corroborate the proposed synonymization: the two mitogenomes are almost identical (99.6%). Genomic features of both mitogenomes are standard for Metastriata; which includes the presence of two control regions and all three &amp;quot;Tick-Box&amp;quot; motifs. Gene order and strand distribution are perfectly conserved for the entire Metastriata group. Suspecting compositional biases, we conducted phylogenetic analyses (29 almost complete mitogenomes) using homogeneous and heterogeneous (CAT) models of substitution. The results were congruent, apart from the deep-level topology of prostriate ticks (&lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;): the homogeneous model produced a monophyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt;, but the CAT model produced a paraphyletic &lt;i&gt;Ixodes&lt;/i&gt; (and thereby Prostriata), divided into Australasian and non-Australasian clades. This topology implies that all metastriate ticks have evolved from the ancestor of the non-Australian branch of prostriate ticks. Metastriata was divided into three clades: 1. Amblyomminae and Rhipicephalinae (&lt;i&gt;Rhipicephalus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hyalomma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dermacentor&lt;/i&gt;); 2. Haemaphysalinae and Bothriocrotoninae, plus &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma sphenodonti&lt;/i&gt;; 3. &lt;i&gt;Amblyomma elaphense&lt;/i&gt;, basal to all Metastriata. We conclude that mitogenomes have the potential to resolve the long-standing debate about the evolutionary history of ticks, but heterogeneous evolutionary models should be used to alleviate the effects of compositional heterogeneity on deep-level relationships.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>225c896c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197524</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7bf:2835af05</id><author><name>Zhi-Qiang Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zhi-Qiang Liu, Yan-Feng Liu, Nuer Kuermanali, Deng-Feng Wang, Shi-Jun Chen, Hui-Ling Guo, Li Zhao, Jun-Wei Wang, Tao Han, Yuan-Zhi Wang, Jie Wang, Chen-Feng Shen, Zhuang-Zhi Zhang, Chuang-Fu Chen&lt;/p&gt;

Many implementations of pooled screens in mammalian cells rely on linking an element of interest to a barcode, with the latter subsequently quantitated by next generation sequencing. However, substantial uncoupling between these paired elements during lentiviral production has been reported, especially as the distance between elements increases. We detail that PCR amplification is another major source of uncoupling, and becomes more pronounced with increased amounts of DNA template molecules and PCR cycles. To lessen uncoupling in systems that use paired elements for detection, we recommend minimizing the distance between elements, using low and equal template DNA inputs for plasmid and genomic DNA during PCR, and minimizing the number of PCR cycles. We also present a vector design for conducting combinatorial CRISPR screens that enables accurate barcode-based detection with a single short sequencing read and minimal uncoupling.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527282000000</published><updated>1527282000000</updated><fingerprint>6dd023e8</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197547</link><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mudra Hegde</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mudra Hegde, Christine Strand, Ruth E.

Xenon is frequently used as a general anesthetic in humans, but the mechanism remains an issue of debate. While for some membrane proteins, a direct interaction of xenon with the protein has been shown to be the inhibitory mechanism, other membrane protein functions could be affected by changes of membrane properties due to partitioning of the gas into the lipid bilayer. Here, the effect of xenon on a mechanosensitive ion channel and a copper ion-translocating ATPase was compared under different conditions. Xenon inhibited spontaneous gating of the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; mechano-sensitive mutant channel MscL-G22E, as shown by patch-clamp recording techniques. Under high hydrostatic pressure, MscL-inhibition was reversed. Similarly, the activity of the &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus hirae&lt;/i&gt; CopB copper ATPase, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, was inhibited by xenon. However, the CopB ATPase activity was also inhibited by xenon when CopB was in a solubilized state. These findings suggest that xenon acts by directly interacting with these proteins, rather than &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; indirect effects by altering membrane properties. Also, inhibition of copper transport may be a novel effect of xenon that contributes to anesthesia.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>ab5b7851</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198110</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b782:3dd877af</id><author><name>Evgeny Petrov</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Evgeny Petrov, Gopalakrishnan Menon, Paul R.

The PRDS measures individual differences in people’s tendencies to feel resentful about what they have compared to what other people like them have.

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive type of soft tissue tumor that is associated with high rates of metastasis. In the present study, we found that CPI-613, which targets tumorous mitochondrial energy metabolism, induced autophagosome formation followed by lysosome fusion in HS-MM CCS cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, CPI-613 along with chloroquine, which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, significantly induced necrosis of HS-MM CCS cell growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Subsequently, we established a murine orthotropic metastatic model of CCS and evaluated the putative suppressive effect of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on CCS progression. Injection of HS-MM into the aponeuroses of the thigh, the most frequently affected site in CCS, resulted in massive metastasis in SCID-beige mice. By contrast, intraperitoneal administration of CPI-613 (25 mg/kg) and chloroquine (50 mg/kg), two days a week for two weeks, significantly decreased tumor growth at the injection site and abolished metastasis. The present results imply the inhibitory effects of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on the progression of CCS.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>f180d6ab</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198940</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b322:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Yuki Egawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Egawa, Chiemi Saigo, Yusuke Kito, Toshiaki Moriki, Tamotsu Takeuchi&lt;/p&gt;

To establish 24-h urinary creatinine excretion reference ranges based on anthropometry in healthy Chinese children, a cross-sectional survey was conducted using twice-sampled 24-h urine and anthropometric variables. Age- and sex-specific 24-h creatinine excretion reference ranges (crude and related to individual anthropometric variables) were derived. During October 2013 and May 2014, urine samples were collected. Anthropometric variables were measured in the first survey. Data of 710 children (377 boys and 333 girls) aged 8–13 years who completed the study were analyzed. No significant difference was observed in 24-h urine volumes between the two samples (median [interquartile range): 855.0 [600.0–1272.0) mL vs. 900.0 [660.0–1220.0) mL, P = 0.277). The mean 24-h urine creatinine excretion was regarded as representative of absolute daily creatinine excretion in children. Sex-specific, body-weight-adjusted creatinine excretion reference values were 15.3 mg/kg/day (0.1353 mmol/kg/day) for boys and 14.3 mg/kg/day (0.1264 mmol/kg/day) for girls. Differences were significant between boys and girls within the same age group but not across different age groups within the same sex. Ideal 24-h creatinine excretion values for height were derived for potential determination of the creatinine height index. These data can serve as reference ranges to calculate ratios of analyte to creatinine. The creatinine height index can be used to assess somatic protein status.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>1d934016</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197672</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f232f:2835af05</id><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Wei Wang, Cong Du, Laixiang Lin, Wen Chen, Long Tan, Jun Shen, Elizabeth N.

Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) producing carbapenemases are increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid confirmation of carbapenemase type will be an important diagnostic step in clinical microbiology laboratories not only to reduce the risk of transmissions but also for optimising antibiotic therapy in the future. We compared diagnostic reliability of two commercially available molecular assays (Check-Direct CPE vs. AID line probe assay) for detection and typing of carbapenemase genes in 80 well-characterized isolates of MDR-GNB. Respective strains were isolated in various clinical specimens at our clinical microbiology laboratory. The reference standard included confirmation of carbapenemase-production at the molecular level at the German National Reference Laboratory for Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany). 53 &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; and 27 members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex were used in this study. The tested assays appeared highly reliable to confirm carbapenemase-producing &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (CPE) with respective sensitivities of 97.7%, but are currently unsuitable for analysis of members of the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;baumannii&lt;/i&gt;-complex. Both assays are easy to perform and rapid tools for confirmation and typing of the most common carbapenemase genes in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;.

Enzastaurin is a Protein Kinase C-β selective inhibitor that was developed to treat cancers. Protein Kinase C-β is an important enzyme for a variety of neuronal functions; in particular, previous rodent studies have reported deficits in spatial and fear-conditioned learning and memory with lower levels of Protein Kinase C-β. Due to Enzastaurin’s mechanism of action, the present study investigated the consequences of Enzastaurin exposure on learning and memory in 12-month-old Fischer-344 male rats. Rats were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or Enzastaurin, and behaviorally tested using the spatial reference memory Morris Water Maze. Rats treated with Enzastaurin exhibited decreased overnight retention and poorer performance on the latter testing day, indicating a mild, but significant, memory impairment. There were no differences during the probe trial indicating that all animals were able to spatially localize the platform to the proper quadrant by the end of testing. RNA isolated from the hippocampus was analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina). No statistically significant transcriptional differences were noted. Our findings suggest that acute Enzastaurin treatment can impair hippocampal-based learning and memory performance, with no effects on transcription in the hippocampus. We propose that care should be taken in future clinical trials that utilize Protein Kinase C-ß inhibitors, to monitor for possible cognitive effects, future research should examine if these effects are fully reversible.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528232400000</published><updated>1528232400000</updated><fingerprint>511e74f7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198256</link><crawled>1528220521821</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d10a955d:55f5bc6:3dd877af</id><author><name>Mari N.

Heavy clay soils are globally widespread but their poor drainage and poor aeration limit their use for agriculture. This study was designed to test the effect of the amendment of biochar (BC) from woody shrubs on drainage/saturated hydraulic conductivity (K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;), soil aeration/air capacity, available water capacity and biomass and grain yields of maize. In a field experiment, BC from &lt;i&gt;Gliricidia sepium&lt;/i&gt; was applied in planting basins or rip lines at 2.5% and 5% w/w in addition to a control without BC. The maize biomass and grain yields were higher in BC treated plots compared to control (p&amp;lt;0.05) during the 2012 and 2013 seasons. There was no significant difference in the yields between 2.5% and 5% BC treatments (e.g. grain yield were 6.6 and 8.1 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 9.3 and 10.3 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2013 compared to control with 4.2 and 6.7 t ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2012 and 2013, respectively). Soil from the same field site was also mixed with a similar woody shrub BC from &lt;i&gt;Eupatorium adenophorum&lt;/i&gt; in the laboratory at rates of 2.5%, 5% and 10% BC w/w and a control without BC. The mixtures were then incubated and subjected to two wet-dry cycles for two weeks. Core samples were taken from the incubated soil and tested for bulk density, K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and pF measurements. Total porosity and moisture at field capacity and wilting point were 72.3%, 43.7% and 23.7%, respectively, and not affected by BC amendment (p&gt;0.05). In contrast, bulk density decreased linearly by 0.011±0.002 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; per percent BC added (p&amp;lt;0.001). K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity of the soil were 288 cm day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 30.9%, respectively falling within the generally accepted optimal range. Both K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity followed a significant quadratic relation (p&amp;lt;0.05) upon BC addition, decreasing at low BC doses, reaching a minimum at 3–5% BC and increasing at higher doses. Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526072400000</published><updated>1526072400000</updated><fingerprint>b1ebe2f3</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0196794</link><crawled>1526060525678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163504ba86e:1e04f69:2835af05</id><author><name>Alfred Obia</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Alfred Obia, Jan Mulder, Sarah Elizabeth Hale, Neneng Laela Nurida, Gerard Cornelissen&lt;/p&gt;

Results allowed a partial attribution of the yield increases to changes in soil physical properties such as changes in bulk density and not clearly to K&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt; and air capacity.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05192-z</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>Why dinosaurs arranged their eggs in a doughnut shape</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05192-z/d41586-018-05192-z_15764440.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05192-z</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why dinosaurs arranged their eggs in a doughnut shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why dinosaurs arranged their eggs in a doughnut shape, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05192-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05192-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A 1,600-kilogram brooding parent could be a danger to developing offspring.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>65</engagement><published>1526454000000</published><fingerprint>5c022952</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05192-z</link><crawled>1526481160855</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163695e0a97:4274f6c:2835af05</id><author><name>NA</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why dinosaurs arranged their eggs in a doughnut shape&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why dinosaurs arranged their eggs in a doughnut shape, Published online: 16 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05192-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05192-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;A 1,600-kilogram brooding parent could be a danger to developing offspring.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/8WZxYdKiu8M/s41467-018-04188-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into restricted myeloid progenitors before cell division in mice</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1882</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04188-7/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4188_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>2549</height><contentType>application/octet-stream</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04188-7</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04188-7</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into restricted myeloid progenitors before cell division in mice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into restricted myeloid progenitors before cell division in mice, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04188-7&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04188-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dependence of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate on the phase of the cell cycle has not been demonstrated in vivo.

Specifically, the monoploid Li and Stephens model and its variants are linear in reference panel size unless heuristic approximations are used. However, sequencing projects numbering in the thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals are underway, and others numbering in the millions are anticipated.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph.

DST was sensitive to environmental temperature and showed lower nocturnal values in CFS/ME patients than controls only in winter.

These findings suggest that circadian regulation and skin vasodilator responses may play a role in CFS/ME.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>e73d25aa</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198106</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f4a:2835af05</id><author><name>Trinitat Cambras</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Trinitat Cambras, Jesús Castro-Marrero, Maria Cleofé Zaragoza, Antoni Díez-Noguera, José Alegre&lt;/p&gt;
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph. However, daily activity, the relative amplitude and the stability of the activity rhythm were lower in CFS/ME patients than in controls. DST was sensitive to environmental temperature and showed lower nocturnal values in CFS/ME patients than controls only in winter. A spectral analysis showed no differences in phase or amplitude of the 24h rhythm, but the power of the second harmonic (12h), revealed differences between groups (controls showed a post-lunch dip in activity and peak in DST, while CFS/ME patients did not) and correlated with clinical features. These findings suggest that circadian regulation and skin vasodilator responses may play a role in CFS/ME.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6076.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Triplets, birthweight, and handedness [Psychological and Cognitive Sciences]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6076</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/23.cover-source.jpg?itok=hDICGGTS</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/6076.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>The mechanisms behind handedness formation in humans are still poorly understood.

Ferroptosis is a cell death process driven by damage to cell membranes and linked to numerous human diseases. Ferroptosis is caused by loss of activity of the key enzyme that is tasked with repairing oxidative damage to cell membranes—glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 normally removes the dangerous products of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, protecting cell membranes from this type of damage; when GPX4 fails, ferroptosis ensues. Ferroptosis is distinct from apoptosis, necroptosis, necrosis, and other modes of cell death. Several key mysteries regarding how cells die during ferroptosis remain unsolved. First, the drivers of lipid peroxidation are not yet clear. Second, the subcellular location of lethal lipid peroxides remains an outstanding question. Finally, how exactly lipid peroxidation leads to cell death is an unsolved mystery. Answers to these questions will provide insights into the mechanisms of ferroptotic cell death and associated human diseases, as well as new therapeutic strategies for such diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LCHMnGYG4g0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>1</engagement><published>1527195600000</published><updated>1527195600000</updated><fingerprint>e4a45b7a</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2006203</link><crawled>1527183909217</crawled><id>GQ68GDDK1puoZR/5r34tuQkf5vYz/+d21QfBV88/rnw=_16393412161:65298:d63e3ae2</id><author><name>Huizhong Feng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Huizhong Feng, Brent R.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526590800000</published><updated>1526590800000</updated><fingerprint>4585a5bf</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006156</link><crawled>1526580501938</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_1636f49ddb2:4e2d26:abeb7260</id><author><name>Milad Hobbi Mobarhan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Many experimental and polymer modeling efforts are dedicated to deciphering the mechanistic principles behind chromosome folding. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers. The main challenges are therefore to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate properly the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. Here, we develop a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Accounting accurately for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density, we show that our simulation scheme not only captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system but also tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining. This strategy allows a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and offers a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and to go beyond the current limitations by studying long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics. We use our formalism to investigate in details the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527627600000</published><updated>1527627600000</updated><fingerprint>881dfb5f</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006159</link><crawled>1527615681306</crawled><id>dr8pjQGwW0OGu3B6mPW+uLGvtmW9y66ELGS9t7Ivrm4=_163acfd731a:122df7:ed160cc3</id><author><name>Surya K.

We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduce experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predict that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YYb8ENLLah4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/Cdu7QsLgK3E/acs.jpcb.8b01646</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Host Cell Prediction of Exosomes Using Morphological Features on Solid Surfaces Analyzed by Machine Learning</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01646/20180531/images/medium/jp-2018-016466_0010.gif</url><height>245</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01646</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01646</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b01646/20180531/images/medium/jp-2018-016466_0010.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b01646&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is usually a reliable technique to find the binding sites of a transcription factor. In the current study, we developed a suitable ChIP method using developing castor bean seeds. A castor bean seed with large and persistent endosperm contains high amounts of storage lipids (ca. 50–60%) and is often considered as a model material to studying seed biology. In oleaginous seeds, due to the rich oils which could seriously affect immunoprecipitation and DNA isolation, it is often difficult to carry out a successful ChIP experiment. Thus, the development of an efficient ChIP method for oleaginous seeds is required. In this study, we modified different steps, including tissue preparation for cross-linking, chromatin washing, sonication and immunoprecipitation of other existing methods. As exemplified by the targeted gene identification of a master regulator WRI1, which regulates fatty acid biosynthesis, we found that the improved ChIP method worked well. We analyzed percentage input and fold changes of the ChIPed DNA. We also made successful ChIP-seq libraries using this method. This method provides a technical support not only for use on castor bean seeds; it might be used equally to analyze protein-DNA interaction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in other oleaginous seeds.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>1849e939</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197126</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506d:2835af05</id><author><name>Mohammad Enamul Haque</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mohammad Enamul Haque, Bing Han, Bin Wang, Yue Wang, Aizhong Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Written communication plays a crucial role in the history of modern civilizations as manuscripts do not only exist contemporarily, but are passed on to subsequent generations. Besides a document’s content, information is stored in the materials used for its production. Analyses of the composition allow, for example, identifying the biological origins of materials, dating, and help to understand degradation patterns. A combination of microscopic and DNA approaches was applied in order to analyze various plant derived writing sheets. Given their diversity and abundance in museum collections, plant based writing supports are yet an underexplored target for DNA studies. DNA retrieval of paper is low compared to raw paper plant material, which is likely due to the loss of organic components during paper production. Optimizing DNA extraction for each respective material drastically increased DNA recovery. Finally, we present a non-invasive DNA sampling method that utilizes nylon membranes, commonly used for bacterial DNA sampling and that is applicable to delicate material. Although bacterial infestation was visible on one sample, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy, endogenous DNA was retrieved. The results presented here are promising as they extend the scope of sources for DNA analyses by demonstrating that DNA molecules can be retrieved from a variety of plant derived writing supports. In future, such analyses can help to explore the biological diversity not only of plants and of additives utilized for producing writing supports, but also of the plenty products made from paper.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>d61eb8c</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198513</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f51:2835af05</id><author><name>Anna Schulz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Schulz, Silke Lautner, Jörg Fromm, Markus Fischer&lt;/p&gt;

Acute post-operative pain can remain untreated if patients cannot express themselves. The perfusion index (PI) may decrease when pain activates sympathetic tone and may increase after analgesics are administered. We evaluated if the perfusion index is a feasible indicator for objectively assessing pain relief in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and calculated the changes in PI measurements at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements to examine if the PI is a useful criterion for discharging patients from the postanesthesia care unit. This retrospective observational study enrolled female patients who were admitted for gynecological or general surgery. The patients received general anesthesia and were admitted to the postanesthesia care unit. The PI, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded before and after administration of intravenous morphine. Changes in these parameters before and after analgesics were administered and the difference of these parameters between age and BMI subgroups were compared. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and %ΔPI and %ΔVAS were also evaluated. The percentage change in ΔPI (P9-T0/T0) of the patients at the time of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit relative to baseline PI measurements was calculated. Eighty patients were enrolled, and there were 123 instances during which analgesia was required. Heart rate, PI, and VAS score were significantly different before and after analgesics were administered (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The difference of parameters between age and BMI subgroups were not significant. The correlation between the PI and VAS score, ΔPI and ΔVAS, and the percentage change in ΔPI and ΔVAS showed weak correlations in age, BMI subgroups, and all measurements. The baseline PI and the PI when arriving at and when being discharged from the postanesthesia care unit were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The mean percentage change in Δ PI at the time of discharge from the PACU was 66.2%, and the 99% confidence interval was 12.2%~120.3%. The perfusion index was increased, and the VAS score was decreased significantly after analgesics were administered, but the correlation was weak in each subgroup. The VAS score is a subjective and psychometric parameter. The PI increased when partial pain relief was achieved after morphine was administered but did not reflect pain intensity or changes in the VAS score regardless of age or BMI. A percentage change in ΔPI at the time of discharge from the PACU relative to baseline PI measurements of greater than 12% can be used as a supplemental objective discharge criterion for pain assessment in the postanesthesia care unit.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526504400000</published><updated>1526504400000</updated><fingerprint>c2c2f590</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197630</link><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7c7:2835af05</id><author><name>Chun-Lin Chu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Chun-Lin Chu, Yi-You Huang, Ying-Hou Chen, Ling-Ping Lai, Huei-Ming Yeh&lt;/p&gt;

Genus &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus&lt;/i&gt; has a wide distribution in North Africa and in the Middle East. In the present study, we modeled the habitat suitability of two Omani species of the genus (&lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudotrapelus jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt;) to evaluate the potential effects of climate change on their distribution. Mean diurnal range and precipitation of wettest quarter are the most highly contributed variables for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The potential distribution for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dhofarensis&lt;/i&gt; in the current time covers the southern coastal regions of Oman, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, and Socotra Island, but the suitable regions were reduced in the future prediction and limited to Yemen, Socotra Island, and Oman. There have not been any records of the species outside of Oman. Analysis of habitat suitability for &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;jensvindumi&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the species is restricted to the Al Hajar Mountain of Oman and the southeast coastal region of Iran, but there are no records of the species from Iran. Because mean diurnal range will not be influenced by climate change in future, the potential distribution of the species is not expected to be changed in 2050. All predicted models were performed with the highest AUC (more than 0.97) using the Maxent method. Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527714000000</published><updated>1527714000000</updated><fingerprint>1543c774</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197884</link><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb915:3dd877af</id><author><name>Iman Rounaghi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Iman Rounaghi, Seyyed Saeed Hosseinian Yousefkhani&lt;/p&gt;

Investigation to find unknown populations of these two species in Iran, Yemen, and Socotra Island is essential for developing conservation programs in the future.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~3/Za9VfSXdeP8/s41598-018-26304-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title></origin><title>Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>612</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-018-26304-9/MediaObjects/41598_2018_26304_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><height>685</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526972400000</published><fingerprint>73e96e44</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9</link><crawled>1526980668897</crawled><id>IymvE54Z9frpyk64iS4s0A80Qs78uuAlkaJGfGCL8/g=_1638723ede1:6bed1e2:93d646dc</id><author><name>Pol Sopeña</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks, Published online: 22 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26304-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26304-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Spraying dynamics in continuous wave laser printing of conductive inks&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/srep/rss/current/~4/Za9VfSXdeP8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5154.short?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title></origin><title>Mapping cortical brain asymmetry in 17,141 healthy individuals worldwide via the ENIGMA Consortium [Neuroscience]</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5154</canonicalUrl><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>359</width><url>http://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/highwire/pnas/115/22.cover-source.jpg?itok=b6MBtk2B</url><height>480</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5154.short?rss=1</originId><content><content>Hemispheric asymmetry is a cardinal feature of human brain organization.

investigate and manipulate nanocolloids.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/26p0wViYm1g/acs.biochem.8b00144</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Tyr51: Key Determinant of the Low Thermostability of the Colwellia psychrerythraea Cold-Shock Protein</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00144/20180518/images/medium/bi-2018-00144g_0011.gif</url><height>194</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00144</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00144</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00144/20180518/images/medium/bi-2018-00144g_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00144&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Modifiable risk factors such as smoking and sedentary lifestyle adversely affect multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Few multimodal behavioural interventions have been conducted for people with MS, and follow-up beyond 1 year is rare for lifestyle interventions. This study assessed adoption and adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours and health outcomes 3 years after a lifestyle modification intervention, using generalized estimating equation models to account for within-participant correlation over time.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;95 people with MS completed baseline surveys before participating in 5-day MS lifestyle risk-factor modification workshops. 76 and 78 participants completed the 1-year and 3-year follow-up surveys respectively. Mean age at 3-year follow-up was 47 years, 72% were female, most (62.8%) had MS for 5 years or less, and 73% had relapsing remitting MS (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared to baseline, participants reported clinically meaningful increases in physical (mean difference (MD): 8.0, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.2–10.8) and mental health (MD: 9.2, CI: 5.8–12.6) quality of life (QOL) at 1-year, and physical (MD: 8.7, CI: 5.3–12.2) and mental health (MD: 8.0, CI: 4.2–11.8) QOL at 3-year follow-up. There was a small decrease in disability from baseline to 1-year follow-up (MD: 0.9, CI: 0.9,1.0) and to 3-year follow-up (MD: 1.0, CI: 0.9,1.0), which was not clinically meaningful. Of those with RRMS, compared to baseline, fewer had a relapse during the year before 1-year follow-up (OR: 0.1, CI 0.0–0.2) and 3-year follow-up (OR: 0.15, CI 0.06–0.33). Participants’ healthy diet score, the proportion meditating ≥1 hours a week, supplementing with ≥ 5000IU vitamin D daily, and supplementing with omega-3 flaxseed oil increased at 1-year follow-up and was sustained, although slightly lower at 3-year follow-up. However, there was no evidence for a change in physical activity and not enough smokers to make meaningful comparisons. Medication use increased at 1-year follow-up and at 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The results provide evidence that lifestyle risk factor modification is feasible and sustainable over time, in a small self-selected and motivated sample of people with MS. Furthermore, participation in a lifestyle intervention is not associated with a decrease in MS medication use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527109200000</published><updated>1527109200000</updated><fingerprint>ce4d5aaa</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197759</link><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2337:2835af05</id><author><name>Claudia H.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for ≥12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin ≥5 cm and dose &gt;45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin ≥5 cm and a dose &gt;45 Gy showed a favorable outcome.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses ≥45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results.

Enhancer of zest homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase which plays a crucial role in cancer progression by regulation of genes involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, invasion and self-renewal. Activity and biological function of EZH2 are regulated by posttranslational modifications. It is suggested that EZH2 stability may be regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is an enzyme catalyzing the addition of GlcNAc moieties to target proteins. In this study, we determined the impact of OGT on expression of EZH2 target genes &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt;, that are involved in breast cancer progression. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that both EZH2 and OGT are targeted to the promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; and knockdown of EZH2 or OGT affects expression of studied genes in breast non-malignant (MCF10A) and cancer cells (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-231). The results showed that OGT silencing affects EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; promoter but the effect is cell-context dependent. Despite the slight decrease in EZH2 protein level in cells with OGT depletion, EZH2 binding to &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased. Moreover, OGT binding to promoter regions of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; was increased in cells with knockdown of EZH2. Increased expression of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; in cells with OGT deregulation was associated with increased acetylation level of histone H3. The results suggest that OGT is involved in regulation of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; expression but its role is not associated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>effcce7</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198351</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b789:3dd877af</id><author><name>Ewa Forma</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ewa Forma, Paweł Jóźwiak, Piotr Ciesielski, Agnieszka Zaczek, Katarzyna Starska, Magdalena Bryś, Anna Krześlak&lt;/p&gt;

The results suggest that OGT is involved in regulation of &lt;i&gt;FOXA1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FOXC1&lt;/i&gt; expression but its role is not associated with regulation of EZH2 protein stability.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05310-x</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId><title>Nature</title></origin><title>The researchers who study alien linguistics</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05310-x/d41586-018-05310-x_15811192.jpg</url><height>576</height><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05310-x</originId><content><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The researchers who study alien linguistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers who study alien linguistics, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05310-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05310-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature speaks to linguist Sheri Wells-Jensen who co-hosted a workshop about the challenges of communicating with extraterrestrials.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>216</engagement><published>1527836400000</published><fingerprint>40e4272c</fingerprint><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05310-x</link><crawled>1527869916353</crawled><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_163bc24c4c1:39cd08a:2835af05</id><author><name>Davide Castelvecchi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The researchers who study alien linguistics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers who study alien linguistics, Published online: 01 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05310-x&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05310-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Nature speaks to linguist Sheri Wells-Jensen who co-hosted a workshop about the challenges of communicating with extraterrestrials.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/jpcbfk/~3/dhU-hWvrOI0/acs.jpcb.8b02378</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] Unusual Temperature Dependence of Nanoscale Structural Organization in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02378/20180514/images/medium/jp-2018-02378z_0009.gif</url><height>272</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02378</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02378</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02378/20180514/images/medium/jp-2018-02378z_0009.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02378&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Visual impairment is a significant public health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where eye care is predominantly provided at the primary healthcare (PHC) level, known as primary eye care. This study aimed to perform an evaluation of primary eye care services in three districts of South Africa and to assess whether an ophthalmic health system strengthening (HSS) package could improve these services. Baseline surveys were conducted in Cape Winelands District, Johannesburg Health District and Mopani District at 14, 25 and 36 PHC facilities, respectively. Thereafter, the HSS package, comprising group training, individual mentoring, stakeholder engagement and resource provision, was implemented in 20 intervention sites in Mopani District, with the remaining 16 Mopani facilities serving as control sites. At baseline, less than half the facilities in Johannesburg and Mopani had dedicated eye care personnel or sufficient space to measure visual acuity. Although visual acuity charts were available in most facilities, &amp;lt;50% assessed patients at the correct distance. Median score for availability of nine essential drugs was &amp;lt;70%. Referral criteria knowledge was highest in Cape Winelands and Johannesburg, with poor clinical knowledge across all districts. Several HSS interventions produced successful outcomes: compared to control sites there was a significant increase in the proportion of intervention sites with eye care personnel and resources such as visual acuity charts (p = 0.02 and &amp;lt;0.01, respectively). However, engaging with district pharmacists did not improve availability of essential drugs (p = 0.47). Referral criteria knowledge improved significantly in intervention sites (p&amp;lt;0.01) but there was no improvement in clinical knowledge (p = 0.76). Primary eye care in South Africa faces multiple challenges with regard to organisation of care, resource availability and clinical competence. The HSS package successfully improved some aspects of this care, but further development is warranted together with debate regarding the positioning of eye services at PHC level.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1526331600000</published><updated>1526331600000</updated><fingerprint>450d9d2e</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197432</link><crawled>1526319722177</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fbeaec1:3262fda:2835af05</id><author><name>Rivka R.

It is unclear how systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) controls local inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of human MSCs on inflammatory arthritis and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Mice with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) received two intraperitoneal injections of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The clinical and histological features of injected CAIA were then compared with those of non-injected mice. The effect of MSCs on induction of regulatory T cells was examined both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also examined multiple cytokines secreted by peritoneal mononuclear cells, along with migration of MSCs in the presence of stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) and/or regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Sections of CAIA mouse joints and spleen were stained for human anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) to confirm migration of injected human MSCs. The results showed that MSCs alleviated the clinical and histological signs of synovitis in CAIA mice. Peritoneal lavage cells from mice treated with MSCs expressed higher levels of SDF-1α and RANTES than those from mice not treated with MSCs. MSC migration was more prevalent in the presence of SDF-1α and/or RANTES. MSCs induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and expression of FOXP3 mRNA was upregulated in the forepaws of MSC-treated CAIA mice. Synovial and splenic tissues from CAIA mice receiving human MSCs were positive for human ANA, suggesting recruitment of MSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that MSCs migrate into inflamed tissues and directly induce the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which then suppress inflammation. Thus, systemic administration of MSCs may be a therapeutic option for rheumatoid arthritis.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>e7aacaf2</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198740</link><crawled>1528393322447</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db574fcf:668335f:3dd877af</id><author><name>Yoojun Nam</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoojun Nam, Seung Min Jung, Yeri Alice Rim, Hyerin Jung, Kijun Lee, Narae Park, Juryun Kim, Yeonsue Jang, Yong-Beom Park, Sung-Hwan Park, Ji Hyeon Ju&lt;/p&gt;

Initially designed to identify children’s movement impairments in clinical settings, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) is also widely used to evaluate children’s movement in research. Standardised scores on the test are calculated using parametric methods under the assumption of normally-distributed data. In a pilot study with thirty five 8–10 year old children (i.e., in Age Band 2 of the MABC-2), we found that maximal performance was often reached. These ‘ceiling effects’ created distributions of scores that may violate parametric assumptions. Tests of normality, skew, and goodness-of-fit revealed this violation, most clearly on three of the eight sub-tests. A strong deviation from normality was again observed in a sample of 161 children (8–10 years, Experiment 1), however ceiling effects were reduced by modifying the scoring methods, and administering items designed for older children when maximal performance was reached. Experiment 2 (n = 81, 7–10 years) further refined the administration and scoring methods, and again improved the distributions of scores. Despite reducing ceiling effects, scores remained non-parametrically distributed, justifying non-parametric analytic approaches. By randomly and repeatedly resampling from the raw data, we generated non-parametric reference distributions for assigning percentiles to each child’s performance, and compared the results with the standardised scores. Distributions of scores obtained with both parametric and non-parametric methods were skewed, and the methods resulted in different rankings of the same data. Overall, we demonstrate that some MABC-2 item scores are not normally-distributed, and violate parametric assumptions. Changes in administering and scoring may partially address these issues. We propose that resampling or other non-parametric methods are required to create new reference distributions to which an individual child’s performance can be referred. The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1527886800000</published><updated>1527886800000</updated><fingerprint>e819a5fd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198426</link><crawled>1527875290564</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163bc76c5c4:3a84554:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Blandine French</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine French, Nicole J.

The role of the subthalamic nucleus in human locomotion is unclear although relevant, given the troublesome management of gait disturbances with subthalamic deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson’s disease. We investigated the subthalamic activity and inter-hemispheric connectivity during walking in eight freely-moving subjects with Parkinson’s disease and bilateral deep brain stimulation. In particular, we compared the subthalamic power spectral densities and coherence, amplitude cross-correlation and phase locking value between resting state, upright standing, and steady forward walking. We observed a phase locking value drop in the &lt;i&gt;β-&lt;/i&gt;frequency band (≈13-35Hz) during walking with respect to resting and standing. This modulation was not accompanied by specific changes in subthalamic power spectral densities, which was not related to gait phases or to striatal dopamine loss measured with [&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I]N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)nortropane and single-photon computed tomography. We speculate that the subthalamic inter-hemispheric desynchronization in the &lt;i&gt;β-&lt;/i&gt;frequency band reflects the information processing of each body side separately, which may support linear walking.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Epiretinal traction is not responsible only for epiretinal but also intraretinal changes. This study aims to describe structural and vascular intraretinal changes after macular peeling in idiopathic (iERM) vs diabetic ERM (dERM).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective interventional study on forty-two eyes, 23 with iERMs and 19 with dERMs, undergoing ERM-ILM peeling. We performed SD-OCT preoperatively, 1 and 6 months postoperatively to assess central macular thickness (CMT), intraretinal cysts (IC) and/or continuous ectopic inner foveal layers (CEIFL), superficial and deep capillary free zone (CFZ) area on OCT-A. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), as a Müller cells marker, was detected immunohistochemically on ILM specimens, to assess Müller cells iatrogenic damage.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The CEIFLs were significantly more common in iERMs (12 (52.2%) in iERMs vs 2 (10.5%) in dERMs, p = 0.004), whereas ICs in dERMs (6 (26.1%) in iERMs vs 17 (89.5%) in dERMs, p&amp;lt;0.001). Median preoperative and postoperative BCVA was 20/50 [20/40-20/66] and 20/33 [20/25-20/40] in iERMs and 20/100 [20/66-20/200] and 20/50 [20/50-20/66] in dERMs, respectively. Median preoperative and postoperative CMT was 423 [370–488] and 364 [329–382] μm in iERM group and 465 [447–503] and 378 [359–433] μm in dERM group, respectively. The BCVA improvement and reduction of CMT thickness were significant in both groups (p&amp;lt;0.001). The presence of CEIFL was associated with lower BCVA in iERMs. Deep CFZ network significantly increased only in dERMs, passing from 0.34 [0.29–0.42] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; preoperatively to 0.56 [0.46–0.6] mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 6-month follow-up (p&amp;lt;0.001). The GFAP expression was significantly higher in dERMs (p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The intraretinal changes are different in iERMs and dERMs, as increased expression of CEIFLs in iERMs vs ICs in dERMs. The CEIFLs are associated with worse anatomical and functional outcomes in iERMs, whereas GFAP espression in peeled ILMs is higher in dERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1525813200000</published><updated>1525813200000</updated><fingerprint>4fa76ee6</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197065</link><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:475067:2835af05</id><author><name>Mario R.

Although APA is commonly believed to generate beneficial functional diversity and be adaptive, we hypothesize that most genes have one optimal polyadenylation site and that APA is caused largely by deleterious polyadenylation errors.

The protein kinase BRAF is one of the key players in regulating cellular responses to extracellular signals. Somatic mutations of the &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; gene, causing constitutive activation of BRAF, have been found in various types of human cancers such as malignant melanoma, and colorectal cancer. BRAF V600E and V600K, most commonly observed mutations in these cancers, may predict response to targeted therapies. Many techniques suffer from a lack of diagnostic sensitivity in mutation analysis in clinical samples with a low cancer cell percentage or poor-quality fragmented DNA. Here we present allele-specific real-time PCR assay for amplifying 35- to 45-base target sequences in &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; gene. Forward primer designed for BRAF V600E detection is capable of recognizing both types of BRAF V600E mutation, i.e. V600E1 (c.1799T&gt;A) and V600E2 (c.1799_1800delTGinsAA), as well as complex tandem mutation caused by nucleotide changes in codons 600 and 601. We utilized this assay to analyze Thai formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Forty-eight percent of 178 Thai colorectal cancer tissues has &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutation detected by highly sensitive commercial assays. Although these DNA samples contain low overall yield of amplifiable DNA, our newly-developed assay successfully revealed BRAF V600 mutations in 6 of 93 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissues which &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt; mutation was not detected. Ultra-short PCR assay with forward mutation-specific primers is potentially useful to detect BRAF V600 mutations in highly fragmented DNA specimens from cancer patients.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528405200000</published><updated>1528405200000</updated><fingerprint>b6f5f79b</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198795</link><crawled>1528394402297</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163db67c9f9:679b316:7cfe07d6</id><author><name>Nunthawut Chat-Uthai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nunthawut Chat-Uthai, Pichpisith Vejvisithsakul, Sutthirat Udommethaporn, Puttarakun Meesiri, Chetiya Danthanawanit, Yannawan Wongchai, Chinachote Teerapakpinyo, Shanop Shuangshoti, Naravat Poungvarin&lt;/p&gt;

Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains representative of the most widespread species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of &lt;i&gt;Brucella&lt;/i&gt; strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of &lt;i&gt;Brucella melitensis&lt;/i&gt; strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS.

Spatial variation of biodiversity in Caatinga is poorly know and strictly attributed to climatic conditions. We investigated the influence of slags on floristic composition and structure of a shrubby-arboreal community in one of the driest region in Brazil. Chemical and physical analyses of soils were performed in samples of seven plots from savannic formations and from forest formations. Vegetation was characterized floristically and structurally in all plots. Habitats were structurally distinct, and diversity differed between peripheral and non-peripheral areas of slags. Nine of the ninety-seven species identified are reported to (sub)humid biomes. Soils are dominantly shallow, eutrophic and sandy loam. However, soils in the periphery of slags are more developed once paludization, melanization and bioturbation were verified.

J.</name></author><description>The influence of environmental factors on the structure and composition of plant communities in the Caatinga is complex and poorly explored. Spatial variation of biodiversity in Caatinga is poorly know and strictly attributed to climatic conditions. We investigated the influence of slags on floristic composition and structure of a shrubby-arboreal community in one of the driest region in Brazil. Chemical and physical analyses of soils were performed in samples of seven plots from savannic formations and from forest formations. Vegetation was characterized floristically and structurally in all plots. Habitats were structurally distinct, and diversity differed between peripheral and non-peripheral areas of slags. Nine of the ninety-seven species identified are reported to (sub)humid biomes. Soils are dominantly shallow, eutrophic and sandy loam. However, soils in the periphery of slags are more developed once paludization, melanization and bioturbation were verified. Our results suggest that soil fertility did not influence vegetable cover in Caatinga. The cover of plant species considered exclusive of (sub)humid biomes in Brazil extends beyond highlands in the semiarid, associated with high soil organic carbon content and water retention capacity of more developed soils than the typical of the Caatinga.</description></item><item><alternate><item><href>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/acs/bichaw/~3/nLyxTJUiLk4/acs.biochem.8b00127</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><origin><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title></origin><title>[ASAP] The Helicobacter pylori HypA·UreE2 Complex Contains a Novel High-Affinity Ni(II)-Binding Site</title><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>500</width><url>https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00127/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00127x_0008.gif</url><height>245</height><contentType>image/gif; charset=UTF-8</contentType></visual><unread>True</unread><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127</originId><summary><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00127/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00127x_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00127&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is an inflammatory and neuropathic pain disorder characterized by the involvement of the autonomic nervous system with sensory, autonomic, motor, skin, and bone changes. At present, universally accepted consensus criteria for CRPS are not yet established, despite the diagnostic criteria proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Various hypotheses for the pathophysiology of CRPS have been proposed; as a result, current therapeutic modalities are varied. General epidemiological data on CRPS are necessary for effective management. However, recent data on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea are scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and other epidemiological features of CRPS in the general population in Korea. In this study on the epidemiology of CRPS in Korea, population-based medical data acquired from 51,448,491 subscribers to the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed, including the incidence, distribution by the CRPS type, regional distribution, monthly distribution, medical costs, and healthcare resource-utilization. The findings indicated that the incidence of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years in 2015 and was correlated with patient age and sex. CRPS types included type I (63%) and type II (37%); moreover, the number of individuals with CRPS I have shown a growing trend since 2011. There was no monthly distribution, but there was regional variation according to the province. The medical departments managing CRPS I the most were orthopedics, internal medicine, anesthesiology and pain medicine, in order; however, patients with CRPS spent more money per visit in the departments of rehabilitation medicine, and anesthesiology and pain medicine. The incidence rate of CRPS in Korea was 29.0 per 100,000 person-years with an increasing trend, which was correlated with patient age in the 70s and female sex. CRPS type I was more common than CRPS type II; in addition, constant increase in medical expenses, regional imbalance, and differences in medical expense among medical specialties should be considered for early management of patients to reduce the disease burden in Korea. Sharing of knowledge about the diagnostic criteria of CRPS are also needed.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528146000000</published><updated>1528146000000</updated><fingerprint>b0f9d0ed</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198147</link><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b784:3dd877af</id><author><name>Hyungtae Kim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Hyungtae Kim, Cheol-Hyeong Lee, Sung-Hun Kim, Yeon-Dong Kim&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control.

Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-α decreased α-SMA (0.74±0.12, p&amp;lt;0.05) and SM22 (0.54±0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The study provided a highly sensitive method for accurate analysis of trace vitamins from natural products.</content><direction>ltr</direction></content><engagement>0</engagement><published>1528318800000</published><updated>1528318800000</updated><fingerprint>ac5d37dd</fingerprint><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198102</link><crawled>1528306925227</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163d630feab:5f76f49:2835af05</id><author><name>Baolei Fan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Baolei Fan, Jinmao You, Yourui Suo, Chunqi Qian&lt;/p&gt;
