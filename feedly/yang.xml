Infants from an early age have a bias to attend more to faces than non-faces and after 5 months are particularly attentive to fearful faces. We examined the specificity of this “fear bias” in 5-, 7-, and 12-month-old infants (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 269) and 36-month-old children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 191) and whether its development is associated with features of the early rearing environment, specifically maternal anxiety and depression symptoms. Attention dwell times were assessed by measuring the latencies of gaze shifts from a stimulus at fixation to a new stimulus in the visual periphery. In infancy, dwell times were shorter for non-face control stimuli vs. happy faces at all ages, and happy vs. fearful, but not angry, faces at 7 and 12 months. At 36 months, dwell times were shorter for non-faces and happy faces compared to fearful and angry faces. Individual variations in attention dwell times were not associated with mothers’ self-reported depression or anxiety symptoms at either age. The results suggest that sensitivity to fearful faces precedes a more general bias for threat-alerting stimuli in early development. We did not find evidence that the initial manifestation of these biases is related to moderate variations in maternal depression or anxiety symptoms.</content></content><author><name>Jukka M.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use in the United Arab Emirates is among the highest in the region. Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread, but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20,000-person cohort study. During the study pilot, 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire, provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants, using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However, biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data. Tobacco use in this study population was found to be higher than previously thought, especially among women. Misclassification of smoking status was more common than expected. Poly-tobacco use was also very common.

Together, our cryo-EM and electrophysiology studies provide a molecular understanding of the unique gating mechanism of TRPM2.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36409</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics</item></keywords><crawled>1525954924306</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1634a004f12:130e4dc:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256123v2?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Bandyopadhyay, A.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/03/256123</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/256123v2?rss=1</link><title>Lineage space and the propensity of bacterial cells to undergo growth transitions [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>e9f4196a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The molecular makeup of the offspring of a dividing cell gradually becomes phenotypically decorrelated from the parent cell by noise and regulatory mechanisms that amplify phenotypic heterogeneity.

S100A16 is a conserved member of the S100 protein family in mammals. Its upregulation was observed in many tumors and is related to malignant transformation. In this study, we explored the independent prognostic value of &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; in terms of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by performing a retrospective study, using data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Besides, by using deep sequencing data in TCGA-LUAD, we also explored the association between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation and copy number alterations (CNAs). Results showed that the primary LUAD tissues (N = 514) had significantly elevated &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression compared with the normal lung tissues (N = 59). Based on OS data of 502 primary LUAD cases, we found that high &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was correlated with inferior OS. The following univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression was an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS (HR: 1.197, 95%CI: 1.050–1.364, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and RFS (HR: 1.206, 95%CI: 1.045–1.393, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.011). By examining the DNA methylation data in TCGA-LUAD, we found that some &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; DNA CpG sites were generally hypermethylated in normal tissues, but not in LUAD tissues. Regression analysis identified a moderately negative correlation between &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression and its DNA methylation. In comparison, although DNA amplification (+1/+2) was frequent (378/511, 74%) in LUAD patients, it was not associated with increased &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression. Based on findings above, we infer that aberrant &lt;i&gt;S100A16&lt;/i&gt; expression might be modulated by its DNA hypomethylation and serves as an independent prognostic indicator of unfavorable OS and RFS in LUAD.</content></content><author><name>De Chen</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by De Chen, Linjie Luo, Chao Liang&lt;/p&gt;

Although studies from pediatric cancers (largely acute lymphoblastic leukemia) have shown that patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy may experience decreased growth velocity during the treatment phase, no such data exist for retinoblastoma patients treated with systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC). The purpose of this study is to report growth patterns of our retinoblastoma (Rb) population who were treated with OAC in a retrospective, single center (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) review of 341 patients treated between 2006 and 2016. Children who only received OAC were classified as naive; those who were treated initially with systemic chemotherapy and subsequently presented to our center for OAC were termed secondary; and a small group of patients who received single-agent systemic chemotherapy prior to OAC were labeled bridge. For all patients, height and weight were recorded at monthly intervals during OAC (short-term) and then annually during a follow-up period (long-term) up to 3 years after treatment. Excluded from this study were children who received external radiation therapy and those with genetic syndromes, which are independently associated with growth derangements. During OAC, there was no significant difference in growth velocity between the naïve and secondary groups. In either group, number of treatments also did not affect growth rate. Three years after the end of OAC, naïve patients were in the 68&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile by height (95% CI 61.30, 74.63) compared to secondary patients in the 61&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 51.1, 71.47). Both groups were in the same weight percentiles during the first two years of follow-up but at the three-year follow-up period, naïve patients were in the 63&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 57.4, 69.4) and secondary patients were in the 60&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile (95% CI 50.4, 69.7). OAC for retinoblastoma does not appear to impact short-term growth velocity, weight gain during the treatment period or after three years.</content></content><author><name>Sruti S.

Currently, the two main Python packages for trees are Bio.Phylo and DendroPy, but as dataset sizes grow, parsing and manipulating ultra-large trees becomes impractical. Results: This article describes TreeSwift, a Python package for traversing and manipulating trees that does not require any external dependencies, and it then compares its performance against that of Bio.Phylo and DendroPy.

Currently, the two main Python packages for trees are Bio.Phylo and DendroPy, but as dataset sizes grow, parsing and manipulating ultra-large trees becomes impractical. Results: This article describes TreeSwift, a Python package for traversing and manipulating trees that does not require any external dependencies, and it then compares its performance against that of Bio.Phylo and DendroPy.

Individuals often respond differently to the same vaccine; some of this variation may be caused by genetic differences among animals. Our objective was to estimate heritability and identify genomic regions associated with humoral response to an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine in beef cattle. Crossbred beef cattle (n = 651) were vaccinated with a commercially available &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine. Serum was collected at time of initial vaccination (d 0), booster (d 21), and d 56 after initial vaccination. Total antibodies specific to siderophore receptor and porin proteins in the vaccine were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood and genotyped with the bovine GeneSeek Genomic Profiler-High Density 78K or 26K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism BeadChip and imputed to 777,000 SNP genotypes. Heritability was estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using both 1) pedigree and 2) genomic relationships among individuals. Fixed effects were contemporary group, calf age, sex, principal components from SNP genotype data, and pedigree-derived heterozygosity effects. Additive and dominance effects of SNPs were estimated individually while accounting for contemporary group, sex, and the top 20 principal components calculated from the genomic relationship matrix. Heritability of initial response to vaccination (d 21 –d 0) was 0.10 ± 0.175 using pedigree relationships and 0.14 ± 0.149 using genomic relationships, but neither estimate was statistically different from zero. Heritability of booster (d 56 –d 21) and overall (d 56 –d 0) responses were low and not statistically significant from zero. There were no clusters of linked SNP associated with vaccine response, but eight regionally isolated SNPs were significantly associated with initial or overall response to vaccination. Regional genetic variation for initial response to an &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7 vaccine was observed, although overall heritability of this response was not statistically significant from zero.</content></content><author><name>Kara B.

Background &lt;p&gt;Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) remains a major cause of admission and inpatient mortality worldwide in children aged less than 5 years. In this study, we explored SAM prevalence and outcomes in children admitted in 13 Kenyan hospitals participating in a Clinical Information Network (CIN). We also describe their immediate in-patient management.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed data for children aged 1–59 months collected retrospectively from medical records after discharge. Mean, median and ranges were used to summarize pooled and age-specific prevalence and mortality associated with SAM. Documentation of key signs and symptoms (S/S) and performance of indicators of quality of care for selected aspects of the WHO management steps were assessed. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between documented S/S and mortality among SAM patients aged 6–59 months. Loess curves were used to explore performance change over time for indicators of selected SAM management steps.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;5306/54140 (9.8%) children aged 1–59 months admitted with medical conditions in CIN hospitals between December 2013 and November 2016 had SAM. SAM prevalence identified by clinicians and case fatality varied widely across hospitals with median proportion (range) of 10.1% (4.6–18.2%) and 14.8% (6.0–28.6%) respectively. Seventeen variables were associated with increased mortality. Performance change over time of management steps varied across hospitals and across selected indicators but suggests some effect of regular audit and feedback.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Identification of SAM patients, their mortality and adherence to in-patient management recommendations varied across hospitals. An important group of SAM patients are aged less than 6 months.

Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo) in the rat is a widely used animal model of vascular dementia and a valuable tool for preclinical pharmacological drug testing, although the varying degrees of acute focal ischemic lesions it induces could interfere with its translational value. Recently, a modification to the BCCAo model, the stepwise occlusion of the two carotid arteries, has been introduced. To acquire objective translatable measures, we used longitudinal multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the effects of semi-chronic (8 days) donepezil treatment in this model, with half of the Wistar rats receiving the treatment one week after the stepwise BCCAo. With an ultrahigh field MRI, we measured high-resolution anatomy, diffusion tensor imaging, cerebral blood flow measurements and functional MRI in response to whisker stimulation, to evaluate both the structural and functional effects of the donepezil treatment and stepwise BCCAo up to 5 weeks post-occlusion. While no large ischemic lesions were detected, atrophy in the striatum and in the neocortex, along with widespread white matter microstructural changes, were found. Donepezil ameliorated the transient drop in the somatosensory BOLD response in distant cortical areas, as detected 2 weeks after the occlusion but the drug had no effect on the long term structural changes. Our results demonstrate a measurable functional MRI effect of the donepezil treatment and the importance of diffusion MRI and voxel based morphometry (VBM) analysis in the translational evaluation of the rat BCCAo model.</content></content><author><name>Gabriella Nyitrai</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gabriella Nyitrai, Tamás Spisák, Zsófia Spisák, Dávid Gajári, Pálma Diószegi, Tamás Zsigmond Kincses, András Czurkó&lt;/p&gt;

We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining lipid homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate lipid mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;To investigate the thickness of retinal layers and association with final visual acuity using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in macular area of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients after a successful macular re-attachment.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In retrospective study, a total 24 eyes with macula-off RRD were enrolled. All patients underwent vitrectomy to repair RRD. Outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor layer (PR), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) thicknesses were measured by the Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) SD-OCT with automated segmentation software. The relationship between the thicknesses of each retinal layer and postoperative logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution scale (LogMAR) visual acuity was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;OPL and RPE thicknesses were not significantly different between the retinal detachment eyes and fellow eyes (P = 0.839, 0.999, respectively). The ONL and photoreceptor thickness were significantly thinner in the retinal detachment eyes (P &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.001, respectively). In the univariate regression analysis, preoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), ONL thickness and photoreceptor thickness showed association with the postoperative BCVA (P = 0.003, &amp;lt;0.001 and 0.024, respectively). In final multiple linear regression model, ONL thickness was the only variable significantly associated with postoperative BCVA (P = 0.044).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Segmented ONL and photoreceptor thickness of retinal detachment eyes were significantly thinner than fellow eyes.

Our investigation links molecular events to cellular functions by demonstrating how SRSF3 regulates the pluripotency genes and uncovers SRSF3-RNA interactions as a critical means to coordinate gene expression during reprogramming, stem cell self-renewal and early development.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37419</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item><item>Developmental Biology and Stem Cells</item></keywords><crawled>1525866866606</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_16344c0a7ae:ae430d:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0023-9</originId><origin><title>Nature Medicine - Issue - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/nm/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Sara Mainardi</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>485</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-018-0023-9/MediaObjects/41591_2018_23_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>848</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0023-9</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0023-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>SHP2 is required for growth of KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo</title><fingerprint>3d34a71</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHP2 is required for growth of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHP2 is required for growth of &amp;lt;i&gt;KRAS&amp;lt;/i&gt;-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0023-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0023-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Combined inhibition of SHP2 and MEK is an effective therapeutic approach in non-small-cell lung cancer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/mbTag3ZIfgA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1527490800000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SHP2 is required for growth of &lt;i&gt;KRAS&lt;/i&gt;-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHP2 is required for growth of &amp;lt;i&gt;KRAS&amp;lt;/i&gt;-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer in vivo, Published online: 28 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0023-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41591-018-0023-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Combined inhibition of SHP2 and MEK is an effective therapeutic approach in non-small-cell lung cancer.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~4/mbTag3ZIfgA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nm/rss/current/~3/mbTag3ZIfgA/s41591-018-0023-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527520035470</crawled><id>PYzmD3sAat15lWWcVxLHD9ulNM95ZfBPY1sahR81ofI=_163a74a028e:1847864:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198513</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1528318800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1528318800000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198513</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198513</link><title>Not stealing from the treasure chest (or just a bit): Analyses on plant derived writing supports and non-invasive DNA sampling</title><fingerprint>d61eb8c</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Schulz, Silke Lautner, Jörg Fromm, Markus Fischer&lt;/p&gt;
Written communication plays a crucial role in the history of modern civilizations as manuscripts do not only exist contemporarily, but are passed on to subsequent generations. Besides a document’s content, information is stored in the materials used for its production. Analyses of the composition allow, for example, identifying the biological origins of materials, dating, and help to understand degradation patterns. A combination of microscopic and DNA approaches was applied in order to analyze various plant derived writing sheets. Given their diversity and abundance in museum collections, plant based writing supports are yet an underexplored target for DNA studies. DNA retrieval of paper is low compared to raw paper plant material, which is likely due to the loss of organic components during paper production. Optimizing DNA extraction for each respective material drastically increased DNA recovery. Finally, we present a non-invasive DNA sampling method that utilizes nylon membranes, commonly used for bacterial DNA sampling and that is applicable to delicate material. Although bacterial infestation was visible on one sample, as indicated by scanning electron microscopy, endogenous DNA was retrieved. The results presented here are promising as they extend the scope of sources for DNA analyses by demonstrating that DNA molecules can be retrieved from a variety of plant derived writing supports. In future, such analyses can help to explore the biological diversity not only of plants and of additives utilized for producing writing supports, but also of the plenty products made from paper.</content></content><author><name>Anna Schulz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Schulz, Silke Lautner, Jörg Fromm, Markus Fischer&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Both osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) and inflammatory arthritis can lead to osteoarticular structural damage. These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;A total of 83 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a composite reference standard (CRS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 49 out of 83 patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and MGIT 960 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.096, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.413, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Yuan Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuan Li, Wenyun Jia, Guohua Lei, Dan Zhao, Guirong Wang, Shibing Qin&lt;/p&gt;

Matsumoto, Masanori Kasai, Kazuya Tomihara&lt;/p&gt;
Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results. To clarify the effect of estrogen on fear conditioning, we investigated the effects of different doses and durations of estradiol administration on freezing behavior during contextual fear conditioning in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. In Experiment 1, OVX ICR mice received a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either oil vehicle (control, 0.1 ml sesame oil) or varied doses (0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, or 50 μg/0.1 ml) of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (EB). Fear conditioning was conducted two days post-EB treatment, and the mice were tested for the learned fear response the following day. In Experiment 2, OVX female mice received an s.c. implantation of a Silastic capsule (I.D. 1.98 × 20.0 mm) containing either vehicle or varied doses (0.05 μg/0.1 ml, 0.5 μg/0.1 ml, 5 μg/0.1 ml, 50 μg/0.1 ml) of EB. Two weeks after implantation, fear conditioning was conducted. During the tests conducted 24 h after conditioning, the high dose EB group showed longer freezing times in both experiments, and lower locomotor activity compared to the control or lower dose groups. In Experiment 3, serum estradiol concentrations of the mice that were treated like those in Experiment 2, were measured; the serum levels of estradiol increased linearly according to the dose of EB administered. The results suggest that mice treated with a high dose of EB exhibit enhanced fear learning, regardless of treatment duration. As a woman’s vulnerability to emotional disorders increases in the peripregnancy period, during which estrogen levels are high, the results from the high-dose EB groups may be important for understanding the hormonal mechanisms involved in these disorders.</content></content><author><name>Yui K.

Several studies have reported regulatory effects of estrogens on fear conditioning in female rodents. However, these studies used different doses, durations, and/or administration methods, and reported inconsistent results.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.</content></content><author><name>Jennifer L.

A common goal in data-analysis is to sift through a large data-matrix and detect any significant submatrices (i.e., biclusters) that have a low numerical rank. We present a simple algorithm for tackling this biclustering problem. Our algorithm accumulates information about 2-by-2 submatrices (i.e., ‘loops’) within the data-matrix, and focuses on rows and columns of the data-matrix that participate in an abundance of low-rank loops. We demonstrate, through analysis and numerical-experiments, that this loop-counting method performs well in a variety of scenarios, outperforming simple spectral methods in many situations of interest. Another important feature of our method is that it can easily be modified to account for aspects of experimental design which commonly arise in practice. For example, our algorithm can be modified to correct for controls, categorical- and continuous-covariates, as well as sparsity within the data. We demonstrate these practical features with two examples; the first drawn from gene-expression analysis and the second drawn from a much larger genome-wide-association-study (GWAS).&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MbY469xyEU0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526330530080</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Aaditya V.

Background &lt;p&gt;Several patients with Parkinson´s disease (PD) can walk normally along straight trajectories, and impairment in their stride length and cadence may not be easily discernible. Do obvious abnormalities occur in these high-functioning patients when more challenging trajectories are travelled, such as circular paths, which normally implicate a graded modulation in the duration of the interlimb gait cycle phases?&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We compared a cohort of well-treated mildly to moderately affected PD patients to a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS), by deliberately including HS spontaneously walking at the same speed of the patients with PD. All participants performed, in random order: linear and circular walking (clockwise and counter-clockwise) at self-selected speed. By means of pressure-sensitive insoles, we recorded walking speed, cadence, duration of single support, double support, swing phase, and stride time. Stride length-cadence relationships were built for linear and curved walking. Stride-to-stride variability of temporal gait parameters was also estimated.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Walking speed, cadence or stride length were not different between PD and HS during linear walking. Speed, cadence and stride length diminished during curved walking in both groups, stride length more in PD than HS. In PD compared to HS, the stride length-cadence relationship was altered during curved walking. Duration of the double-support phase was also increased during curved walking, as was variability of the single support, swing phase and double support phase.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The spatio-temporal gait pattern and variability are significantly modified in well-treated, high-functioning patients with PD walking along circular trajectories, even when they exhibit no changes in speed in straight-line walking. The increased variability of the gait phases during curved walking is an identifying characteristic of PD. We discuss our findings in term of interplay between control of balance and of locomotor progression: the former is challenged by curved trajectories even in high-functioning patients, while the latter may not be critically affected.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Anna Maria Turcato</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna Maria Turcato, Marco Godi, Marica Giardini, Ilaria Arcolin, Antonio Nardone, Andrea Giordano, Marco Schieppati&lt;/p&gt;

We demonstrate the key findings using recent single-cell data and elaborate on the implications for the ability of cells to maintain a narrow size distribution and the emergence of different power laws in these distributions.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/338632v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528157094379</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163cd42c1eb:50cf645:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1526011200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Intracellular Drug Bioavailability: Effect of Neutral Lipids and Phospholipids</title><fingerprint>41f98a3f</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064/20180511/images/medium/mp-2018-000642_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00064&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Flightless saproxylic beetles were selected in order to study the impact of temporal and spatial discontinuity of forests. They were chosen because: (1) they are unable to fly, making them dispersal-limited species, (2) they have a saproxylic diet, which means they are closely linked to the forest, and (3), they have rarely been studied. Forest temporal continuity was expected to be the main factor explaining the presence of these species, modulated by the past and present amount of forest in the surrounding landscape. Twenty-seven forests, distributed into three zones, were sampled in southwestern France. Flightless saproxylic beetles were surveyed using a Winkler extractor and a Berlese funnel. Their presence/absence were modelled using generalised linear mixed models, with zone variable as random effect. Two species showed significant &lt;i&gt;zone&lt;/i&gt; effect and were only or more present in the zone with the highest present forest amount in a 0.5 km radius. In the model that converged, the only selected variable was the past amount of forest in the landscape. The size of the forest, the presence of dead wood and the forest temporal continuity were not included in this model. The importance of the amount of forest in the landscape supports the hypothesis that dispersal-limited species are affected by landscape characteristics. This study demonstrates an important link between the presence of &lt;i&gt;Dienerella clathrata&lt;/i&gt; and the amount of forest in the past, which led to an indicator species analysis being performed.</content></content><author><name>Eugénie Cateau</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eugénie Cateau, Pierre-Alexis Herrault, David Sheeren, Sylvie Ladet, Hervé Brustel&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has previously been demonstrated to accelerate compensatory lung growth (CLG) in mice and may be a useful therapy for pulmonary hypoplasia. Systemic administration of VEGF can result in side effects such as hypotension and edema. The aim of this study was to explore nasal delivery as a route for intrapulmonary VEGF administration. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent left pneumonectomy, followed by daily nasal instillation of VEGF at 0.5 mg/kg or isovolumetric saline. Lung volume measurement, morphometric analysis, and protein expression studies were performed on lung tissues harvested on postoperative day (POD) 4. To understand the mechanism by which VEGF accelerates lung growth, proliferation of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was assessed in a co-culture model with lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) treated with and without VEGF (10 ng/mL). The assay was then repeated with a heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) neutralizing antibody ranging from 0.5–50 μg/mL. Compared to control mice, the VEGF-treated group displayed significantly higher lung volume (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001) and alveolar count (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005) on POD 4. VEGF treatment resulted in increased pulmonary expression of HB-EGF (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02). VEGF-treated HMVEC-L increased HBEC proliferation (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002) while the addition of an HB-EGF neutralizing antibody at 5 and 50 μg/mL abolished this effect (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). These findings demonstrate that nasal delivery of VEGF enhanced CLG. These effects could be mediated by a paracrine mechanism through upregulation of HB-EGF, an epithelial cell mitogen.</content></content><author><name>Duy T.

Global trade and the movement of people accelerate biological invasions by spreading species worldwide. Biosecurity measures seek to allow trade and passenger movements while preventing incursions that could lead to the establishment of unwanted pests, pathogens, and weeds. However, few data exist to evaluate whether changes in trade volumes, passenger arrivals, and biosecurity measures have altered rates of establishment of nonnative species over time. This is particularly true for pathogens, which pose significant risks to animal and plant health and are consequently a major focus of biosecurity efforts but are difficult to detect. Here, we use a database of all known plant pathogen associations recorded in New Zealand to estimate the rate at which new fungal pathogens arrived and established on 131 economically important plant species over the last 133 years. We show that the annual arrival rate of new fungal pathogens increased from 1880 to about 1980 in parallel with increasing import trade volume but subsequently stabilised despite continued rapid growth in import trade and recent rapid increases in international passenger arrivals. Nevertheless, while pathogen arrival rates for crop and pasture species have declined in recent decades, arrival rates have increased for forestry and fruit tree species. These contrasting trends between production sectors reflect differences in biosecurity effort and suggest that targeted biosecurity can slow pathogen arrival and establishment despite increasing trade and international movement of people.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wB5iS5OD44s&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527789489558</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Benjamin A.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Factors associated with one-year mortality after recovery from critical illness are not well understood. Clinicians generally lack information regarding post-hospital discharge outcomes of patients from the intensive care unit, which may be important when counseling patients and families.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We sought to determine which factors among patients who survived for at least 30 days post-ICU admission are associated with one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all ICU patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical center from 2001–2012 who survived ≥30 days from ICU admission.

Rationale &lt;p&gt;Factors associated with one-year mortality after recovery from critical illness are not well understood. Clinicians generally lack information regarding post-hospital discharge outcomes of patients from the intensive care unit, which may be important when counseling patients and families.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We sought to determine which factors among patients who survived for at least 30 days post-ICU admission are associated with one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Single-center, longitudinal retrospective cohort study of all ICU patients admitted to a tertiary-care academic medical center from 2001–2012 who survived ≥30 days from ICU admission. Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to identify the variables that are associated with one-year mortality. The primary outcome was one-year mortality.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;32,420 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study.

The cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) is implicated in neuroprotective signaling and neurotoxic pathways in both prion diseases and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (N-PrP) has been shown to interact with neurotoxic ligands, such as Aβ and Scrapie prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and to be crucial for the neuroprotective activity of PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;. To gain further insight into cellular pathways tied to PrP, we analyzed the brain interactome of N-PrP. As a novel approach employing recombinantly expressed PrP and intein-mediated protein ligation, we used N-PrP covalently coupled to beads as a bait for affinity purification. N-PrP beads were incubated with human AD or control brain lysates. N-PrP binding partners were then identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nano ESI-MS/MS). In addition to newly identified proteins we found many previously described PrP interactors, indicating a crucial role of the intrinsically disordered part of PrP in mediating protein interactions.

Overconfidence has been reported to be a common bias among entrepreneurs and might be one cause of the high failure rates observed for new ventures. In this study, we investigate the overconfidence bias in a sample of 92 Austrian entrepreneurs, who responded to a general-knowledge questionnaire. Their levels of overconfidence were assessed by their responses to hard, medium and easy knowledge questions, and the relations of individual, organizational and environmental factors to the bias score were analyzed. The results confirmed that entrepreneurs are indeed prone to expressing overprecision, a type of overconfidence, but not when answering questions of all levels of difficulty. Being a single founder instead of a co-founder was identified as a significant predictor of overconfidence. Confidence, on the other hand, was associated with age and prior entrepreneurial experience, while accuracy was determined solely by age. The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</content></content><author><name>Viktorija Ilieva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Viktorija Ilieva, Thomas Brudermann, Ljubomir Drakulevski&lt;/p&gt;

The results of this study only partly agree with those of previous studies conducted in different national and cultural settings.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197085</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525801148794</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16340d5e17a:47506b:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1526578752000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/693.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>94</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</link><title>Drilling threatens ancient Chaco landscape</title><fingerprint>8c368bbc</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1636f4dea2d:4a395e0:3dd877af</id><author><name>Reese, A.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/693?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Anthropology, Science and Policy</item></keywords><crawled>1526580767277</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37732</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527552000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37732</canonicalUrl><engagement>9</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37732</link><title>Coloring hidden viruses</title><fingerprint>f7624407</fingerprint><description>An improved dual-color reporter reveals how the fate of latent HIV-1 depends on where it integrates in the human genome.</description><visual><url>none</url></visual><author><name>marina.lusic@med.uni-heidelberg.de (Marina Lusic)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>An improved dual-color reporter reveals how the fate of latent HIV-1 depends on where it integrates in the human genome.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37732</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Microbiology and Infectious Disease</item></keywords><crawled>1527602159240</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163ac2f1e88:1f19cce:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725</originId><origin><title>The Journal of Physical Chemistry B: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jpcbfk</streamId></origin><published>1525752000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Accelerated Enveloping Distribution Sampling: Enabling Sampling of Multiple End States while Preserving Local Energy Minima</title><fingerprint>12ca7ec1</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jpcbfk/0/jpcbfk.ahead-of-print/acs.jpcb.8b02725/20180508/images/medium/jp-2018-02725y_0004.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The Journal of Physical Chemistry B&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b02725&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the cestode &lt;i&gt;Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, is a worldwide zoonotic infection. Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (&lt;i&gt;cox1&lt;/i&gt;) mitochondrial gene. &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;granulosus sensu stricto (s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;ortleppi&lt;/i&gt; (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples).

Many cellular processes depend on a precise structural organization of molecular components. Here, we established that neurons grown in culture provide a suitable system for in situ structural investigations of cellular structures by cryo-electron tomography, a method that allows high resolution, three-dimensional imaging of fully hydrated, vitrified cellular samples. A higher level of detail of cellular components present in our images allowed us to quantitatively characterize presynaptic and cytoskeletal organization, as well as structures involved in axonal transport and endocytosis. In this way we provide a structural framework into which information from other methods need to fit. Importantly, we show that short pleomorphic linkers (tethers and connectors) extensively interconnect different types of spherical vesicles and other lipid membranes in neurons imaged in a close-to-native state. These linkers likely serve to organize and precisely position vesicles involved in endocytosis, axonal transport and synaptic release.

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a popular method for measuring transcript abundance. The most commonly used method of interpretation is relative quantification and thus necessitates the use of normalization controls (i.e. reference genes) to standardize transcript abundance. The most popular gene targets for RT-qPCR are housekeeping genes because they are thought to maintain a static transcript level among a variety of samples. However, more recent studies have shown, several housekeeping genes are not reliably stable. This is the first study to examine the potential of several reference genes for use in RT-qPCR normalization during barley malting. The process of malting barley mechanizes the imbibition and subsequent germination of barley seeds under controlled conditions. Malt quality is controlled by many pleiotropic genes that are determined by examining the result of physiological changes the barley seed undergoes during the malting process. We compared the stability of 13 reference genes across both two-and six-row malting barleys (Conrad and Legacy, respectfully) throughout the entirety of the malting process. Initially, primer target specificity, amplification efficiency and average Ct values were determined for each of the selected primer pairs. Three statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to rank the stability of each reference gene. Rankings were similar between the two- and six-row with the exception of BestKeeper’s ranking of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt;). A consensus ranking among programs was determined using RefFinder. Our results show that Actin (A&lt;i&gt;CT&lt;/i&gt;) and Heat Shock Protein 70 (&lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) were the most stable throughout micromalting, while &lt;i&gt;GAPDH&lt;/i&gt; and Cyclophilin (&lt;i&gt;CYP&lt;/i&gt;) were the least stable. Two reference genes are necessary for stable transcript normalization according to geNorm and the best two reference genes (&lt;i&gt;ACT&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;HSP70&lt;/i&gt;) provided a sufficient level of stability.</content></content><author><name>Jason G.

Also, aesthetic analysis was performed in both groups to evaluate shape changes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;There was a 12.3% flap volume reduction after the completion of radiation in the experimental group that was significantly greater than the 2.6% volume reduction observed in the non-radiation group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01).

Addition of hydrogen radicals to these systems shows that the Be2B8Li14 electride becomes a Be2B8Li14H2 hydride electride whereas Be2B36Li21 leads to a Be2B36Li21H salt. Moreover, for the addition of Li atoms to Be2B8 and the Be2B36 backbones, large values of the interaction and of the adsorption energy per Li atom, high specific capacity of Be2B8Li14 and of Be2B36Li21 (1860 and 1017 mAh g−1, respectively) and low and flat voltage associated with lithiation have been found.

Modularity is a widespread property in biological systems. It implies that interactions occur mainly within groups of system elements. A modular arrangement facilitates adjustment of one module without perturbing the rest of the system. Therefore, modularity of developmental mechanisms is a major factor for evolvability, the potential to produce beneficial variation from random genetic change. Understanding how modularity evolves in gene regulatory networks, that create the distinct gene activity patterns that characterize different parts of an organism, is key to developmental and evolutionary biology. One hypothesis for the evolution of modules suggests that interactions between some sets of genes become maladaptive when selection favours additional gene activity patterns. The removal of such interactions by selection would result in the formation of modules. A second hypothesis suggests that modularity evolves in response to sparseness, the scarcity of interactions within a system. Here I simulate the evolution of gene regulatory networks and analyse diverse experimentally sustained networks to study the relationship between sparseness and modularity. My results suggest that sparseness alone is neither sufficient nor necessary to explain modularity in gene regulatory networks. However, sparseness amplifies the effects of forms of selection that, like selection for additional gene activity patterns, already produce an increase in modularity. That evolution of new gene activity patterns is frequent across evolution also supports that it is a major factor in the evolution of modularity. That sparseness is widespread across gene regulatory networks indicates that it may have facilitated the evolution of modules in a wide variety of cases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Eh0FCzbR2R4&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526676128418</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Carlos Espinosa-Soto&lt;/p&gt;

The study of plant remains in archaeological sites, along with a better understanding of the use of plants by prehistoric populations, can help us shed light on changes in survival strategies of hunter-gatherers and consequent impacts on modern human cognition, social organization, and technology. The archaeological locality of Pinnacle Point (Mossel Bay, South Africa) includes a series of coastal caves, rock-shelters, and open-air sites with human occupations spanning the Acheulian through Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Later Stone Age (LSA). These sites have provided some of the earliest evidence for complex human behaviour and technology during the MSA. We used phytoliths—amorphous silica particles that are deposited in cells of plants—as a proxy for the reconstruction of past human plant foraging strategies on the south coast of South Africa during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, emphasizing the use and control of fire as well as other possible plant uses. We analysed sediment samples from the different occupation periods at the rock shelter Pinnacle Point 5–6 North (PP5-6N). We also present an overview of the taphonomic processes affecting phytolith preservation in this site that will be critical to conduct a more reliable interpretation of the original plant use in the rock shelter. Our study reports the first evidence of the intentional gathering and introduction into living areas of plants from the Restionaceae family by MSA hunter-gatherers inhabiting the south coast of South Africa. We suggest that humans inhabiting Pinnacle Point during short-term occupation events during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 built fast fires using mainly grasses with some wood from trees and/or shrubs for specific purposes, perhaps for shellfish cooking. With the onset of MIS 4 we observed a change in the plant gathering strategies towards the intentional and intensive exploitation of dry wood to improve, we hypothesise, combustion for heating silcrete. This human behaviour is associated with changes in stone tool technology, site occupation intensity and climate change.</content></content><author><name>Irene Esteban</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Irene Esteban, Curtis W.

Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment promotes glioma progression. Chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans appear in the ECM and on the cell surface, and can be catalyzed by dermatan sulfate epimerase to form chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) hybrid chains. Dermatan sulfate epimerase 1 (DSE) is overexpressed in many types of cancer, and CS/DS chains mediate several growth factor signals. However, the role of DSE in gliomas has never been explored. In the present study, we determined the expression of DSE in gliomas by consulting a public database and conducting immunohistochemistry on a tissue array. Our investigation revealed that DSE was upregulated in gliomas compared with normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high DSE expression was associated with advanced tumor grade and poor survival. We found high DSE expression in several glioblastoma cell lines, and DSE expression directly mediated DS chain formation in glioblastoma cells. Knockdown of DSE suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioblastoma cells. In contrast, overexpression of DSE in GL261 cells enhanced these malignant phenotypes and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that DSE selectively regulated heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)-induced signaling in glioblastoma cells. Inhibiting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2 with afatinib suppressed DSE-enhanced malignant phenotypes, establishing the critical role of the ErbB pathway in regulating the effects of DSE expression. This evidence indicates that upregulation of DSE in gliomas contributes to malignant behavior in cancer cells.

The conformational conversion of pentameric C-reactive protein (pCRP) to monomeric CRP (mCRP) has been shown to play important roles in the action of CRP in inflammation regulation. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies revealed the origin of mCRP and provided insights into how pCRP dissociation affected its functions. However, the interplay and exact bioactivities of CRP isoforms still remain uncertain due to the rapid conformational conversion and complex milieu &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Herein, we have used surface-immobilization of pCRP to generate a preservable intermediate with dual antigenicity expression of both pCRP and mCRP. The intermediate has been further shown to exhibit modified bioactivities, such as a high affinity with solution-phase pCRP and an enhanced capacity of complement interaction.

These results thus not only provide the conformational conversion details of CRP, but also propose a simple way &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to study how the functions of CRP are tuned by distinct isoforms.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198375</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b952:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04519-8</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Chensu Wang</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04519-8</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04519-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Author Correction: Small-molecule TFEB pathway agonists that ameliorate metabolic syndrome in mice and extend C. elegans lifespan</title><fingerprint>14660fb</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Small-molecule TFEB pathway agonists that ameliorate metabolic syndrome in mice and extend &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;

We developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism’s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HxEjp5eCvBA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1525887730160</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gonçalo M.

Previous studies investigating to what extent students in elementary schools defend their victimized classmates typically treated defending as an individual characteristic. Defending should, however, be seen as a directed dyadic relationship between a victim and a defender, who are embedded multiple positive and negative relationships with each other and their classmates. Accordingly, in the present study defending was investigated using social network analysis. More specifically, it was investigated to what extent defending relationships co-occurred with friendship and dislike relationships involving not only the victim and the defender but also other classmates. Bivariate Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) were used to analyze the defending-friendship and defending-dislike relationships in seven grade-three classrooms. As hypothesized, the results indicated that victimized students were likely to be defended by students who they perceive as friends or who perceive them as friends. Moreover, defending was likely to occur when the victim and (potential) defender had the same friends. Victimized students were unlikely to be defended by classmates whom they disliked or who had indicated to dislike them. Finally, defending was likely to occur between students who disliked the same classmates.</content></content><author><name>Beau Oldenburg</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Beau Oldenburg, Marijtje Van Duijn, René Veenstra&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding what determines species’ geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure’) reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15%. We demonstrate that most species associations (95%) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes.

The purpose of this research is to explore the link between plasma amylase and insulin levels in growing pigs. Blood was obtained from piglets ranging in age from preterm (8 days to full gestation period), up to postnatal day 90 (2 months post-weaning) that underwent either duodenal-jejunal bariatric interposition surgery or a sham-operation. Plasma amylase activities in preterm and full-term neonates ranged between 500–600 U/L and were decreased by 50% two months post-weaning. Preprandial insulin and C-peptide levels in neonate piglets were not detectable, however they rose gradually after weaning. An increase in plasma amylase activity was observed in the young pigs that underwent duodenal-jejunum bypass (metabolic) surgery. The increase in blood pancreatic amylase activity after an intravenous amylase infusion lowered the subsequent glucose-stimulated insulin/C-peptide release. We suggest a role for blood amylase in the regulation of glucose homeostasis after observing high blood amylase levels in neonate pigs, in pigs that underwent metabolic surgery, and as a result of the reduced glucose-stimulated insulin response following intravenous amylase administration.

Visually evoked signals in the retina pass through the dorsal geniculate nucleus (dLGN) on the way to the visual cortex. This is however not a simple feedforward flow of information: there is a significant feedback from cortical cells back to both relay cells and interneurons in the dLGN. Despite four decades of experimental and theoretical studies, the functional role of this feedback is still debated. Here we use a firing-rate model, the extended difference-of-Gaussians (eDOG) model, to explore cortical feedback effects on visual responses of dLGN relay cells. For this model the responses are found by direct evaluation of two- or three-dimensional integrals allowing for fast and comprehensive studies of putative effects of different candidate organizations of the cortical feedback. Our analysis identifies a special mixed configuration of excitatory and inhibitory cortical feedback which seems to best account for available experimental data. This configuration consists of (i) a slow (long-delay) and spatially widespread inhibitory feedback, combined with (ii) a fast (short-delayed) and spatially narrow excitatory feedback, where (iii) the excitatory/inhibitory ON-ON connections are accompanied respectively by inhibitory/excitatory OFF-ON connections, i.e. following a phase-reversed arrangement. The recent development of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic methods has provided new tools for more precise manipulation and investigation of the thalamocortical circuit, in particular for mice. Such data will expectedly allow the eDOG model to be better constrained by data from specific animal model systems than has been possible until now for cat. We have therefore made the Python tool pyLGN which allows for easy adaptation of the eDOG model to new situations.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NEnghs1B4I8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milad Hobbi Mobarhan, Geir Halnes, Pablo Martínez-Cañada, Torkel Hafting, Marianne Fyhn, Gaute T.

Bell, Lynette V. Wynn, Ashura Bakari, Samuel A. Oppong, Jessica Youngblood, Zelda Arku, Yemah Bockarie, Joseph Adu, Priscilla Wobil, Gyikua Plange-Rhule, Bamenla Goka, Richard M. Adanu, Cheryl A. Moyer&lt;/p&gt;
Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</content></content><author><name>April J.

Neonatal mortality is a significant problem in many low-resource countries, yet for every death there are many more newborns who suffer a life-threatening complication but survive. These “near-misses” are not well defined, nor are they well understood. This study sought to explore how health care providers at three tertiary care centers in Ghana (each with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)) understand the term “near-miss.” Eighteen providers from the NICUs at three teaching hospitals in Ghana (Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, and Cape Coast Teaching Hospital in Cape Coast) were interviewed in depth regarding their perceptions of neonatal morbidity, mortality, and survival. Near the end of the interview, they were specifically asked what they understood the term “near-miss” to mean. Participants included nurses and physicians at various levels and with varying years of practice (mean years of practice = 9.33, mean years in NICU = 3.66). Results indicate that the concept of “near-misses” is not universally understood, and providers differ on whether a baby is a near-miss or not. Providers disagreed on the utility of a near-miss classification for clinical practice, with some suggesting it would be helpful to draw their attention to those at highest risk of dying, with others suggesting that the acuity of illness in a NICU means any baby could become a ‘near-miss’ at any moment. Further efforts are needed to standardize the definitions of neonatal near-misses, including developing criteria that are able to be assessed in a low-resource setting. In addition, further research is warranted to determine the practical implications of using a near miss tool in the process of providing care in a resource-limited setting and whether it might be best reserved as a retrospective indicator of overall quality of care provided.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198169</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb923:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6390/eaat1729?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Kim, K.

It is unclear how systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) controls local inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of human MSCs on inflammatory arthritis and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Mice with collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) received two intraperitoneal injections of human bone marrow-derived MSCs. The clinical and histological features of injected CAIA were then compared with those of non-injected mice. The effect of MSCs on induction of regulatory T cells was examined both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We also examined multiple cytokines secreted by peritoneal mononuclear cells, along with migration of MSCs in the presence of stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha (SDF-1α) and/or regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Sections of CAIA mouse joints and spleen were stained for human anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) to confirm migration of injected human MSCs. The results showed that MSCs alleviated the clinical and histological signs of synovitis in CAIA mice. Peritoneal lavage cells from mice treated with MSCs expressed higher levels of SDF-1α and RANTES than those from mice not treated with MSCs. MSC migration was more prevalent in the presence of SDF-1α and/or RANTES. MSCs induced CD4+ T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and expression of FOXP3 mRNA was upregulated in the forepaws of MSC-treated CAIA mice. Synovial and splenic tissues from CAIA mice receiving human MSCs were positive for human ANA, suggesting recruitment of MSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that MSCs migrate into inflamed tissues and directly induce the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory T cells, which then suppress inflammation. Thus, systemic administration of MSCs may be a therapeutic option for rheumatoid arthritis.</content></content><author><name>Yoojun Nam</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yoojun Nam, Seung Min Jung, Yeri Alice Rim, Hyerin Jung, Kijun Lee, Narae Park, Juryun Kim, Yeonsue Jang, Yong-Beom Park, Sung-Hwan Park, Ji Hyeon Ju&lt;/p&gt;

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) dedifferentiation from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype contributes to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic tissue has a chronic inflammatory component with high levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). VSMC of atheromatous plaques have increased autophagy, a mechanism responsible for protein and intracellular organelle degradation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether TNF-α induces phenotype switching of VSMCs and whether this effect depends on autophagy. Rat aortic Vascular smooth A7r5 cell line was used as a model to examine the phenotype switching and autophagy. These cells were stimulated with TNF-α 100 ng/mL. Autophagy was determined by measuring LC3-II and p62 protein levels. Autophagy was inhibited using chloroquine and siRNA Beclin1. Cell dedifferentiation was evaluated by measuring the expression of contractile proteins α-SMA and SM22, extracellular matrix protein osteopontin and type I collagen levels. Cell proliferation was measured by [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]-thymidine incorporation and MTT assay, and migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays. Expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 was assessed by ELISA. TNF-α induced autophagy as determined by increased LC3-II (1.91±0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased p62 (0.86±0.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05) when compared to control. Additionally, TNF-α decreased α-SMA (0.74±0.12, p&amp;lt;0.05) and SM22 (0.54±0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) protein levels. Consequently, TNF-α induced migration (1.25±0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), proliferation (2.33±0.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the secretion of IL-6 (258±53, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), type I collagen (3.09±0.85, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01) and osteopontin (2.32±0.46, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01). Inhibition of autophagy prevented all the TNF-α-induced phenotypic changes. TNF-α induces phenotype switching in A7r5 cell line by a mechanism that required autophagy. Therefore, autophagy may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</content></content><author><name>Marina García-Miguel</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Marina García-Miguel, Jaime A.

Introduction &lt;p&gt;Antenatal care (ANC) is a major public health intervention aimed at ensuring safe pregnancy outcomes. In Nigeria, the recommended minimum of four times ANC attendance is underutilized. This study investigates the prevalence and factors associated with underutilization of ANC services with a focus on the differences between rural and urban residences in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We analyzed the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey dataset with adjustment for the sampling weight and the cluster design of the survey. The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was assessed using frequency tabulation while associated factors were examined using Chi-Square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of underutilization of ANC was 46.5% in Nigeria, 61.1% in rural residence and 22.4% in urban residence. The North-West region had the highest prevalence of ANC underuse in Nigeria at 69.3%, 76.6% and 44.8% for the overall, rural and urban residences respectively. Factors associated with greater odds of ANC underuse in rural residence were maternal non-working status, birth interval &amp;lt; 24 months, single birth type, not listening to radio at all, lack of companionship to health facility and not getting money for health services. In urban residence, mothers professing Islam, those who did not read newspaper at all, and those who lacked health insurance, had greater odds of ANC underuse. In both rural and urban residence, maternal and husband’s education level, region of residence, wealth index, maternal age, frequency of watching television, distance to- and permission to visit health facility were significantly associated with ANC underuse.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Rural-urban differences exist in the use of ANC services, and to varying degrees, factors associated with underuse of ANC in Nigeria. Interventions aimed at addressing factors identified in this study may help to improve the utilization of ANC services both in rural and urban Nigeria. Such interventions need to focus more on reducing socioeconomic, geographic and regional disparities in access to ANC in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Emmanuel Olorunleke Adewuyi, Asa Auta, Vishnu Khanal, Olasunkanmi David Bamidele, Cynthia Pomaa Akuoko, Kazeem Adefemi, Samson Joseph Tapshak, Yun Zhao&lt;/p&gt;

Impairment in work function is a frequent outcome in patients with chronic conditions such as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), depression and anxiety disorders. The personal and economic costs of work impairment in these disorders are immense. Symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety are potentially remediable forms of distress that may contribute to work impairment in chronic health conditions such as IMID. The present study evaluated the association between pain [Medical Outcomes Study Pain Effects Scale], fatigue [Daily Fatigue Impact Scale], depression and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] and work impairment [Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Scale] in four patient populations: multiple sclerosis (n = 255), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 248, rheumatoid arthritis (n = 154) and a depression and anxiety group (n = 307), using quantile regression, controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors, physical disability, and cognitive deficits. Each of pain, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and fatigue individually showed significant associations with work absenteeism, presenteeism, and general activity impairment (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.3 to 1.0). When the distress variables were entered concurrently into the regression models, fatigue was a significant predictor of work and activity impairment in all models (quantile regression standardized estimates ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). These findings have important clinical implications for understanding the determinants of work impairment and for improving work-related outcomes in chronic disease.</content></content><author><name>Murray W.

Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Root Nodule Symbiosis are symbiotic interactions with a high benefit for plant growth and crop production. Thus, it is of great interest to understand the developmental process of these symbioses in detail. We analysed very early symbiotic responses of &lt;i&gt;Medicago truncatula&lt;/i&gt; root hair cells, by stimulation with lipochitinoligosaccharides specific for the induction of nodules (Nod-LCOs), or the interaction with mycorrhiza (Myc-LCOs). Intracellular micro electrodes were used, in combination with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensitive reporter dyes, to study the relations between cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and membrane potential changes. We found that sulfated Myc- as well as Nod-LCOs initiate a membrane depolarization, which depends on the chemical composition of these signaling molecules, as well as the genotype of the plants that were studied. A successive application of sulfated Myc-LCOs and Nod-LCOs resulted only in a single transient depolarization, indicating that Myc-LCOs can repress plasma membrane responses to Nod-LCOs. In contrast to current models, the Nod-LCO-induced depolarization precedes changes in the cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level of root hair cells. The Nod-LCO induced membrane depolarization thus is most likely independent of cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and nuclear Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spiking.</content></content><author><name>Anna-Lena Hürter</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Anna-Lena Hürter, Sébastien Fort, Sylvain Cottaz, Rainer Hedrich, Dietmar Geiger, M.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1) an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome measure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning suicides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Ian R.

Respective excesses were larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61, 2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy (OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation suicides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197805</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527010925494</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16388f19bb6:709406d:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/23/5962.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Zhenning Ren, Jumin Lee, Mahdi Muhammad Moosa, Yin Nian, Liya Hu, Zhichun Xu, Jason G.

Background &lt;p&gt;Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, second only to respiratory tract infections and particularly prevalent within primary care. Conventional detection of UTIs is culture, however, return of results can take between 24 and 72 hours. The introduction of a point of care (POC) test would allow for more timely identification of UTIs, facilitating improved, targeted treatment. This study aimed to obtain consensus on the criteria required for a POC UTI test, to meet patient need within primary care.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Criteria for consideration were compiled by the research team. These criteria were validated through a two-round Delphi process, utilising an expert panel of healthcare professionals from across Europe and United States of America. Using web-based questionnaires, panellists recorded their level of agreement with each criterion based on a 5-point Likert Scale, with space for comments. Using median response, interquartile range and comments provided, criteria were accepted/rejected/revised depending on pre-agreed cut-off scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The first round questionnaire presented thirty-three criteria to the panel, of which 22 were accepted. Consensus was not achieved for the remaining 11 criteria. Following response review, one criterion was removed, while after revision, the remaining 10 criteria entered the second round. Of these, four were subsequently accepted, resulting in 26 criteria considered appropriate for a POC test to detect urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;This study generated an approved set of criteria for a POC test to detect urinary infections.

The type C feruloyl esterase FoFaeC from &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt; is a newly discovered enzyme with high potential for use in the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass but it shows low activity towards sinapates. In this work, small molecule docking simulations were employed in order to identify important residues for the binding of the four model methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids, methyl ferulate/caffeate/sinapate/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumarate, to the predicted structure of FoFaeC. Subsequently rational redesign was applied to the enzyme’ active site in order to improve its specificity towards methyl sinapate. A double mutation (F230H/T202V) was considered to provide hydrophobic environment for stabilization of the methoxy substitution on sinapate and a larger binding pocket. Five mutant clones and the wild type were produced in &lt;i&gt;Pichia pastoris&lt;/i&gt; and biochemically characterized. All clones showed improved activity, substrate affinity, catalytic efficiency and turnover rate compared to the wild type against methyl sinapate, with clone P13 showing a 5-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency.

Caesarean section (CS) has short and long term adverse health consequences, and should therefore only be undertaken when necessary. Risk factors such as maternal age, maternal body mass index (BMI) and fetal weight have been extensively investigated in relation to CS, but the significance of maternal height has been less explored in Sweden. The aim was to investigate the significance of maternal height on risk of CS in a representative, population-based sample from Sweden, also taking into account confounders. Data on singleton births in the Swedish Pregnancy Register 2011 to 2016 were collected, including women with heights of 140 cm and above, constituting a sample of 581,844 women. Data were analysed with epidemiological and biostatistical methods. Mean height was 166.1 cm. Women born outside Sweden were significantly shorter than women born in Sweden (162.8 cm vs. 167.1 cm, p&amp;lt;0.001). There was a decreasing risk of CS with increasing maternal height. This effect remained after adjustment for other risk factors for CS such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age, parity, high birth weight and country of birth. Frequency of CS was higher among women born outside Sweden compared with Swedish-born women (17.3% vs. 16.0%), however, in a multiple regression model country of birth outside Sweden diminished as a risk factor for CS. Maternal height of 178–179 cm was associated with the lowest risk of CS (OR = 0.76, CI95% 0.71–0.81), whereas height below 160 cm explained 7% of CS cases. BMI and maternal age are established factors involved in clinical assessments related to birth, and maternal height should increasingly enjoy a similar status in these considerations. Moreover, when healthcare professionals are counselling pregnant women, taller stature should be more emphasized as a positive indicator for successful vaginal birth to increase pregnant women’s confidence in giving birth vaginally, with possible positive impacts for lowering CS rates.</content></content><author><name>Ingrid Mogren</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Ingrid Mogren, Maria Lindqvist, Kerstin Petersson, Carin Nilses, Rhonda Small, Gabriel Granåsen, Kristina Edvardsson&lt;/p&gt;

In the last decades, the use of zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) in biomedical research has increased. Anaesthesia is daily used in fish during experimental procedures to avoid discomfort, stress or pain. Also, fish welfare and the reliability of results can be compromised if an unsuitable anaesthetic protocol is used. Therefore, we aimed to refine anaesthetic protocols to be used in adult zebrafish by evaluating the efficacy of different anaesthetics, used alone or in combination. For that, zebrafish were randomly assigned to 8 different groups: 100 μg/mLMS-222 (MS); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate (E); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (E+L); 1.25 μg/mL propofol (P); 1.25 μg/mL propofol + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (P+L); 100 μg/mL ketamine (K); 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine (K+M); and 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine/3.125 μg/mL atipamezole (K+M/A). The animals were placed in an anaesthetic water bath, then, the following parameters were registered: time for equilibrium loss and anaesthesia induction, loss of sensitivity to soft and painful stimuli, respiratory rate, recovery time, and activity after recovery. The combined forms of E+L, P+L and K+M were the fastest to induce a surgical anaesthetic stage. Nevertheless, E+L induced respiratory depression, while K+M was shown to have the longer recovery time compared to MS-222, even when atipamezole was added. In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222.</content></content><author><name>Tânia Martins</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tânia Martins, Enoque Diniz, Luís M.

Our results demonstrate that properties of microtubules are highly dependent on the magnitude of the applied strain and offer a new interpretation for the large variety in microtubule mechanical data measured by different methods.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34695</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Cell Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1527854520792</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163bb39d9d8:3721fb0:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</originId><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><published>1527627600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527627600000</updated><engagement>68</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2003663</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>A novel unsupervised analysis of electrophysiological signals reveals new sleep substages in mice</title><fingerprint>284d5a5d</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;
Sleep science is entering a new era, thanks to new data-driven analysis approaches that, combined with mouse gene–editing technologies, show a promise in functional genomics and translational research. However, the investigation of sleep is time consuming and not suitable for large-scale phenotypic datasets, mainly due to the need for subjective manual annotations of electrophysiological states. Moreover, the heterogeneous nature of sleep, with all its physiological aspects, is not fully accounted for by the current system of sleep stage classification. In this study, we present a new data-driven analysis approach offering a plethora of novel features for the characterization of sleep. This novel approach allowed for identifying several substages of sleep that were hidden to standard analysis. For each of these substages, we report an independent set of homeostatic responses following sleep deprivation. By using our new substages classification, we have identified novel differences among various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, in a specific experiment with the &lt;i&gt;Zfhx3&lt;/i&gt; mouse line, a recent circadian mutant expressing both shortening of the circadian period and abnormal sleep architecture, we identified specific sleep states that account for genotypic differences at specific times of the day. These results add a further level of interaction between circadian clock and sleep homeostasis and indicate that dissecting sleep in multiple states is physiologically relevant and can lead to the discovery of new links between sleep phenotypes and genetic determinants. Therefore, our approach has the potential to significantly enhance the understanding of sleep physiology through the study of single mutations. Moreover, this study paves the way to systematic high-throughput analyses of sleep.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bBGe8ybdGnU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527623103626</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vasiliki-Maria Katsageorgiou, Diego Sona, Matteo Zanotto, Glenda Lassi, Celina Garcia-Garcia, Valter Tucci, Vittorio Murino&lt;/p&gt;

A new labeling reagent for vitamin analysis, 2-amino-10-ethyl acridine ketone (AEAO), has been synthesized and successfully applied to the analysis of vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 in different tea samples. The reaction of AEAO with vitamins could proceed easily and quickly in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) as condensing reagent within 45 min. The derivatives exhibited excellent fluorescence property with excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 430 nm, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to the optimization of pre-column derivatization. Solid phase extraction with HLB cartridges was used for the extraction and purification of water-soluble vitamins in tea samples. The LODs for vitamin B3 and vitamin B7 were 2.56 and 2.22 ng mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug interactions is often limited because these complex relationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an important challenge with significant implications for patient mortality and morbidity. Here, we present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions, drug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different type.

Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it automatically learns representations of side effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because of effective sharing of model parameters across edge types.

However, the molecular mechanisms of chromosome translocations remain largely unknown. The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein, a DNA damage signaling regulator, facilitates DNA repair to prevent chromosome abnormalities. Previously, we showed that ATM deficiency led to the 11q23 chromosome translocation, the most frequent chromosome abnormalities in secondary leukemia. Here, we show that ARP8, a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, is phosphorylated after etoposide treatment. The etoposide-induced phosphorylation of ARP8 is regulated by ATM and ATR, and attenuates its interaction with INO80. The ATM-regulated phosphorylation of ARP8 reduces the excessive loading of INO80 and RAD51 onto the breakpoint cluster region. These findings suggest that the phosphorylation of ARP8, regulated by ATM, plays an important role in maintaining the fidelity of DNA repair to prevent the etoposide-induced 11q23 abnormalities.</description><author><name>ktashiro@hiroshima-u.ac.jp (Aiko Kinomura)</name></author><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Chromosomal translocations are hallmarks of various types of cancers and leukemias.

Recently, they have also been used to address the accuracy of force fields for various organic compounds and specifically the methylated DNA bases. In this study, atomic charges were derived by different partitioning methods (Hirshfeld and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder) directly from the electron density obtained by electronic structure calculations in a vacuum, with an implicit solvation model or with explicit solvation taking the dynamics of the solute and the solvent into account. To test the ability of these charges to describe electrostatic interactions in force fields for condensed phases, the original atomic charges of the AMBER99 force field were replaced with the new atomic charges and combined with different solvent models to obtain the hydration and chloroform solvation free energies by molecular dynamics simulations. Chloroform–water partition coefficients derived from the obtained free energies were compared to experimental and previously reported values obtained with the GAFF or the AMBER‐99 force field. The results show that good agreement with experimental data is obtained when the polarization of the electron density by the solvent has been taken into account, and when the energy needed to polarize the electron density of the solute has been considered in the transfer free energy. These results were further confirmed by hydration free energies of polar and aromatic amino acid side chain analogs. Comparison of the two partitioning methods, Hirshfeld‐I and Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS), revealed some deficiencies in the Hirshfeld‐I method related to the unstable isolated anionic nitrogen pro‐atom used in the method.

Particle separation in microfluidic devices is a common problematic for sample preparation in biology. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is efficiently implemented as a size-based fractionation technique to separate two populations of particles around a specific size. However, real biological samples contain components of many different sizes and a single DLD separation step is not sufficient to purify these complex samples. When connecting several DLD modules in series, pressure balancing at the DLD outlets of each step becomes critical to ensure an optimal separation efficiency. A generic microfluidic platform is presented in this paper to optimize pressure balancing, when DLD separation is connected either to another DLD module or to a different microfluidic function. This is made possible by generating droplets at T-junctions connected to the DLD outlets. Droplets act as pressure controllers, which perform at the same time the encapsulation of DLD sorted particles and the balance of output pressures. The optimized pressures to apply on DLD modules and on T-junctions are determined by a general model that ensures the equilibrium of the entire platform. The proposed separation platform is completely modular and reconfigurable since the same predictive model applies to any cascaded DLD modules of the droplet-based cartridge.</content></content><author><name>Eloise Pariset</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eloise Pariset, Catherine Pudda, François Boizot, Nicolas Verplanck, Frédéric Revol-Cavalier, Jean Berthier, Aurélie Thuaire, Vincent Agache&lt;/p&gt;

Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher &lt;i&gt;HF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;nu&lt;/sub&gt; values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (&lt;i&gt;AUC&lt;/i&gt; = 0.92 ± 0.01; &lt;i&gt;Se&lt;/i&gt; = 0.91 ± 0.06; &lt;i&gt;Sp&lt;/i&gt; = 0.90 ± 0.05).

The present work set out to search for a virulence repertoire distinctive for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; causing primitive acute pyelonephritis (APN). To this end, the virulence potential of 18 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; APN strains was genotypically and phenotypically assessed, comparatively with 19 strains causing recurrent cystitis (RC), and 16 clinically not significant (control, CO) strains. Most of the strains belong to phylogenetic group B1 (69.8%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.01), and APN strains showed unique features, which are the presence of phylogroup A, and the absence of phylogroup B2 and non-typeable strains. Overall, the most dominant virulence factor genes (VFGs) were &lt;i&gt;ecpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt; (92.4 and 86.7%, respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), and the mean number of VFGs was significantly higher in uropathogenic strains. Particularly, &lt;i&gt;papAH&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; were exclusive for uropathogenic strains. APN and RC strains showed a significantly higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;fyuA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;malX&lt;/i&gt; than of CO strains. Compared to RC strains, APN ones showed a higher prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iha&lt;/i&gt;, but a lower prevalence of &lt;i&gt;iroN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cnf1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;kpsMT-II&lt;/i&gt;.

The motility level did not differ among the study-groups and phylogroups considered, although a higher proportion of swarming strains was observed in APN strains. Antibiotic-resistance rates were generally low except for ampicillin (37.7%), and were not associated with specific study- or phylogenetic groups. APN and RC strains produced more biofilm than CO strains.

Sequence comparison indicate high similarity to fungal cellulose binding domains, raising the question of why these domains exist in coccolithophores.

Background &lt;p&gt;Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a high throughput technique that measures absorbance of specific wavelengths of light by biological samples and uses this information to classify the age of lab-reared mosquitoes as younger or older than seven days with an average accuracy greater than 80%. For NIRS to estimate ages of wild mosquitoes, a sample of wild mosquitoes with known age in days would be required to train and test the model. Mark-release-recapture is the most reliable method to produce wild-caught mosquitoes of known age in days. However, it is logistically demanding, time inefficient, subject to low recapture rates, and raises ethical issues due to the release of mosquitoes. Using labels from Detinova dissection results in a mathematical model with poor accuracy. Alternatively, a model trained on spectra from laboratory-reared mosquitoes where age in days is known can be applied to estimate the age of wild mosquitoes, but this would be appropriate only if spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes are similar.&lt;/p&gt; Methods and findings &lt;p&gt;We performed &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 2) cluster analysis on a mixture of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild &lt;i&gt;Anopheles arabiensis&lt;/i&gt; to determine if there is any significant difference between these two groups. While controlling the numbers of mosquitoes included in the model at each age, we found two clusters with no significant difference in distribution of spectra collected from lab-reared and wild mosquitoes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.25). We repeated the analysis using hierarchical clustering, and similarly, no significant difference was observed (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.13).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;We find no difference between spectra collected from laboratory-reared and wild mosquitoes of the same age and species. The results strengthen and support the on-going practice of applying the model trained on spectra collected from laboratory-reared mosquitoes, especially first-generation laboratory-reared mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Masabho P.

This paper is concerned with the potential multistability of protein concentrations in the cell. That is, situations where one, or a family of, proteins may sit at one of two or more different steady state concentrations in otherwise identical cells, and in spite of them being in the same environment. For models of multisite protein phosphorylation for example, in the presence of excess substrate, it has been shown that the achievable number of stable steady states can increase linearly with the number of phosphosites available. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of adding enzyme docking to these and similar models, with the resultant sequestration of phosphatase and kinase by the fully unphosphorylated and by the fully phosphorylated substrates respectively. In the large molecule numbers limit, where deterministic analysis is applicable, we prove that there are always values for these rates of sequestration which, when exceeded, limit the extent of multistability. For the models considered here, these numbers are much smaller than the affinity of the enzymes to the substrate when it is in a modifiable state. As substrate enzyme-sequestration is increased, we further prove that the number of steady states will inevitably be reduced to one. For smaller molecule numbers a stochastic analysis is more appropriate, where multistability in the large molecule numbers limit can manifest itself as multimodality of the probability distribution; the system spending periods of time in the vicinity of one mode before jumping to another. Here, we find that substrate enzyme sequestration can induce bimodality even in systems where only a single steady state can exist at large numbers. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a weakly chained diagonally dominant M-matrix formulation of the Chemical Master Equation, allowing greater insights in the way particular mechanisms, like enzyme sequestration, can shape probability distributions and therefore exhibit different behaviour across different regimes.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2a3YD9EnPsk&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526589728774</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Andreas Petrides, Glenn Vinnicombe&lt;/p&gt;

And that’s the currency of the realm: do you want to build up larger molecules from smaller precursors in a controlled fashion? You’re going to have to make bonds when and where you want them to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those organometallic reagents are tricky beasts, whether catalytic or stoichiometric. Just understanding what the actual structures of some of them are has occupied people for years on end, because a given system can adopt a whole range of structures – and thus form completely different reagents – depending on solvent, temperature, counterions, concentration, added salts, stoichiometry, order of addition, and so on. To make matters more interesting, some of the actual reactive species are formed only in small, transient amounts, which makes proving their existence even more fraught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/anie.201802087&quot;&gt;a recent example&lt;/a&gt;. One of the many things you can do with Grignard reagents, a classic organometallic species if ever there was, is to couple them onto vinyl bromides and haloalkenes in general, with iron catalysis. It turns out, though, that the yields for this are far better when the reaction is run in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) than in any other solvent (an effect discovered in 1998, over twenty years since the reaction was first reported). That one’s not exactly the first choice for this sort of thing, so it’s interesting to know that it works so well. But why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sizes=&quot;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&quot; src=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-300x180.jpeg 300w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP-768x460.jpeg 768w, http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/NMP.jpeg 996w&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-13567&quot; height=&quot;180&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had already been figured out that if you take methylmagnesium bromide and an iron(III) salt in THF, that a new species forms: magnesium(penta-THF) chloride cation and a penta-iron-octa-methyl cluster anion. That was thought to be the active methyl-coupling reagent, but the yields are never that great in THF (which is probably what led to the solvent screening work that uncovered the NMP effect). Now we finally know what that works. In that new solvent, a completely different complex salt forms: magnesium hexa-NMP cation (+2 charge), with two trimethyliron anions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those irons are exceptionally reactive; you really don’t see alkyliron species without other stabilizing ligands on them very often, but for some reason you get them here. NMP is a pretty highly coordinating solvent, so in the absence of experimental evidence you’d figure that the solvent is in there on both the iron and magnesium centers. But it turns out that it’s just the latter (as suggested by magnetic circular dichroism spectra in solution, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectroscopy&quot;&gt;Mössbauer spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; along with X-ray diffraction on isolated crystals of the complex. Mössbauer is not the first technique you reach for (since you need an appropriate gamma-ray source) but it’s extremely sensitive to several different kinds of changes that affect the energy levels of sensitive nuclei, which are mostly metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we know, and another piece of knowledge gets added to the organometallic pile, and another idea for future reagents and reactions gets queued up. Eventually we’ll understand this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1527602714000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Synthetic organic chemists spend a lot of time using organometallic coupling reactions, because they can be such great ways to make carbon-carbon (and carbon-heteroatom) bonds.

Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. These tumors can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast the manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZu0gxkmVxM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528317724227</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seth Haney, Jessica Konen, Adam I.

The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) and control (0.30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). The final average VWC was 0.11, 0.22, and 0.31 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, and significant differences in biomass accumulation were observed between control and drought treatments. Second, 42 diverse sorghum genotypes were subjected to a seven-day dry-down treatment for a final drought stress of 0.15 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; VWC. The final average VWC was 0.17 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;, and plants presented significant differences in photosynthetic rate during the drought period. These results demonstrate that cost-effective automation systems can successfully control substrate water content for each plant, to accurately compare their phenotypic responses to drought, and be scaled up for high-throughput phenotyping studies.</content></content><author><name>Diego Ortiz</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Ortiz, Alexander G.

Access to surgical care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains deficient without an adequate workforce. There is limited understanding of the gender gap in surgical trainees in LMICs. In Rwanda, females fill only one of 20 positions available. Understanding surgeons’ experiences and perceptions of surgical careers may help facilitate support for females to contribute to the global surgical workforce. We performed qualitative analysis on perceptions of surgical careers through semi-structured interviews of all female surgeons (n = 6) and corresponding male surgeons (n = 6) who are training or have trained at University of Rwanda. Transcripts were analyzed with code structure formed through an integrated approach. Question categories formed the deductive framework, while theoretical saturation was reached through inductive grounded theory. Themes were organized within two key points of the career timeline. First, for developing interest in surgery, three main themes were identified: role models, patient case encounters, and exposure to surgery. Second, for selecting and sustaining surgical careers, four main themes emerged: social expectations about roles within the family, physical and mental challenges, professional and personal support, and finances. All female surgeons emphasized gender assumptions and surgical working culture as obstacles, with a corresponding strong sense of self-confidence and internal motivation that drew them to select and maintain careers in surgery. Family, time, and physical endurance were cited as persistent challenges for female participants. Our study reveals concepts for further exploration about gendered perceptions of surgical careers. Efforts to improve support for female surgical careers as a strategy for shaping surgical work culture and professional development in Rwanda should be considered. Such strategies may be beneficial for improving the global surgical workforce.</content></content><author><name>Sojung Yi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sojung Yi, Yihan Lin, Grace Kansayisa, Ainhoa Costas-Chavarri&lt;/p&gt;

The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have been used as lipid lowering drugs for decades and several epidemiological studies suggest statin usage correlates with a decreased incidence of cancer specific mortality in patients. However, the mechanism of this mortality benefit remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that statin drug lipophilicity and affinity for its target enzyme, HMGCR, determine their growth suppressive potency against various tumor cell lines. The lipophilic atorvastatin decreases cancer cell proliferation and survival &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Statin sensitivity coincided with Ras localization to the cytosol instead of the membrane, consistent with a decrement in prenylation. To investigate signaling pathways that may be involved with sensitivity to statin therapy, we employed inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and Mek-Erk signaling cascades. We found that inhibition of PI3K signaling through Akt potentiated statin sensitivity of breast cancer cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in co-culture with primary human hepatocytes. The same effect was not observed with inhibition of Mek signaling through Erk. Moreover, the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to atorvastatin-mediated growth suppression correlated with a decrease in EGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt. As an increase in Akt activity has been shown to be involved in the metastasis and metastatic outgrowth of many cancer types (including breast), these data suggest a mechanism by which statins may reduce cancer specific mortality in patients.</content></content><author><name>Colin H.

This in turn predicts that GR and other transcriptional activators function via multiple distinct chromatin-based mechanisms to modulate the transcriptional response.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35073</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Chromosomes and Gene Expression</item></keywords><crawled>1527170660593</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_1639276f8f1:7c20c11:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25618-y</originId><origin><title>Scientific Reports - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/srep/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Estefânia V.

The development of farming was a catalyst for the evolution of the human diet from the varied subsistence practices of hunter-gatherers to the more globalised food economy we depend upon today. Although there has been considerable research into the dietary changes associated with the initial spread of farming, less attention has been given to how dietary choices continued to develop during subsequent millennia. A paleogenomic time transect for 5 millennia of human occupation in the Great Hungarian Plain spanning from the advent of the Neolithic to the Iron Age, showed major genomic turnovers. Here we assess where these genetic turnovers are associated with corresponding dietary shifts, by examining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of 52 individuals. Results provide evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers. Other Neolithic individuals and those from the Copper Age to Bronze Age periods relied mostly on terrestrial C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plant resources.

Background &lt;p&gt;While dyslipidemia importantly contributes to increased cardiovascular disease risk among patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), data on lipid patterns among African adults on ART are limited. We describe the prevalence of lipid abnormalities and associated factors in two HIV clinics in Malawi.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2014 and enrolled adult patients at a rural and an urban HIV clinic in Zomba district, Malawi. We recorded patient characteristics, CVD risk factors and anthropometric measurements, using the WHO STEPS validated instrument. Non-fasting samples were taken for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with elevated TC and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;554 patients were enrolled, 50% at the rural HIV clinic, 72.7% were female, the median (IQR) age was 42 years (36–50); 97.3% were on ART, 84.4% on tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz, 17.5% were overweight/obese and 27.8%% had elevated waist/hip ratio. 15.5% had elevated TC, 15.9% reduced HDL-c, 28.7% had elevated TG and 3.8% had elevated TC/HDL-c ratio. Lipid abnormalities were similar in rural and urban patients. Women had significantly higher burden of elevated TC and TG whereas men had higher prevalence of reduced HDL-c. Waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with elevated TC (aOR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17–3.10, p = 0.01) and elevated TC/HDL-c ratio (aOR = 3.50; 95% CI: 1.38–8.85, p = 0.008). Increasing age was independently associated with elevated TC level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI 0.51–4.59 for age 31–45; aOR = 3.69, 95% CI 1.24–10.95 for age &gt;45 years vs. ≤30 years; p-trend &amp;lt;0.01).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;We found a moderate burden of dyslipidemia among Malawian adults on ART, which was similar in rural and urban patients but differed significantly between men and women.

Prevalence and molecular epidemiology studies for hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus are scarce in Warao Amerindians from Venezuela, where an epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has recently been documented. To carry out a molecular epidemiology analysis of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus in Warao individuals from the Delta Amacuro State of Venezuela. A total of 548 sera were tested for serological and molecular markers for HBV and HCV. The prevalence of active infection (presence of HBV surface antigen, HBsAg), exposure to HBV (presence of Antibody to HBV core antigen, anti-HBc) and anti-HCV, was 1.8%, 13% and 0% respectively. HBV exposure was significantly lower in men below 18 years old and also lower than rates previously reported in other Amerindian communities from Venezuela. Thirty one percent (31%, 25/80) of individuals without evidence of HBV infection exhibited anti-HBs titer ≥ 10U.I / ml, being significantly more frequent in individuals younger than 20 years. A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</content></content><author><name>Ruth Y.

A higher HBV exposure was observed among HIV-1 positive individuals (33% vs 11%, p &amp;lt;0.005). A high prevalence of occult HBV infection was also observed (5.6%, 11/195). Phylogenetic analysis of S gene and complete HBV genomes showed that F3 is the only circulating subgenotype, different from the F2 subgenotype found in 1991 in this population. These results suggest a recent introduction of subgenotype F3, with a low divergence among the isolates. These results highlight the importance of molecular epidemiology studies for viral control, and support the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing transmission of HBV.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197662</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd71:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005754</originId><origin><title>PLOS Biology: New Articles</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-rss&amp;issn=1545-7885&amp;type=new-articles</streamId></origin><published>1527282000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527282000000</updated><engagement>1</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pbio.2005754</link><canonical><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005754</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>A G-protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor recognizes lipopolysaccharide for bacterial phagocytosis</title><fingerprint>df3fd1f1</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Miao Pan, Matthew P.

Phagocytes locate microorganisms via chemotaxis and then consume them using phagocytosis. &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; amoebas are stereotypical phagocytes that prey on diverse bacteria using both processes. However, as typical phagocytic receptors, such as complement receptors or Fcγ receptors, have not been found in &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt;, it remains mysterious how these cells recognize bacteria. Here, we show that a single G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), folic acid receptor 1 (fAR1), simultaneously recognizes the chemoattractant folate and the phagocytic cue lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of bacterial surfaces. Cells lacking fAR1 or its cognate G-proteins are defective in chemotaxis toward folate and phagocytosis of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella aerogenes&lt;/i&gt;. Computational simulations combined with experiments show that responses associated with chemotaxis can also promote engulfment of particles coated with chemoattractants. Finally, the extracellular Venus-Flytrap (VFT) domain of fAR1 acts as the binding site for both folate and LPS. Thus, fAR1 represents a new member of the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and mediates signaling from both bacterial surfaces and diffusible chemoattractants to reorganize actin for chemotaxis and phagocytosis.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PEhoJrnI4ew&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1527271392826</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Miao Pan, Matthew P.

Endothelial cells play an essential role in regulating an immune response through promoting leukocyte adhesion and cell migration and production of cytokines such as TNFα. Regulation of endothelial cell immune function is tightly regulated and recent studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are prominently involved in this process. However, the importance of EVs in regulating endothelial activation in the context of a bacterial infection is poorly understood. To begin addressing this knowledge gap we characterized the endothelial cell response to EVs released from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infected macrophages. Our result showed increased macrophage migration through the monolayer when endothelial cells were pretreated with EVs isolated from &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and the inflammatory process in endothelial cells treated with EVs. These results were validated by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several immune response-related pathways were up-regulated. Endothelial cells were also treated with EVs isolated from the serum of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, EVs isolated 14 days but not 7 or 21 days post-infection showed a similar ability to induce endothelial cell activation suggesting a change in EV function during the course of an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy result indicated that NF-κB and the Type 1 interferon pathways were involved in endothelial activation by EVs. In summary, our data suggest that EVs can activate endothelial cells and thus may play an important role in modulating host immune responses during an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection.</content></content><author><name>Li Li</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Li Li, Yong Cheng, Scott Emrich, Jeffrey Schorey&lt;/p&gt;

To begin addressing this knowledge gap we characterized the endothelial cell response to EVs released from &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infected macrophages. Our result showed increased macrophage migration through the monolayer when endothelial cells were pretreated with EVs isolated from &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected macrophages. Transcriptome analysis showed a significant upregulation of genes involved in cell adhesion and the inflammatory process in endothelial cells treated with EVs. These results were validated by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry. Pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes indicated that several immune response-related pathways were up-regulated. Endothelial cells were also treated with EVs isolated from the serum of &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice. Interestingly, EVs isolated 14 days but not 7 or 21 days post-infection showed a similar ability to induce endothelial cell activation suggesting a change in EV function during the course of an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection. Immunofluorescence microscopy result indicated that NF-κB and the Type 1 interferon pathways were involved in endothelial activation by EVs. In summary, our data suggest that EVs can activate endothelial cells and thus may play an important role in modulating host immune responses during an &lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt; infection.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198337</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b950:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024678?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Yan Zhao</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024678?af=R</link><title>Measuring order in disordered systems and disorder in ordered systems: Random matrix theory for isotropic and nematic liquid crystals and its perspective on pseudo-nematic domains</title><fingerprint>a56b8c9c</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/20&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 20&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1526960515000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 20, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5024678?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527492817805</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_163a5aab38d:1587646:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198379</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527195600000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527195600000</updated><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198379</canonicalUrl><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198379</link><title>Correction: Family history and obesity in youth, their effect on acylcarnitine/aminoacids metabolomics and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Background &lt;p&gt;Despite the considerable burden of helminth infections in developing countries and increasing international travel, little is known about the risks of infection for travelers.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;We studied the attack and incidence rate of serology confirmed strongyloidiasis, filariasis, and toxocariasis among long-term travelers and associated factors. A second objective was to evaluate eosinophilia as a positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) for a recent helminth infection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From 2008 to 2011, clients of the Public Health Service travel clinic planning travel to (sub)tropical countries for 12–52 weeks were invited to participate in a prospective study. Participants kept a weekly diary, recording itinerary, symptoms, and physician visits during travel and completed a post-travel questionnaire. Pre- and post-travel blood samples were serologically tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; species, &lt;i&gt;Strongyloides stercoralis&lt;/i&gt;, filarial species, and &lt;i&gt;Toxacara&lt;/i&gt; species and were used for a blood cell count. Factors associated with recent infection were analyzed using Poisson regression. Differences among groups of travelers were studied using chi square tests.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For the 604 participants, median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23–29), 36% were male, median travel duration was 20 weeks (IQR: 15–25), and travel purpose was predominantly tourism (62%). Destinations were Asia (45%), Africa (18%), and the Americas (37%).Evidence of previous infection was found in 13/604 participants: antibodies against &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 5 (0.8%), against &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;stercoralis&lt;/i&gt; in 3 (0.5%), against filarial species in 4 (0.7%), and against &lt;i&gt;Toxocara&lt;/i&gt; spp. in 1 (0.2%). Ten recent infections were found in 9 participants (3, 1, 6, 0 cases, in the above order), making the attack rates 0.61, 0.17, 1.1 and 0, and the incidence rates per 1000 person-months 1.5, 0.34, 2.6 and 0. The overall PPV and NPV of eosinophila for recent infection were 0 and 98%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The risk of the helminth infections under study in this cohort of long-term travelers was low.

Infrared (IR) spectroscopy has been used in many pharmaceutical and forensic applications but has yet to be applied to adherence monitoring.

Spectral data obtained from swabs placed directly on the spectrometer were divided into calibration and testing sets for developing and validating discriminant models set up to provide yes/no predictions of: vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen. Further validation of models was performed using vaginal swabs collected from a clinical study evaluating vaginally administered placebo insert formulations.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;For each discriminant model developed to predict vaginal vs. non-vaginal use, presence vs. no presence of each test product, and presence vs. no presence of semen, classified validation samples not included in the model development were correctly identified into their respective classes with minimal prediction error.

When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However, likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever increasing throughput of DNA sequencing. Results: We have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.

This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However, likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever increasing throughput of DNA sequencing. Results: We have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.

Dairy farming is one the most important sectors of United Kingdom (UK) agriculture. It faces major challenges due to climate change, which will have direct impacts on dairy cows as a result of heat stress. In the absence of adaptations, this could potentially lead to considerable milk loss. Using an 11-member climate projection ensemble, as well as an ensemble of 18 milk loss estimation methods, temporal changes in milk production of UK dairy cows were estimated for the 21st century at a 25 km resolution in a spatially-explicit way. While increases in UK temperatures are projected to lead to relatively low average annual milk losses, even for southern UK regions (&amp;lt;180 kg/cow), the ‘hottest’ 25×25 km grid cell in the hottest year in the 2090s, showed an annual milk loss exceeding 1300 kg/cow. This figure represents approximately 17% of the potential milk production of today’s average cow. Despite the potential considerable inter-annual variability of annual milk loss, as well as the large differences between the climate projections, the variety of calculation methods is likely to introduce even greater uncertainty into milk loss estimations. To address this issue, a novel, more biologically-appropriate mechanism of estimating milk loss is proposed that provides more realistic future projections. We conclude that South West England is the region most vulnerable to climate change economically, because it is characterised by a high dairy herd density and therefore potentially high heat stress-related milk loss. In the absence of mitigation measures, estimated heat stress-related annual income loss for this region by the end of this century may reach £13.4M in average years and £33.8M in extreme years.</content></content><author><name>Nándor Fodor</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nándor Fodor, Andreas Foskolos, Cairistiona F.

Background &lt;p&gt;Odd-numbered chain saturated fatty acids (OCSFA) have been associated with potential health benefits. Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.&lt;/p&gt; Objective &lt;p&gt;To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.&lt;/p&gt; Design &lt;p&gt;We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (&lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt;) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We found no genome-wide significant evidence that common genetic variation is associated with circulating levels of C15:0 or C23:0. In two cohorts with available data, we identified one intronic SNP (rs13361131) in myosin X gene (&lt;i&gt;MYO10)&lt;/i&gt; associated with C17:0 level (P = 1.37×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;), and two intronic SNP (rs12874278 and rs17363566) in deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (&lt;i&gt;DLEU1)&lt;/i&gt; region associated with C19:0 level (P = 7.07×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, when using a candidate-gene approach, we found evidence that three SNPs in &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; (rs11884924, rs16832067, and rs3816088) are associated with circulating C17:0 level (adjusted P = 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, nine SNPs in the ceramide synthase 4 (&lt;i&gt;CERS4)&lt;/i&gt; region were associated with circulating C23:0 levels (adjusted P&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that circulating levels of OCSFA may be predominantly influenced by non-genetic factors. SNPs associated with C17:0 level in the &lt;i&gt;LCT&lt;/i&gt; gene may reflect genetic influence in dairy consumption or in metabolism of dairy foods.

This was the antibody-drug conjugate that they’d purchased from Stemcentryx – OK, let’s clarify that, they bought Stemcentryx out completely for nearly six billion dollars, largely to get their hands on this great new drug. As that March post says, though, the clinical results were deeply unimpressive. AbbVie stock took quite a hit on the news, even though there were already grounds for suspicion about just how the trial (TRINITY) would come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the company has done a more thorough presentation of the data at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, and if anything, it’s even worse than it appeared in March. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zbiotech/status/1003966802370682885&quot;&gt;@zbiotech on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is quoting a Leerink analysis (by Geoffrey Porges, I assume, who has been following this drug’s progress closely), and it’s not the tiniest bit encouraging. “&lt;em&gt;The results shown in the presentation were even worse than we had feared. . .we can’t help but regard the ongoing trials as largely fruitless exercises&lt;/em&gt;“. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem for AbbVie is that it’s the adverse events that are sinking Rova-T, and those may be built into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://investors.abbvie.com/news-releases/news-release-details/abbvie-expand-oncology-presence-through-acquisition-stemcentrx&quot;&gt;other programs&lt;/a&gt; that they bought from Stemcentryx, since these apparently use the same cytotoxic payload. At the very least, it casts a real shadow over things. Going back and reading that last link, the 2016 press release announcing the deal, is a grim experience. It’s all about how this is a multibillion dollar opportunity, expected commercialization in 2018, compelling data in the earlier trials, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s go back to that Leerink analysis: “&lt;em&gt;The TRINITY study provided yet another lesson in the perils of relying on single arm early trials without doing a randomized trial. . .&lt;/em&gt;” It certainly does that. Not everyone would have reached into their pocket for $5.8 billion on seeing the earlier Stemcentryx data (that figure on AbbVie), but you could have gotten a lot of people to agree that it looked promising. But “promising” or even “compelling” clinical data are only as solid as the clinical trials that generate them, and single-arm trials are just not solid enough to put that kind of money down on them with any real confidence. Sure, you’re going to win sometimes – but don’t pretend that you’re not gambling. And don’t get the idea that I’m speaking out against taking those kinds of risks in this business (sometimes you have to), but it would help to be a bit more honest about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth thinking about this situation in light of that &amp;lt;sarcasm&gt; amazing, life-saving Right to Try bill &amp;lt;/sarcasm&gt; that was just signed. This is exactly the sort of drug that comes under its purview. Early, early stage results, promising for a deadly disease. Give it to the poor desperate patients! But that’s no kindness: Rova-T turns out to be &lt;em&gt;worse than the standard of care&lt;/em&gt;. You are not only not helping lung cancer patients with it, you are objectively doing them harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what happens with the involvement of a huge, perfectly competent drug company that is willing to spend billions of dollars up front. What happens with smaller, shakier even-less-statistically powered approaches to deadly disease? Well, what do you think? And that doesn’t even take us to the bigger fear I have about the whole approach, that even worse outfits will configure themselves just to make money off the desperately ill, in completely legal fashion, without even bothering themselves about whether the &lt;del&gt;marks&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;customers&lt;/del&gt; patients have any chance of being helped or not. We’re not there yet, but we’ve opened the door to it. Haven’t we, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/06/01/the-fdas-latest-actions-and-problems&quot;&gt;Senator Johnson&lt;/a&gt;? There’s a man who apparently has no opinion whatsoever about the ability of the President to pardon himself – Hands in the air! Huge shrug! Who knows! – but he is &lt;em&gt;confident&lt;/em&gt; that the FDA needs to get out of the way so that people can take drugs like Rova-T.

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013).

Purpose &lt;p&gt;Active recovery is often used by athletes after strenuous exercise or competition but its underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that active recovery speeds-up recovery processes within the muscle and the central nervous system (CNS).&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We assessed muscular and CNS recovery by measuring the voluntary activation (VA) in the vastus lateralis muscle with transcranial magnetic stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;) and peripheral nerve stimulation (VA&lt;sub&gt;PNS&lt;/sub&gt;) during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) of the knee extensors in 11 subjects. Measurements were performed before and after a fatiguing cycling time-trial, after an active and a passive recovery treatment and after another fatiguing task (1 min MVC). The measurements were performed a second time 24 h after the time-trial.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We observed a time × group interaction effect for VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; (p = 0.013). Post-hoc corrected T-tests demonstrated an increased VA&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt; after active recovery when measured after the 1 min MVC performed 24 h after the time-trial (mean ± SD; 95.2 ± 4.1% vs. 89.2 ± 6.6%, p = 0.026). No significant effects were observed for all other variables.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Active recovery increased aspects of central, rather than muscle recovery. However, no effect on MVC was seen, implying that even if active recovery speeds up CNS recovery, without affecting the recovery of muscle contractile properties, this doesn´t translate into increases in overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197339</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526320453608</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635fc9d7e8:31a219f:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</originId><origin><title>Biochemistry: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/bichaw</streamId></origin><published>1525924800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Repurposed HisC Aminotransferases Complete the Biosynthesis of Some Methanobactins</title><fingerprint>e66d5083</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/bichaw/0/bichaw.ahead-of-print/acs.biochem.8b00296/20180510/images/medium/bi-2018-00296t_0005.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Biochemistry&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00296&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

p38 has long been known as a central mediator of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in brown adipocytes, which positively regulate the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). However, the physiological role of p38 in adipose tissues, especially the white adipose tissue (WAT), is largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking p38α in adipose tissues display a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, ablation of p38α causes minimal effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult mice, as evident from undetectable changes in UCP-1 expression, mitochondrial function, body temperature (BT), and energy expenditure. In contrast, genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues not only markedly facilitates the browning in WAT upon cold stress but also prevents diet-induced obesity. Consistently, pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α remarkably enhances the browning of WAT and has metabolic benefits. Furthermore, our data suggest that p38α deficiency promotes white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, inhibition of p38α stimulates the UCP-1 transcription through PKA and its downstream cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which form a positive feedback loop that functions to reinforce the white-to-beige phenotypic switch during cold exposure. Together, our study reveals that inhibition of p38α is able to promote WAT browning and confer metabolic benefits. Our study also indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uSUUK1J4vqI&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526060763996</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shengjie Zhang, Hongchao Cao, Yan Li, Yanyan Jing, Shengnan Liu, Cheng Ye, Hui Wang, Shuxian Yu, Chengyuan Peng, Lijian Hui, Yu-cheng Wang, Haibing Zhang, Feifan Guo, Qiwei Zhai, Hui Wang, Ruimin Huang, Ling Zhang, Jingjing Jiang, Wei Liu, Hao Ying&lt;/p&gt;

The adipose tissue (AT) contributes to systemic and B cell intrinsic inflammation, reduced B cell responses and secretion of autoimmune antibodies. In this study we show that adipocytes in the human obese subcutaneous AT (SAT) secrete several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which contribute to the establishment and maintenance of local and systemic inflammation, and consequent suboptimal immune responses in obese individuals, as we have previously shown. We also show that pro-inflammatory chemokines recruit immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors to the SAT, where they also contribute to local and systemic inflammation, secreting additional pro-inflammatory mediators. Moreover, we show that the SAT generates autoimmune antibodies. During the development of obesity, reduced oxygen and consequent hypoxia and cell death lead to further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, “self” protein antigens, cell-free DNA and lipids. All these stimulate class switch and the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies which have been described to be pathogenic. In addition to hypoxia, we have measured cell cytotoxicity and DNA damage mechanisms, which may also contribute to the release of “self” antigens in the SAT. All these processes are significantly elevated in the SAT as compared to the blood. We definitively found that fat-specific IgG antibodies are secreted by B cells in the SAT and that B cells express mRNA for the transcription factor T-bet and the membrane marker CD11c, both involved in the production of autoimmune IgG antibodies. Finally, the SAT also expresses RNA for cytokines known to promote Germinal Center formation, isotype class switch, and plasma cell differentiation. Our results show novel mechanisms for the generation of autoimmune antibody responses in the human SAT and allow the identification of new pathways to possibly manipulate in order to reduce systemic inflammation and autoantibody production in obese individuals.</content></content><author><name>Daniela Frasca</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Daniela Frasca, Alain Diaz, Maria Romero, Seth Thaller, Bonnie B.

Verbal autopsy methods have been developed to determine medical causes of deathforprioritizing disease control programs. Additional information on social causesmay facilitate designing of more appropriate prevention strategies. Use of social autopsy in investigations of causes of adult deaths has been limited. Therefore, acommunity-based study was conducted in NandpurKalour Block of Fatehgarh Sahib District in Punjab (India)for finding social causes of adult deaths. An integrated verbal and social autopsy toolwas developed and verbal autopsies of 600 adult deaths, occurring over a reference period of one year, were conducted in 2014. Quantitative analysis described the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, number and type of consultations from health care providers, and type of care received during illness. Qualitative data was analyzed to find out social causes of death by thematic analysis. The median duration of illness from symptom onset till death was 9 days (IQR = 1–45 days). At the onset of illness, 72 (12%) deceased utilized home remedies and 424 (70.7%)received care from a clinic/hospital, and 104 (17.3%) died withoutreceiving any care. The number of medical consultations varied from one to six (median = 2). The utilization of government health facilities and qualified allopathic doctor increased with each consultation (p value&amp;lt;0.05). The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be ‘mild’ by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality.</content></content><author><name>Mamta Gupta</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mamta Gupta, Manmeet Kaur, P.

Therefore, acommunity-based study was conducted in NandpurKalour Block of Fatehgarh Sahib District in Punjab (India)for finding social causes of adult deaths. An integrated verbal and social autopsy toolwas developed and verbal autopsies of 600 adult deaths, occurring over a reference period of one year, were conducted in 2014. Quantitative analysis described the socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, number and type of consultations from health care providers, and type of care received during illness. Qualitative data was analyzed to find out social causes of death by thematic analysis. The median duration of illness from symptom onset till death was 9 days (IQR = 1–45 days). At the onset of illness, 72 (12%) deceased utilized home remedies and 424 (70.7%)received care from a clinic/hospital, and 104 (17.3%) died withoutreceiving any care. The number of medical consultations varied from one to six (median = 2). The utilization of government health facilities and qualified allopathic doctor increased with each consultation (p value&amp;lt;0.05). The top five social causes of adult deaths in a rural area of Punjab in India. (1) Non availability of medical practitioner in the vicinity, (2) communication gaps between doctor and patient on regular intake of medication, (3) delayed referral by service provider, (4) poor communication with family on illness, and (5) perception of illness to be ‘mild’ by the family or care taker. To conclude, social autopsy tool should be integrated with verbal autopsy tool for identification of individual, community, and health system level factors associated with adult mortality.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198172</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b947:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333625v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Monaco, D.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/30/333625</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/333625v1?rss=1</link><title>Deconvoluting Virome-Wide Antiviral Antibody Profiling Data [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>eea4ddec</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The ability to comprehensively characterize exposures and immune responses to viral infections will be critical to better understanding human health and disease.

Background &lt;p&gt;Empathy is a fundamental humanistic component of patient care which facilitates efficient and patient-centered clinical encounters. Despite being the principal recipient of physician empathy little work on how patients perceive/report receiving empathy from their physicians has been undertaken. In the context of doctor-patient interactions, knowledge about empathy has mostly originated from physicians’ perspectives and has been developed from studies using self-assessment instruments. In general, self-assessment may not correlate well with the reality observed by others.&lt;/p&gt; Objectives &lt;p&gt;To investigate: 1—the relationship between physicians’ self-assessed empathy and patients’ measures of physicians’ empathy; 2 –Environmental factors that could influence patients’ perceptions; and 3 –the correlation between two widely used psychometric scales to measure empathy from the perspective of patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This is an observational study which enrolled 945 patients and 51 physicians from radiology, clinical, and surgical specialties. The physicians completed the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSE) and the International Reactivity Index (IRI), and patients completed the Consultation and Relational Empathy scale (CARE), and the Jefferson Scale of Patient’s Perceptions of Physician Empathy (JSPPPE).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We did not observe any significant correlation between total self-assessed empathy and patients’ perceptions. We observed a small correlation (r = 0,3, P&amp;lt;0,05) between the sub-dimension Perspective Taking-JSE and JSPPPE. JSPPPE and CARE had a positive and moderate correlation (0,56; p&amp;lt;0,001). Physicians’ gender and sector influenced the JSPPPE score.

Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive type of soft tissue tumor that is associated with high rates of metastasis. In the present study, we found that CPI-613, which targets tumorous mitochondrial energy metabolism, induced autophagosome formation followed by lysosome fusion in HS-MM CCS cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, CPI-613 along with chloroquine, which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, significantly induced necrosis of HS-MM CCS cell growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Subsequently, we established a murine orthotropic metastatic model of CCS and evaluated the putative suppressive effect of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on CCS progression. Injection of HS-MM into the aponeuroses of the thigh, the most frequently affected site in CCS, resulted in massive metastasis in SCID-beige mice. By contrast, intraperitoneal administration of CPI-613 (25 mg/kg) and chloroquine (50 mg/kg), two days a week for two weeks, significantly decreased tumor growth at the injection site and abolished metastasis. The present results imply the inhibitory effects of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on the progression of CCS.</content></content><author><name>Yuki Egawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Yuki Egawa, Chiemi Saigo, Yusuke Kito, Toshiaki Moriki, Tamotsu Takeuchi&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;The present study investigated the prognostic role of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in patients with node negative, T1c triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) from a nationwide cohort. In addition, the prognostic effect between 3 different chemotherapy regimens were compared in node-negative T1c TNBC patients by subgroup analysis.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;From the Korean breast cancer registry database, 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients were included in this study. Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Seung Taek Lim</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Seung Taek Lim, Chan Heun Park, Sung Yong Kim, Seok Jin Nam, Eun Young Kang, Byung-In Moon, Hyouk Jin Lee, Ye Won Jeon, Hongki Gwak, Young Jin Suh&lt;/p&gt;

Patients were categorized into four treatment groups according to chemotherapy regimen: (1) no chemotherapy, (2) adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC), (3) adriamycin/epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU (FAC/FEC), and (4) cyclophosphamide plus 5-FU plus methotrexate (CMF). Overall survival (OS) was evaluated between each patient group.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of the 1,151 T1c node negative TNBC patients, 1,006 received adjuvant chemotherapy, while 145 received no chemotherapy. Among the patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy the distribution of regimens was: 586 AC, 168 FAC/FEC (126 FAC, 42 FEC), and 252 CMF. The mean follow-up time of the full study cohort was 87.98 ± 33.56 months (range = 6–192 months). Patients in the no chemotherapy group showed significantly worse OS compared to each chemotherapy regimen group. However, when OS was compared between each chemotherapy regimen, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;This study showed that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improved OS in T1c node negative TNBC patients, regardless of chemotherapy between AC, FAC/FEC, and CMF regimens.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197523</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526492522639</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1636a0b688f:43cc7be:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Systems Biology</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=systems_biology</streamId></origin><author><name>Handel, A.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/22/328559</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/328559v1?rss=1</link><title>Exploring the impact of inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity to inform model-based vaccine design [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>7174121</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases. An important consideration in any vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, i.e., amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen that is used. Higher levels generally lead to better stimulation of the immune response but might cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose. Methods: We designed mathematical models and fit them to data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We used the model to predict the level of immune protection and morbidity for different inoculum doses and to explore what an optimal inoculum dose might be. Results: We show how a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data can be used to study the impact of inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. We find that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and both protection and morbidity do not always increase with increasing inoculum dose. An intermediate inoculum dose can provide the best balance between immune protection and morbidity, though this depends on the specific weighting of protection and morbidity. Conclusions: Once vaccine design goals are specified with required levels of protection and acceptable levels of morbidity, our proposed framework which combines data and models can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum.</content></content><published>1526972400000</published><description>Background: Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases.

The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest. This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3). At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall traps ~25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories: interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species richness and ant community composition within each transect category. Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices. Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably because of the influence of the nature and management of the agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or, to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed between locations, but the most representative guild was ‘generalist’ both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</content></content><author><name>Diego Santana Assis</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Diego Santana Assis, Iracenir Andrade Dos Santos, Flavio Nunes Ramos, Katty Elena Barrios-Rojas, Jonathan David Majer, Evaldo Ferreira Vilela&lt;/p&gt;

Our results are important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as an island of biodiversity in an ‘ocean of crops’.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197697</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527097324678</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1638e17f486:78f2333:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198739</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1528405200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1528405200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198739</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198739</link><title>Systematic metabolic profiling and bioactivity assays for bioconversion of Aceraceae family</title><fingerprint>729499d2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Jinyong Park, Dong Ho Suh, Digar Singh, Sarah Lee, Jong Seok Lee, Choong Hwan Lee&lt;/p&gt;
Plants are an important and inexhaustible source of bioactive molecules in food, medicine, agriculture, and industry. In this study, we performed systematic liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolic profiling coupled with antioxidant assays for indigenous plant family extracts. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of LC-MS datasets for the extracts of 34 plant species belonging to the families Aceraceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae showed that these species were clustered according to their respective phylogenies. In particular, seven Aceraceae species were clearly demarcated with higher average antioxidant activities, rationalizing their application for bioconversion studies. On the basis of further evaluation of the interspecies variability of metabolic profiles and antioxidant activities among Aceraceae family plants, we found that &lt;i&gt;Acer tataricum&lt;/i&gt; (TA) extracts were clearly distinguished from those of other species, with a higher relative abundance of tannin derivatives. Further, we detected a strong positive correlation between most tannin derivatives and the observed higher antioxidant activities. Following &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus oryzae&lt;/i&gt;-mediated fermentative bioconversion of &lt;i&gt;Acer&lt;/i&gt; plant extracts, we observed a time-correlated (0–8 days) linear increase in antioxidant phenotypes for all species, with TA having the highest activity. Temporal analysis of the MS data revealed tannin bioconversion mechanisms with a relatively higher abundance of gallic acid (m/z 169) accumulated at the end of 8 days, particularly in TA. Similarly, quercetin precursor (glycoside) metabolites were also transformed to quercetin aglycones (m/z 301) in most &lt;i&gt;Acer&lt;/i&gt; plant extracts.

Most children and adolescents with chronic health conditions have impaired health-related quality of life and are at high risk of internalizing and externalizing problems. However, few patients present clinically significant symptoms. Using a decision-tree approach, this study aimed to identify risk profiles for psychological problems based on measures that can be easily scored and interpreted by healthcare professionals in pediatric settings. The participants were 736 children and adolescents between 8–18 years of age with asthma, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, type-1diabetes or obesity. The children and adolescents completed self-report measures of health-related quality of life (DISABKIDS-10) and psychological problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected from their parents/ physicians. Children and adolescents were classified into the normal (78.5%) or borderline/clinical range (21.5%) according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire cut-off values for psychological problems. The overall accuracy of the decision-tree model was 78.1% (sensitivity = 71.5%; specificity = 79.9%), with 4 profiles predicting 71.5% of borderline/clinical cases. The strongest predictor of psychological problems was a health-related quality of life standardized score below the threshold of 57.5 for patients with cerebral palsy, epilepsy or obesity and below 70.0 for patients with asthma or diabetes. Other significant predictors were low socio-economic status, single-parent household, medication intake and younger age. The model showed adequate validity (risk = .28, SE = .02) and accuracy (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve = .84; CI = .80/.87). The identification of pediatric patients at high risk for psychological problems may contribute to a more efficient allocation of health resources, particularly with regard to their referral to specialized psychological assessment and intervention.</content></content><author><name>Neuza Silva</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Neuza Silva, Monika Bullinger, Helena Moreira, Maria Cristina Canavarro, Carlos Carona&lt;/p&gt;

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize the conserved molecular patterns in microorganisms and trigger myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and/or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) pathways that are critical for host defense against microbial infection. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern TLR signaling remain incompletely understood. Regulator of calcineurin-1 (RCAN1), a small evolutionarily conserved protein that inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, suppresses inflammation during &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; infection. Here, we define the roles for RCAN1 in &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated TLR4 signaling. We compared the effects of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS challenge on bone marrow-derived macrophages from both wild-type and RCAN1-deficient mice and found that RCAN1 deficiency increased the MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production (IL-6, TNF and MIP-2), whereas TRIF-interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE)-mediated cytokine production (IFNβ, RANTES and IP-10) was suppressed. RCAN1 deficiency caused increased IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity in the MyD88-dependent pathway, but impaired ISRE activation and reduced IRF7 expression in the TRIF-dependent pathway. Complementary studies of a mouse model of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; LPS-induced acute pneumonia confirmed that RCAN1-deficient mice displayed greatly enhanced NF-κB activity and MyD88-NF-κB-mediated cytokine production, which correlated with enhanced pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils. By contrast, RCAN1 deficiency had little effect on the TRIF pathway &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory role of RCAN1 in TLR signaling, which differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF pathways.</content></content><author><name>Zheng Pang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zheng Pang, Robert D.

These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory role of RCAN1 in TLR signaling, which differentially regulates MyD88 and TRIF pathways.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197491</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527270121660</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1639864a0bc:5bcd6b:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</originId><origin><title>American Institute of Physics: The Journal of Chemical Physics: Table of Contents</title><htmlUrl>https://aip.scitation.org/loi/jcp?af=R</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://aip.scitation.org/action/showFeed?type=etoc&amp;feed=rss&amp;jc=jcp</streamId></origin><author><name>Xuan Luo</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><url>none</url></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</link><title>Effects of surface motion and electron-hole pair excitations in CO2 dissociation and scattering on Ni(100)</title><fingerprint>e1b88d9a</fingerprint><description>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://aip.scitation.org/toc/jcp/148/17&quot;&gt;Volume 148, Issue 17&lt;/a&gt;, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></content><published>1525325536000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The Journal of Chemical Physics, Volume 148, Issue 17, May 2018. &lt;br&gt;</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5025029?af=R</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>False</unread><crawled>1525677623336</crawled><id>wdHMcT+LXVZrronR7DXAtbBFiKx7wSwTTgznExQQKDw=_16339790828:2611d9c:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/19/4875.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Daniel L.

Objectives &lt;p&gt;The aims of the study were to identify the associations between multimorbidity and specific physical function domains among community-dwelling adults in Singapore, and to examine sex differences in the associations.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This study was conducted using baseline data of 1,940 participants in the Population Health Index Survey conducted in the Central Region of Singapore from November 2015 to November 2016. Physical function was assessed using the Function Component of the Late-life Function and Disability Instrument and compared between men and women. Multiple linear regressions were conducted to examine associations between multimorbidity and different physical function domains for all participants, and in men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;The prevalence of multimorbidity in the study population was 35.0% for adults aged 21 years and above, with no differences between men and women. Multimorbidity was associated with reduced upper extremity function, basic and advanced lower extremity function, and overall function in men and women after adjusting for demographic factors. Multimorbidity had a stronger association with advanced lower extremity function and overall physical function in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that multimorbidity is associated with physical function domains in men and women, and in particular advanced lower extremity for women. Effective community-based interventions need to be implemented to preserve physical function in individuals with multimorbidity to keep them functionally independent and physically active in the community.

The bacterial soluble lytic transglycosylase (LT) breaks down the peptidoglycan (PG) layer during processes such as cell division. We present here crystal structures of the soluble LT Cj0843 from &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with and without bulgecin A inhibitor in the active site. Cj0843 has a doughnut shape similar but not identical to that of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; SLT70. The C-terminal catalytic domain is preceded by an L-domain, a large helical U-domain, a flexible linker, and a small N-terminal NU-domain. The flexible linker allows the NU-domain to reach over and complete the circular shape, using residues conserved in the Epsilonproteobacteria LT family. The inner surface of the Cj0843 doughnut is mostly positively charged including a pocket that has 8 Arg/Lys residues. Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</content></content><author><name>Jagamya Vijayaraghavan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Jagamya Vijayaraghavan, Vijay Kumar, Nikhil P.

Molecular dynamics simulations with PG strands revealed a potential functional role for this pocket in anchoring the negatively charged terminal tetrapeptide of the PG during several steps in the reaction including homing and aligning the PG strand for exolytic cleavage, and subsequent ratcheting of the PG strand to enhance processivity in degrading PG strands.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197136</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526323322054</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_1635ff59cc6:31f8d4d:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527714000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527714000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198315</link><title>Screening for obstructive sleep apnea among hospital outpatients</title><fingerprint>fabc39ca</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Michel Hug, Katrin Uehli, Stig Solbach, Stefanie Brighenti-Zogg, Selina Dürr, Sabrina Maier, Jörg Daniel Leuppi, David Miedinger&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is common in adults. People with OSAS have a higher risk of experiencing traffic accidents and occupational injuries (OIs). We aimed to clarify the diagnostic performance of a three-channel screening device (ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with the gold standard of full-night attended polysomnography (PSG) among hospital outpatients not referred for sleep-related symptoms. Furthermore, we aimed to determine whether manual revision of the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore enhanced diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We investigated 68 patients with OI and 44 without OI recruited from the University Hospital Basel emergency room, using a cross-sectional study design. Participating patients spent one night at home with ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and within 2 weeks slept for one night at the sleep laboratory. We reanalyzed all ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; data after manual revision.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;We identified significant correlations between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) autoscore and the AHI derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.525; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001) and between the ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) autoscore and that derived by PSG (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.722; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.001). The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82% when comparing AHI ≥5 with the cutoff for AHI and/or ODI ≥15 from PSG. In Bland Altman plots the mean difference between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore and PSG was 2.75 with SD ± 8.80 (β = 0.034), and between ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI revised score and PSG -1.50 with SD ± 9.28 (β = 0.060).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; autoscore demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with the gold standard (full-night attended PSG). However, Bland Altman plots revealed substantial fluctuations between PSG and ApneaLink&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; AHI autoscore respectively manually revised score. This spread for the AHI from a clinical perspective is large, and therefore the results have to be interpreted with caution.

Like many other species of trees native to the Brazilian Mata Atlântica (Atlantic Forest), the Myrtaceae, such as the Red Araza (&lt;i&gt;Psidium cattleianum&lt;/i&gt; Sabine), are widely cited as arbuscular mycorrhizal formers. Nevertheless, recent studies show evidence that Myrtaceae from different tropical, subtropical and neotropical ecosystems can also prompt the formation of ectomycorrhizae, indicating that this species&apos; ectomycorrhizal status should be further explored. Because of this, this research effort studied the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; interaction between the Red Araza and two ectomycorrhizal fungi isolates, belonging to the &lt;i&gt;Pisolithus microcarpus&lt;/i&gt; (D17) and &lt;i&gt;Scleroderma citrinum&lt;/i&gt; (UFSC-Sc133) species. An analysis was performed to determine the formation of ectomycorrhizal structures, or lack thereof, and the developmental differences between the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mycorrhized and non-mycorrhized plants. The analysis proved that indeed an ectomycorrhizal association was developed between the Red Araza, and the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates, a fact never before registered in the existing literature. After an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; period of 110 days, it was confirmed that the D17 and UFSC-Sc133 isolates formed mycorrhizal colonization of 91.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Furthermore, both isolates also promoted root thickening, and the formation of a fungal mantle and a Hartig net. However, when compared to the Control plants, the fungal isolates did not contribute to an increase in the development of the subject plants, possibly due to the specific experimental conditions used, such as a high humidity environment and high availability of nutrients in the symbiotic substrate.</content></content><author><name>Cassio Geremia Freire</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Cassio Geremia Freire, Admir José Giachini, João Peterson Pereira Gardin, Ana Claudia Rodrigues, Renato Luis Vieira, César Milton Baratto, Simone Silmara Werner, Bernardo Haas Abreu&lt;/p&gt;

This paper applies the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method to investigate the long-range correlation of monthly mean temperatures from three typical measurement stations at Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang in Northeast China from 1909 to 2014. The results reveal the memory characteristics of the climate system in this region. By comparing the temperatures from different time periods and investigating the variations of its scaling exponents at the three stations during these different time periods, we found that the monthly mean temperature has long-range correlation, which indicates that the temperature in Northeast China has long-term memory and good predictability. The monthly time series of temperatures over the past 106 years also shows good long-range correlation characteristics. These characteristics are also obviously observed in the annual mean temperature time series. Finally, we separated the centennial-length temperature time series into two time periods. These results reveal that the long-range correlations at the Harbin station over these two time periods have large variations, whereas no obvious variations are observed at the other two stations. This indicates that warming affects the regional climate system’s predictability differently at different time periods. The research results can provide a quantitative reference point for regional climate predictability assessment and future climate model evaluation.</content></content><author><name>Xiaohui Zheng</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaohui Zheng, Yi Lian, Qiguang Wang&lt;/p&gt;

The smooth hammerhead shark, &lt;i&gt;Sphyrna zygaena&lt;/i&gt;, is a cosmopolitan semipelagic shark captured as bycatch in pelagic oceanic fisheries, especially pelagic longlines targeting swordfish and/or tunas. From 2012 to 2016, eight smooth hammerheads were tagged with Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags in the inter-tropical region of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, with successful transmissions received from seven tags (total of 319 tracking days). Results confirmed the smooth hammerhead is a highly mobile species, as the longest migration ever documented for this species (&gt; 6600 km) was recorded. An absence of a diel vertical movement behavior was noted, with the sharks spending most of their time at surface waters (0–50 m) above 23°C. The operating depth of the pelagic longline gear was measured with Minilog Temperature and Depth Recorders, and the overlap with the species vertical distribution was calculated. The overlap is taking place mainly during the night and is higher for juveniles (~40% of overlap time).

Haploinsufficiency, a dominant phenotype caused by a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation, has been rarely observed. However, high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping of yeast morphological characteristics revealed haploinsufficiency phenotypes for more than half of 1,112 essential genes under optimal growth conditions. Additionally, 40% of the essential genes with no obvious phenotype under optimal growth conditions displayed haploinsufficiency under severe growth conditions. Haploinsufficiency was detected more frequently in essential genes than in nonessential genes. Similar haploinsufficiency phenotypes were observed mostly in mutants with heterozygous deletion of functionally related genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency phenotypes were caused by functional defects of the genes. A global view of the gene network was presented based on the similarities of the haploinsufficiency phenotypes. Our dataset contains rich information regarding essential gene functions, providing evidence that single-cell phenotyping is a powerful approach, even in the heterozygous condition, for analyzing complex biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/T_6m60ob9nc&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1526493065517</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shinsuke Ohnuki, Yoshikazu Ohya&lt;/p&gt;

In the present study, we show that proton-driven lactate flux is enhanced by the intracellular carbonic anhydrase CAII, which is colocalized with the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Co-expression of MCTs with various CAII mutants in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes demonstrated that CAII facilitates MCT transport activity in a process involving CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72, which could function as surface proton antennae for the enzyme. CAII-Glu69 and CAII-Asp72 seem to mediate proton transfer between enzyme and transporter, but CAII-His64, the central residue of the enzyme’s intramolecular proton shuttle, is not involved in proton shuttling between the two proteins. Instead, this residue mediates binding between MCT and CAII. Taken together, the results suggest that CAII features a moiety that exclusively mediates proton exchange with the MCT to facilitate transport activity.</description><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163abdaa2b2:1ef99cc:2835af05</id><published>1527552000000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Many tumor cells produce vast amounts of lactate and acid, which have to be removed from the cell to prevent intracellular lactacidosis and suffocation of metabolism.

Taken together, the results suggest that CAII features a moiety that exclusively mediates proton exchange with the MCT to facilitate transport activity.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35176</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Biochemistry and Chemical Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1527596622514</crawled><author><name>Holger.Becker@tiho-hannover.de (Holger M Becker)</name></author></item><item><originId>http://www.pnas.org/content/115/20/5151.short?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences recent issues</title><htmlUrl>http://www.pnas.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.pnas.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><author><name>Pratha Sah, Jan Medlock, Meagan C.

Despite progress toward automated force field parameterization, considerable human expertise is required to develop or extend force fields. In particular, human input has long been required to define atom types, which encode chemically unique environments that determine which parameters must be assigned. However, relying on humans to establish atom types is suboptimal: the resulting atom types are often unjustified from a statistical perspective, leading to over- or under-fitting; they are difficult to extend in a systematic and consistent manner when new chemistries must be modeled or new data becomes available; and human effort is not scalable when force fields must be generated for new (bio)polymers or materials. We aim to replace human specification of atom types with an automated approach, based on solid statistics and driven by experimental and/or quantum chemical reference data. Here, we describe a novel technology for this purpose, termed SMARTY, which generalizes atom typing by using direct chemical perception with SMARTS strings, and adopting a hierarchical approach to type assignment. The SMARTY technology enables creation of a move set in atom-typing space that can be used in a Monte Carlo optimization approach to atom typing. We demonstrate the power of this approach with a fully automated procedure that is able to re-discover human-defined atom types in the traditional small molecule force field parm99/parm@Frosst. Furthermore, we show how an extension of this approach that makes use of SMIRKS strings to match multiple atoms, which we term SMIRKY, allows us to take full advantage of the advances in direct chemical perception for valence types (bonds, angles, and torsions) afforded by the recently-proposed SMIRNOFF direct chemical perception force field typing language. We assess these approaches using several molecular datasets, including one which covers a diverse molecular subset from DrugBank.</description><published>1525824000000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>Molecular mechanics force fields define how the energy and forces of a molecular system are computed from its atomic positions, and enable the study of such systems through computational methods like molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.

Our results indicate that the optimal value of lysogenic propensity is greatly dependent on the intensity of these stresses.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/321372v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526399033629</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_1636478e11d:3887d3f:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/616.2.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</link><title>Stress granule transcription</title><fingerprint>96ddfc2</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7ce:93d646dc</id><author><name>Mao, S.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/616-b?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/610?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/610.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>19</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/610?rss=1</link><title>Open minds</title><fingerprint>d8ced545</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7e7:93d646dc</id><author><name>Pohl, N.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/610?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1526677200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1526677200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197669</link><title>Widespread anatoxin-a detection in benthic cyanobacterial mats throughout a river network</title><fingerprint>b40a272a</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Keith Bouma-Gregson, Raphael M.

Benthic algae fuel summer food webs in many sunlit rivers, and are hotspots for primary and secondary production and biogeochemical cycling. Concerningly, riverine benthic algal assemblages can become dominated by toxic cyanobacteria, threatening water quality and public health. In the Eel River in Northern California, over a dozen dog deaths have been attributed to cyanotoxin poisonings since 2000. During the summers of 2013–2015, we documented spatial and temporal patterns of cyanotoxin concentrations in the watershed, showing widespread distribution of anatoxin-a in benthic cyanobacterial mats. Solid phase adsorption toxin tracking (SPATT) samplers were deployed weekly to record dissolved microcystin and anatoxin-a levels at 10 sites throughout the watershed, and 187 &lt;i&gt;Anabaena&lt;/i&gt;-dominated or &lt;i&gt;Phormidium-&lt;/i&gt;dominated cyanobacterial mat samples were collected from 27 locations to measure intracellular anatoxin-a (ATX) and microcystins (MCY). Anatoxin-a levels were higher than microcystin for both SPATT (mean MCY = 0.8 and ATX = 4.8 ng g resin&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and cyanobacterial mat samples (mean MCY = 0.074 and ATX = 1.89 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW). Of the benthic mats sampled, 58.9% had detectable anatoxin-a (max = 70.93 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), while 37.6% had detectable microcystins (max = 2.29 μg g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW).

Pigeon racing is a popular sport worldwide. Pigeons are under continuous selection to improve speed, spatial orientation, and endurance during long flights. However, numerous genetic and non-genetic factors affect survivability and homing ability, making such traits difficult for breeders to control. Polymorphisms in the lactate dehydrogenase A gene (&lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt;) likely affects pigeon racing and homing abilities, due to its role in physical and mental performance. Additionally, the adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1 gene (&lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt;) has been associated with physiological and behavioral shifts that occur during avian migration. In this study, we examined the association between &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; genotypes with pigeon survivability during racing competitions. Survivability was evaluated through the estimated breeding value (EBV) of each individual’s total race distances during its athletic life. &lt;i&gt;ADCYAP1&lt;/i&gt; was not polymorphic among our samples, while &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; genotypes were significantly associated with deviated EBV values of longer total race distance; individuals carrying the &lt;i&gt;S+&lt;/i&gt; genotype had higher EBV (i.e., greater survivability). Thus, the &lt;i&gt;LDHA&lt;/i&gt; locus might be useful for marker-assisted selection, empowering breeders and trainers to maximize pigeon quality. Moreover, data obtained from breeding will also improve our understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying navigation and flight for wild migrating bird species.</content></content><author><name>Sherif Ramadan</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Sherif Ramadan, Takeshi Miyake, Junichi Yamaura, Miho Inoue-Murayama&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Several specialty societies participate in the Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign in an attempt to reduce waste in health care spending.

A 10-question, case-based multiple choice test, with each question accompanied by a 5-point Likert-scale confidence assessment, was distributed electronically. Responses were summarized with frequencies and percentages or medians and ranges, as appropriate. Two sample t-tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare confidence and knowledge scores.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Of 892 IM residents, 174 (19.5%) responded to all questions. Overall, residents answered a median of 7 of 10 questions correctly (range 2–10) and median resident confidence in their responses was 3.1 (on a 5-point scale). Correct responses were significantly associated with higher confidence for all but one question. Having a hematology rotation experience was significantly associated with more correct responses and with higher confidence (&lt;i&gt;p = 0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p&amp;lt;0&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;001&lt;/i&gt;, respectively).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;IM residents at several academic hospitals have variable knowledge of ASH-CW guidelines in thrombosis and hemostasis/non-malignant hematology.

Cryptopain1, a cysteine protease characterized in the genome of Cryptosporidium parvum, had been earlier shown to be inhibited by a vinyl sulfone compound called K11777 (or K777). Cysteine proteases have long been established as valid drug targets, which can be covalently and selectively inhibited by vinyl sulfones. This computational study was initiated to identify purchasable vinyl sulfone compounds, which could possibly inhibit cryptopain1 with higher efficacy than K11777. Docking simulations screened a number of such possibly better inhibitors. The work was furthered to probe the enzymatic pocket of cryptopain1, through in-silico mutations, to derive a map of receptor-ligand interactions in the docked complexes. The idea was to provide crucial clues to aid the design of inhibitors, which would be able to bind the protease well by making favorable interactions with important residues of the enzyme. The analyses dictated placement of ligands towards the front of the enzymatic cleft, and disfavored interactions deep within. The S1 prime and S2 subsites of the enzyme preferred to remain occupied by polar ligand subgroups. Reasonably distanced ring systems and polar backbones of ligands were desired across the cleft. Large as well as inflexible subgroups were not tolerated. Double ringed systems such as substituted napthalene, especially in S1, were exceptions though.

Background &lt;p&gt;Developing more effective strategies to prevent relapse remains one of the major challenges of treating substance dependence. Previous studies have identified brain abnormalities in abstinent alcoholics. However, whether these persistent brain deficits in abstinence could predict early relapse to alcohol use has not been well established. This study aimed to identify biomarkers of relapse vulnerability by investigating persistent brain abnormalities in abstinent alcohol-dependent patients.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;Brain imaging and impulsive behavior data were collected from 56 abstinent alcohol-dependent male inpatients and 33 age-matched male healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the differences of grey matter volume between the groups. The resting-state functional connectivity was examined using brain areas with gray matter deficits as seed regions. A preliminary prospective study design was used to classify patients into abstainers and relapsers after a 62-day average abstinence period.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Compared with healthy controls, both relapsers and abstainers exhibited significantly reduced gray matter volume in the cuneus. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that relapsers relative to abstainers demonstrated increased cuneus-centered negative functional connectivity within a network of brain regions which are involved in executive control and salience. Abnormal gray matter volume in the left cuneus and the functional connectivity between the right cuneus and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex could successfully predict relapse during the 3-month follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that the abnormal gray matter volume in the cuneus and resting-state cuneus-prefrontal functional connectivity may play an important role in poor treatment outcomes in alcoholics and serve as useful neural markers of relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Junkai Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Junkai Wang, Yunli Fan, Yue Dong, Mengying Ma, Yuru Dong, Yajuan Niu, Yin Jiang, Hong Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Liuzhen Wu, Hongqiang Sun, Cailian Cui&lt;/p&gt;

In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention.

In cases of impending natural disasters, most events are uncertain and emotionally relevant, both critical factors for decision-making. Moreover, for exposed individuals, the sensitivity to the framing of the consequences (gain or loss) and the moral judgments they have to perform (e.g., evacuate or help an injured person) constitute two central effects that have never been examined in the same context of decision-making. In a framed decision-making task with moral dilemma, we investigated whether uncertainty (i.e., unpredictably of events) and a threatening context would influence the framing effect (actions framed in loss are avoided in comparison to the ones framed in gain) and the personal intention effect (unintentional actions are more morally acceptable in comparison to intentional actions) on the perceived moral acceptability of taking action. Considering the impact of uncertainty and fear on the processes underlying these effects, we assumed that these emotions would lead to the negation of the two effects. Our results indicate that the exposure to uncertain events leads to the negation of the framing effect, but does not influence the moral acceptability and the effect of personal intention. We discuss our results in the light of dual-process models (i.e. systematic &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt;. heuristic), appraisal theories, and neurocognitive aspects. These elements highlight the importance of providing solutions to cope with uncertainty, both for scientists and local populations exposed to natural hazards.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197923</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527702122317</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b2246f4d:28bb916:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0197880</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527109200000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527109200000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197880</canonicalUrl><engagement>1</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0197880</link><title>Comparison of the validity of smear and culture conversion as a prognostic marker of treatment outcome in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis</title><fingerprint>6e2efdd2</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kefyalew Addis Alene, Kerri Viney, Hengzhong Yi, Emma S.

Background &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has conditionally recommended the use of sputum smear microscopy and culture examination for the monitoring of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment. We aimed to assess and compare the validity of smear and culture conversion at different time points during treatment for MDR-TB, as a prognostic marker for end-of-treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We undertook a retrospective observational cohort study using data obtained from Hunan Chest Hospital, China and Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia. The sensitivity and specificity of culture and sputum smear conversion for predicting treatment outcomes were analysed using a random-effects generalized linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 429 bacteriologically confirmed MDR-TB patients with a culture and smear positive result were included. Overall, 345 (80%) patients had a successful treatment outcome, and 84 (20%) patients had poor treatment outcomes. The sensitivity of smear and culture conversion to predict a successful treatment outcome were: 77.9% and 68.9% at 2 months after starting treatment (difference between tests, p = 0.007); 95.9% and 92.7% at 4 months (p = 0.06); 97.4% and 96.2% at 6 months (p = 0.386); and 99.4% and 98.9% at 12 months (p = 0.412), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture non-conversion to predict a poor treatment outcome were: 41.6% and 60.7% at 2 months (p = 0.012); 23.8% and 48.8% at 4 months (p&amp;lt;0.001); and 20.2% and 42.8% at 6 months (p&amp;lt;0.001); and 15.4% and 32.1% (p&amp;lt;0.001) at 12 months, respectively. The sensitivity of culture and smear conversion increased as the month of conversion increased but at the cost of decreased specificity. The optimum time points after conversion to provide the best prognostic marker of a successful treatment outcome were between two and four months after treatment commencement for smear, and between four and six months for culture. The common optimum time point for smear and culture conversion was four months. At this time point, culture conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.71) was significantly better than smear conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.6) in predicting successful treatment outcomes (p &amp;lt; 0.001). However, the validity of smear conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.7) was equivalent to culture conversion (AU&lt;sub&gt;ROC&lt;/sub&gt; curve = 0.71) in predicting treatment outcomes when demographic and clinical factors were included in the model. The positive and negative predictive values for smear conversion were: 57.3% and 65.7% at two months, 55.7% and 85.4% at four months, and 55.0% and 88.6% at six months; and for culture conversions it was: 63.7% and 66.2% at two months, 64.4% and 87.1% at four months, and 62.7% and 91.9% at six months, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The validity of smear conversion is significantly lower than culture conversion in predicting MDR-TB treatment outcomes. We support the WHO recommendation of using both smear and culture examination rather than smear alone for the monitoring of MDR-TB patients for a better prediction of successful treatment outcomes. The optimum time points to predict a future successful treatment outcome were between two and four months after treatment commencement for sputum smear conversion and between four and six months for culture conversion. The common optimum times for culture and smear conversion together was four months.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Kefyalew Addis Alene</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Kefyalew Addis Alene, Kerri Viney, Hengzhong Yi, Emma S.

Plant hormones play important roles in regulating every aspect of growth, development, and metabolism of plants. We are interested in understanding hormonal regulation of floret opening and closure in plants. This is a particularly important problem for hybrid rice because regulation of flowering time is vitally important in hybrid rice seed production. However, little was known about the effects of plant hormones on rice flowering. We have shown that jasmonate and methyl jasmonate play significant roles in promoting rice floret opening. In this study, we investigated the effects of auxins including indole-3-acidic acid (IAA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), 1-naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) and 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (DIC) and abscisic acid (ABA) on floret closure of four fertile and three sterile varieties of rice. The results from field studies in three growing seasons in 2013–2015 showed that the percentages of closed florets were significantly lower in plants treated with IAA, IBA, 2,4-D, DIC and NAA and that the durations of floret opening were significantly longer in plants treated with the same auxins. The auxins exhibited time- and concentration-dependant effects on floret closure. ABA displayed opposite effects of auxins because it increased the percentages of floret closure and decreased the length of floret opening of rice varieties. The degree of auxin-inhibiting and ABA-promoting effects on floret closure was varied somewhat but not significantly different among the rice varieties. Endogenous IAA levels were the highest in florets collected shortly before opening followed by a sharp decline in florets with maximal angles of opening and a significant jump of IAA levels shortly after floret closure in both fertile and sterile rice plants. ABA levels showed an opposite trend in the same samples. Our results showed that auxins delayed but ABA promoted the closure of rice floret regardless of the varieties.</content></content><author><name>Youming Huang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youming Huang, Xiaochun Zeng, Heping Cao&lt;/p&gt;

Consumption of different PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) can induce functional changes in blood vessels via endothelial cells, which interact with dietary factors in the circulation. The basement membrane that separates the endothelium from the smooth muscle cells of the medial layer can also influence the functional state of endothelial cells. However, the effect of basement membrane on the endothelial response to dietary PUFAs in relation to growth state (e.g. proliferation versus quiescence) has never been investigated. We therefore compared the viability (CCK kit) and proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation) of EA.hy926 endothelial cells grown on Matrigel or collagen versus non-coated plates. EA.hy926 viability and proliferation were also assessed after treatment with 0–150 μM of PUFAs [linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. Our study showed that only cells grown on Matrigel-coated plates reached quiescence after becoming confluent with a decreased level of MCM2 and p-cyclin D1 (T286), increased levels of p27kip1 and a low level of apoptosis and senescence. AA, EPA and DHA decreased the viability and proliferation of subconfluent cells grown on plastic dishes in a dose-dependent manner, while the presence of Matrigel made the cells resistant to these adverse effects. Confluent cell viability was less sensitive to higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA than subconfluent cells, and a significant increase in caspase-3 cleavage was only observed in confluent cells treated with DHA. Higher concentrations of AA, EPA and DHA suppressed DNA synthesis by both subconfluent and confluent cells, while precursor C18 PUFAs (LA and ALA) had no negative effects on viability and proliferation. Our study is the first to show that extracellular matrix and growth state are important factors in the EA.hy926 cell response to PUFAs, and that the mechanisms by which individual PUFAs operate may be growth state-dependent.</content></content><author><name>Youjia Du</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Youjia Du, Carla G.

Lumbar spinal stenosis causes cauda equina and nerve root compression, resulting in neurological symptoms. Although trunk flexion during level walking may alleviate these symptoms by enabling spinal canal decompression, some patients do not use this strategy. We aimed to identify the kinetic and kinematic variables that affect trunk flexion in patients during level walking. Gait was recorded in 111 patients using a three-dimensional motion capture system and six force plates. From the data recorded, walking velocity, bilateral step length, cycle time, maximum trunk flexion angle, forward pelvic tilt angle, pelvic rotation angle, maximum and minimum joint angles, and moment and power of the lower limb were calculated. Then a step-wise multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify kinetic and kinematic variables affecting trunk flexion. The maximum hip extension angle (β = 0.416), maximum hip flexion moment (β = -0.348), and step length (β = 0.257) were identified as variables significantly affecting the trunk flexion angle. The coefficient of determination adjusted for the degree of freedom was 0.294 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that patients with lumbar spinal stenosis choose one of two strategies to alleviate symptoms during walking. One strategy is gait with trunk flexion posture to increase step length and hip extension angle. The other strategy is gait with trunk upright posture to decrease step length and hip extension angle.</content></content><author><name>Tatsuya Igawa</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tatsuya Igawa, Junji Katsuhira, Akira Hosaka, Kenta Uchikoshi, Shinichi Ishihara, Ko Matsudaira&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;When attempting to statistically distinguish between a null and an alternative hypothesis, many researchers in the life and social sciences turn to binned statistical analysis methods, or methods that are simply based on the moments of a distribution (such as the mean, and variance). These methods have the advantage of simplicity of implementation, and simplicity of explanation.However, when null and alternative hypotheses manifest themselves in subtle differences in patterns in the data, binned analysis methods may be insensitive to these differences, and researchers may erroneously fail to reject the null hypothesis when in fact more sensitive statistical analysis methods might produce a different result when the null hypothesis is actually false.Here, with a focus on two recent conflicting studies of contagion in mass killings as instructive examples, we discuss how the use of unbinned likelihood methods makes optimal use of the information in the data; a fact that has been long known in statistical theory, but perhaps is not as widely appreciated amongst general researchers in the life and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Towers &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt; published a paper that quantified the long-suspected contagion effect in mass killings. However, in 2017, Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek subsequently published a paper, based upon the same data, that claimed to contradict the results of the earlier study. The former used unbinned likelihood methods, and the latter used binned methods, and comparison of distribution moments.Using these analyses, we also discuss how visualization of the data can aid in determination of the most appropriate statistical analysis methods to distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis. We also discuss the importance of assessment of the robustness of analysis results to methodological assumptions made (for example, arbitrary choices of number of bins and bin widths when using binned methods); an issue that is widely overlooked in the literature, but is critical to analysis reproducibility and robustness.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;When an analysis cannot distinguish between a null and alternate hypothesis, care must be taken to ensure that the analysis methodology itself maximizes the use of information in the data that can distinguish between the two hypotheses.The use of binned methods by Lankford &amp;amp; Tomek (2017), that examined how many mass killings fell within a 14 day window from a previous mass killing, substantially reduced the sensitivity of their analysis to contagion effects.

Hypoxia-mediated pancreatic beta cell death is one of the main causes of pancreatic beta celldeath, which leads to the loss of functional pancreatic beta cell mass and type 1 diabetes andtype 2 diabetes.However, the molecular mechanisms that control life and death of pancreatic beta cells remain poorly understood. Here we showed that mitochondrial fission was strongly induced in pancreatic beta cellsmainly due to an elevation of DRP1&lt;sup&gt;S616&lt;/sup&gt; phosphorylation through HIF-1αactivation and subsequent DRP1 mitochondrial translocation. Hypoxia-induced pancreatic beta cell death can be reversed by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission viaDRP1 knockdown. We further demonstrated that hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission untightened the cristae formation, which subsequently triggers mitochondrial cytochrome c release and consequent caspase activation. Moreover, treatment with mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1), a specific inhibitor of DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission, significantly suppressedbeta cell death in vitro, indicating a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of diabetes.Taken together, our results reveal a crucial role for the DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission in hypoxia-induced beta cell death, which provides a strong evidence for thisprocess as drug target indiabetestreatment.</content></content><author><name>Da Zhang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhang, Yanfang Liu, Yao Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Zhichao Li, Rui Li, Zhenyu Ti, Weidong Gao, Jigang Bai, Yi Lv&lt;/p&gt;

Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6393/1113?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Physics, Applied, Physics</item></keywords><crawled>1528398419859</crawled><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163dba51793:6879dcd:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04105-y</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Haoxiang Li</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><visual><height>231</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>685</width><url>https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-04105-y/MediaObjects/41467_2018_4105_Fig1_HTML.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04105-y</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04105-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10</title><fingerprint>c4fa7938</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&amp;lt;sub&gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&gt;Ni&amp;lt;sub&gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;lt;sub&gt;10&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 11 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04105-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04105-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/H5HlyAYq9AM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1526022000000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&amp;lt;sub&gt;4&amp;lt;/sub&gt;Ni&amp;lt;sub&gt;3&amp;lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;lt;sub&gt;10&amp;lt;/sub&gt;, Published online: 11 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04105-y&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04105-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Fermiology and electron dynamics of trilayer nickelate La&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/H5HlyAYq9AM&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><alternate><item><href>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~3/H5HlyAYq9AM/s41467-018-04105-y</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526030916879</crawled><id>jwXlck1dDuZkRMiQieilKprXSaqkYbbYUBRtrvL+pQ0=_1634e87dd0f:1a2559a:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00223</originId><origin><title>Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/jctcce</streamId></origin><published>1527048000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00223</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00223</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Configuration-Sampling-Based Surrogate Models for Rapid Parameterization of Non-Bonded Interactions</title><fingerprint>249648e2</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/jctcce/0/jctcce.ahead-of-print/acs.jctc.8b00223/20180523/images/medium/ct-2018-002236_0011.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00223&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

Introduction &lt;p&gt;A number of video-fluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) abnormalities have been reported in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the most crucial finding of subsequent aspiration pneumonia has not been validated fully. We conducted a retrospective and case-control study to determine the clinically significant VFSS findings in this population, and to propose a practical scale for predicting aspiration pneumonia in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We enrolled 184 PD patients who underwent VFSS because of suspected dysphagia. The patients who developed aspiration pneumonia within six months of the VFSS were assigned as cases and the patients without aspiration pneumonia at six months were designated as controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the prognostic VFSS features based on the data of swallowing 3 mL of jelly, which were used to make a PD VFSS scale (PDVFS). The validity of the new PDVFS was evaluated by ROC analysis. Additionally, we used the survival time analysis to compare time to death between groups, stratified by the PDVFS score.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five patients developed aspiration pneumonia. Among the previously-proposed VFSS features, mastication, lingual motility prior to transfer, aspiration, and total swallow time were identified as significant prognostic factors. We combined these factors to form the PDVFS. The PDVFS score ranges from 0 to 12, with 12 being the worst. ROC analysis revealed 92% sensitivity and 82% specificity at a cutoff point of 3. The higher PDVFS group showed shorter time-to-death than the lower PDVFS group (log rank P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Our newly developed VFSS severity scale (based on jelly swallowing) for patients with PD was easy to rate and could predict subsequent aspiration pneumonia and poor prognosis in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Satoshi Tomita</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Satoshi Tomita, Tomoko Oeda, Atsushi Umemura, Masayuki Kohsaka, Kwiyoung Park, Kenji Yamamoto, Hiroshi Sugiyama, Hideyuki Sawada&lt;/p&gt;

Although it has been recognized that intestinal bacteria play an important role in the pathology of human ulcerative colitis (UC), specific pathogenic bacteria for UC have not been identified. We investigated the influence of &lt;i&gt;Paraclostridium bifermentans&lt;/i&gt; PAGU1678 strain on the pathology of a UC mouse model and found it increased UC pathosis scores such as loose and bloody stools, reduced diversity of fecal flora, disappearance of the crypt structure of distal colon tissue, destruction of intestinal epithelial cells, and atrophy of the colon.

Perinatal depression is common, and left untreated can have significant and long-lasting consequences for women, their children and their families. Migrant women are at particular risk of perinatal depression as a result of a multitude of stressors experienced before, during and after migration. Identification of perinatal depression among migrant women—particularly those living in low- and middle-income regions—remains challenging, partly due to the lack of locally-validated and culturally appropriate screens tools. This study formally validates Burmese and Sgaw Karen versions of the &lt;i&gt;Refugee Health Screener-15&lt;/i&gt; (RHS-15) as a screening tool for perinatal depression among migrant women living on the Thai-Myanmar border. The &lt;i&gt;Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnosis of DSM-IV Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (SCID) was used as the gold-standard comparator. Complete results were obtained for 235 Burmese-speaking and 275 Sgaw Karen-speaking women. Despite displaying reasonable psychometric properties, a number of shortcomings associated with the RHS-15 limited its utility in this setting. The Likert-type response categories of the RHS-15 proved problematic in this low-literacy population. Combined with the relative superiority and greater ease of administration of the SCID, the RHS-15 is not recommended as the tool of choice for detecting perinatal depression in this setting.</content></content><author><name>Gracia Fellmeth</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Gracia Fellmeth, Emma Plugge, Mina Fazel, Prakaykaew Charunwattana, François Nosten, Raymond Fitzpatrick, Julie A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance &amp;lt; 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p &amp;lt; 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model.

These experiments, motivated by a hypothesized mechanism of folding, and the first of their kind, are consistent with folding to metastable but not necessarily equilibrium structures.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329698v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527257340872</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_16397a19bc8:459997:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05133-w</originId><origin><title>Nature</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nature/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nature/current_issue/rss</streamId></origin><author><name>Alison Abbott</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>249</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05133-w</link><unread>True</unread><title>AI recreates activity patterns that brain cells use in navigation</title><fingerprint>18c772c3</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI recreates activity patterns that brain cells use in navigation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI recreates activity patterns that brain cells use in navigation, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05133-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05133-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deep-learning algorithm spontaneously mimicked the activity of specialized neurons that tell us where we are in space.</content></content><published>1525849200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI recreates activity patterns that brain cells use in navigation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI recreates activity patterns that brain cells use in navigation, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05133-w&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-018-05133-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Deep-learning algorithm spontaneously mimicked the activity of specialized neurons that tell us where we are in space.</description><alternate><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05133-w</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><id>BJi9nUvd4jCSd9rf0lPNeaPIDvhjO/Py+q6EVKn1X88=_16345ecdb93:ccb244:3dd877af</id><crawled>1525886540691</crawled><visual><height>576</height><processor>feedly-nikon-v3.1</processor><width>1024</width><url>https://media.nature.com/lw1024/magazine-assets/d41586-018-05133-w/d41586-018-05133-w_15749204.jpg</url><contentType>image/jpeg</contentType></visual></item><item><originId>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01138</originId><origin><title>Molecular Pharmaceutics: Latest Articles (ACS Publications)</title><htmlUrl>https://pubs.acs.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/acs/mpohbp</streamId></origin><published>1527134400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01138</link><canonical><item><href>http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01138</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>[ASAP] Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promoted Cutaneous Wound Healing by Regulating Keratinocyte Migration via ß2-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling</title><fingerprint>5429db8a</fingerprint><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;TOC Graphic&quot; src=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/mpohbp/0/mpohbp.ahead-of-print/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01138/20180524/images/medium/mp-2017-011386_0008.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Molecular Pharmaceutics&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DOI: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.7b01138&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;

The insect-transmitted protozoan parasite &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; experiences changes in nutrient availability and rate of flux through different metabolic pathways across its life cycle. The species encompasses much genetic diversity of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes among isolated strains. The genetic or expression variation of both genomes are likely to impact metabolic responses to environmental stimuli, and even steady state metabolic function, among strains. To begin formal characterization these differences, we compared aspects of metabolism between genetically similar strains CL Brener and Tulahuen with less similar Esmeraldo and Sylvio X10 strains in a culture environment. Epimastigotes of all strains took up glucose at similar rates. However, the degree of medium acidification that could be observed when glucose was absent from the medium varied by strain, indicating potential differences in excreted metabolic byproducts. Our main focus was differences related to electron transport chain function. We observed differences in ATP-coupled respiration and maximal respiratory capacity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial morphology between strains, despite the fact that abundances of two nuclear-encoded proteins of the electron transport chain are similar between strains. RNA sequencing reveals strain-specific differences in abundances of mRNAs encoding proteins of the respiratory chain but also other metabolic processes. From these differences in metabolism and mitochondrial phenotypes we have generated tentative models for the differential metabolic fluxes or differences in gene expression that may underlie these results.</content></content><author><name>Murat C.

Initially designed to identify children’s movement impairments in clinical settings, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) is also widely used to evaluate children’s movement in research. Standardised scores on the test are calculated using parametric methods under the assumption of normally-distributed data. In a pilot study with thirty five 8–10 year old children (i.e., in Age Band 2 of the MABC-2), we found that maximal performance was often reached. These ‘ceiling effects’ created distributions of scores that may violate parametric assumptions. Tests of normality, skew, and goodness-of-fit revealed this violation, most clearly on three of the eight sub-tests. A strong deviation from normality was again observed in a sample of 161 children (8–10 years, Experiment 1), however ceiling effects were reduced by modifying the scoring methods, and administering items designed for older children when maximal performance was reached. Experiment 2 (n = 81, 7–10 years) further refined the administration and scoring methods, and again improved the distributions of scores. Despite reducing ceiling effects, scores remained non-parametrically distributed, justifying non-parametric analytic approaches. By randomly and repeatedly resampling from the raw data, we generated non-parametric reference distributions for assigning percentiles to each child’s performance, and compared the results with the standardised scores. Distributions of scores obtained with both parametric and non-parametric methods were skewed, and the methods resulted in different rankings of the same data. Overall, we demonstrate that some MABC-2 item scores are not normally-distributed, and violate parametric assumptions. Changes in administering and scoring may partially address these issues. We propose that resampling or other non-parametric methods are required to create new reference distributions to which an individual child’s performance can be referred. The modifications we propose are preliminary, but the implication is that a new standardisation is required to deal with the non-parametric data acquired with the MABC-2 performance test.</content></content><author><name>Blandine French</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Blandine French, Nicole J.

Objective &lt;p&gt;Metabolic disturbances induce endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in pancreatic beta cells. This study aims to investigate whether a common pathway exists in the ERS induced by various chemicals, including high levels of glucose and palmitate in INS-1-3 cells.&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;ERS in INS-1-3 cells was induced by exposure cells to thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM) or palmitic acid (PA) +high glucose (HG). Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling technique was used to detect differentially expressed genes. The profile of gene expression was detected by gene oncology (GO) function and pathway enrichment analysis. Nkx6.1 over-expression was established in INS-1-3 cell lines by lentivirus infection to revert the inhibition of Nkx6.1 expression found in the situation of ERS. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the expression changes of key genes. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. INS-1-3 cell function was measured by glucose stimulated insulin secretion test(GSIS).&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;As compared to control, DGE demonstrated that there were 135, 57 and 74 differentially expressed genes in TM, TG and HG+PA groups, respectively. Those differentially expressed genes were enriched to ERS, antigen processing and presentation, protein export pathways, and interestingly, the maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) pathway. Nkx6.1 is one of common down-regulated gene in MODY signaling pathway among TM, TG and HG+PA groups. Over-expression of Nkx6.1 ameliorated glucolipotoxicity induced apoptosis rate by 45.4%, and increased proliferation by 40.9%. At the same time, GSIS increased by 1.82 folds.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;MODY pathway genes expression was changed in the state of ERS.

Surgical site infections (SSI) are amongst the most common health care-associated infections and have adverse effects for patient health and for hospital resources. Although surgery guidelines recognize poor nutritional status to be a risk factor for SSI, they do not tell how to identify this condition. The screening tool Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 is commonly used at hospitals to identify patients at nutritional risk. We investigated the association between nutritional risk and the incidence of SSI among 1194 surgical patients at Haukeland University Hospital (Bergen, Norway). This current study combines data from two mandatory hospital-based registers: a) the incidence of SSI within 30 days after surgery, and b) the point-prevalence of patients at nutritional risk. Patients with more than 30 days between surgery and nutritional risk screening were excluded. Associations were assessed using logistic regression, and the adjusted odds ratio included age (continuous), gender (male/female), type of surgery (acute/elective) and score from The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System. There was a significant higher incidence of SSI among patients at nutritional risk (11.8%), as compared to those who were not (7.0%) (p = 0.047). Moreover, the incidence of SSI was positively associated with the prevalence of nutritional risk in both simple (OR 1.76 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.98)) and adjusted (OR 1.81 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.16)) models. Answering “yes” to the screening questions regarding reduced dietary intake and weight loss was significantly associated with the incidence of SSI (respectively OR 2.66 (95% CI: 1.59, 4.45) and OR 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23, 3.76)). In conclusion, we demonstrate SSI to occur more often among patients at nutritional risk as compared to those who are not at nutritional risk. Future studies should investigate interventions to prevent both SSI and nutritional risk among surgical patients.</content></content><author><name>Eli Skeie</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Eli Skeie, Anne Mette Koch, Stig Harthug, Unni Fosse, Kari Sygnestveit, Roy Miodini Nilsen, Randi J.

benzyltriphenylphosphonium (BTP) thermometer ion is utilized to characterize
the fragmentation mechanisms of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) for femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. We demonstrate that the
survival yield of BTP approaches unity under these conditions, which suggests
that a minimal amount of fragmentation is occurring. It is also shown that the
survival yield of BTP is insensitive to the laser fluence. However, the
magnitude of fragmentation for the matrix increased notably for the same

This observation is in agreement with recent molecular dynamics simulations
which predict that it should be possible to separate both desorption and

indicate that angiotensin is the largest biomolecule which could be routinely
measured with these pulses. A mass upper-limit supports the hypothesis that
ionization is hindered by the increased thermal gradients imposed in the
lattice and associated velocity distribution within the ablation process from
the much higher lattice heating rate with femtosecond pulses. This effect
results in the temporal overlap between the neutral molecules and the matrix
ions being too small to result in sufficient proton exchange for ionization.</description><published>1528329600000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>The

lattice and associated velocity distribution within the ablation process from
the much higher lattice heating rate with femtosecond pulses. This effect
results in the temporal overlap between the neutral molecules and the matrix
ions being too small to result in sufficient proton exchange for ionization.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Femtosecond_Pumping_Rate_Dependence_of_Fragmentation_Mechanisms_in_Matrix-Assisted_Laser_Desorption_Ionization/6450380</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528386360884</crawled><id>R0sSyrOt3qz11n623gGB7cGypp5KEPrcBBGYnBmf/zQ=_163daed1634:65c41d3:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v2?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Dezfouli, A.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/18/285221</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/285221v2?rss=1</link><title>Models that learn how humans learn: the case of decision-making and its disorders [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>4b379d52</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Popular computational models of decision-making make specific assumptions about learning processes that may cause them to underfit observed behaviours.

Ferns are an important component of ecosystems around the world. Studies of the impacts that global changes may have on ferns are scarce, yet emerging studies indicate that some species may be particularly sensitive to climate change. The lack of research in this subject is much more aggravated in the case of epiphytes, and especially those that live under temperate climates. A mathematical model was developed for two temperate epiphytic ferns in order to predict potential impacts on spore germination kinetics, in response to different scenarios of global change, coming from increasing temperature and forest fragmentation. Our results show that an increasing temperature will have a negative impact over the populations of these temperate epiphytic ferns. Under unfragmented forests the germination percentage was comparatively less influenced than in fragmented patches. This study highlight that, in the long term, populations of the studied epiphytic temperate ferns may decline due to climate change. Overall, epiphytic fern communities will suffer changes in diversity, richness and dominance. Our study draws attention to the role of ferns in epiphytic communities of temperate forests, emphasizing the importance of considering these plants in any conservation strategy, specifically forest conservation.

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM. The corresponding DIM-PADM-based DAO problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm.The proposed algorithm was validated through application to TG119, prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) cases from the common optimization for radiation therapy dataset. Compared with the two-step FMO–LSA procedure, the proposed algorithm resulted in more precise dose conformality in all four cases.

In the traditional two-step procedure used in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, fluence map optimization (FMO) is performed first, followed by use of a leaf sequencing algorithm (LSA). By contrast, direct aperture optimization (DAO) directly optimizes aperture leaf positions and weights. However, dose calculation using the Monte Carlo (MC) method for DAO is often time-consuming. Therefore, a rapid DAO (RDAO) algorithm is proposed that uses a dose influence matrix based piecewise aperture dose model (DIM-PADM). In the proposed RDAO algorithm, dose calculation is based on the dose influence matrix instead of MC. The dose dependence of aperture leafs is modeled as a piecewise function using the DIM. The corresponding DIM-PADM-based DAO problem is solved using a simulated annealing algorithm.The proposed algorithm was validated through application to TG119, prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&amp;amp;N) cases from the common optimization for radiation therapy dataset. Compared with the two-step FMO–LSA procedure, the proposed algorithm resulted in more precise dose conformality in all four cases. Specifically, for the H&amp;amp;N dataset, the cost value for the planned target volume (PTV) was decreased by 32%, whereas the cost value for the two organs at risk (OARs) was decreased by 60% and 92%. Our study of the proposed novel DIM-PADM-based RDAO algorithm makes two main contributions: First, we validate the use of the proposed algorithm, in contrast to the FMO–LSA framework, for direct optimization of aperture leaf positions and show that this method results in more precise dose conformality.

The cost of specialized scientific equipment can be high and with limited funding resources, researchers and students are often unable to access or purchase the ideal equipment for their projects. In the fields of materials science and mechanical engineering, fundamental equipment such as tensile testing devices can cost tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While a research lab often has access to a large-scale testing machine suitable for conventional samples, loading devices for meso- and micro-scale samples for in-situ testing with the myriad of microscopy tools are often hard to source and cost prohibitive. Open-source software has allowed for great strides in the reduction of costs associated with software development and open-source hardware and additive manufacturing have the potential to similarly reduce the costs of scientific equipment and increase the accessibility of scientific research. To investigate the feasibility of open-source hardware, a micro-tensile tester was designed with a freely accessible computer-aided design package and manufactured with a desktop 3D-printer and off-the-shelf components. To our knowledge this is one of the first demonstrations of a tensile tester with additively manufactured components for scientific research. The capabilities of the tensile tester were demonstrated by investigating the mechanical properties of Graphene Oxide (GO) paper and thin films. A 3D printed tensile tester was successfully used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to provide one of the first quantitative measurements of GO thin film buckling under compression. The tensile tester was also used in conjunction with an atomic force microscope to observe the change in surface topology of a GO paper in response to increasing tensile strain. No significant change in surface topology was observed in contrast to prior hypotheses from the literature. Based on this result obtained with the new open source tensile stage we propose an alternative hypothesis we term ‘superlamellae consolidation’ to explain the initial deformation of GO paper. The additively manufactured tensile tester tested represents cost savings of &gt;99% compared to commercial solutions in its class and offers simple customization. However, continued development is needed for the tensile tester presented here to approach the technical specifications achievable with commercial solutions.</content></content><author><name>Krishanu Nandy</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Krishanu Nandy, David W.

Mortality information of populations is aggregated in life tables that serve as a basis for calculation of life expectancy and various life disparity measures. Conventional life-table methods address right-censoring inadequately by assuming a constant hazard in the last open-ended age group. As a result, life expectancy can be substantially distorted, especially in the case when the last age group in a life table contains a large proportion of the population. Previous research suggests addressing censoring in a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model setting as this framework incorporates all major features of adult mortality. In this article, we quantify the difference between gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy values and those published in the largest publicly available high-quality life-table databases for human populations, drawing attention to populations for which life expectancy values should be reconsidered. We also advocate the use of gamma-Gompertz-Makeham life expectancy for three reasons. First, model-based life-expectancy calculation successfully handles the problem of data quality or availability, resulting in severe censoring due to the unification of a substantial number of deaths in the last open-end age group. Second, model-based life expectancies are preferable in the case of data scarcity, i.e. when data contain numerous age groups with zero death counts: here, we provide an example of hunter-gatherer populations. Third, gamma-Gompertz-Makeham-based life expectancy values are almost identical to the ones provided by the major high-quality human mortality databases that use more complicated procedures. Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</content></content><author><name>László Németh</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by László Németh, Trifon I.

Applying a gamma-Gompertz-Makeham model to adult mortality data can be used to revise life-expectancy trends for historical populations that usually serve as input for mortality forecasts.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198485</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1528134132144</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163cbe461b0:4d7b790:3dd877af</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04589-8</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Maryline Beurg</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04589-8</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04589-8</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Variable number of TMC1-dependent mechanotransducer channels underlie tonotopic conductance gradients in the cochlea</title><fingerprint>68544531</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Variable number of TMC1-dependent mechanotransducer channels underlie tonotopic conductance gradients in the cochlea&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variable number of TMC1-dependent mechanotransducer channels underlie tonotopic conductance gradients in the cochlea, Published online: 05 June 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04589-8&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04589-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mechanoelectrical transduction channel (MET) current found in stereocilia of hair cells matures over the first postnatal week.

Objective &lt;p&gt;To determine whether vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is independently predictive of intra-amniotic infection and imminent spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD, delivery within 48 hours) in women with preterm labor with intact membranes (PTL) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).&lt;/p&gt; Method &lt;p&gt;This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. CVF samples for VDBP assays were obtained along with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels immediately after amniocentesis in consecutive women with PTL (n = 148) or PPROM (n = 103) between 23.0 and 34.0 weeks of gestation. VDBP levels in CVF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The primary outcome measures were intra-amniotic infection [defined as positive amniotic fluid (AF) culture] and SPTD within 48 hours after sampling.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;In the multivariable analysis, elevated VDBP levels in CVF samples of PTL women were significantly associated with intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery, even after adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., gestational age at sampling, parity, and serum CRP). However, these relationships were not found in women with PPROM. In women with PTL, the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves of CVF VDBP level for predicting intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery were 0.66 and 0.71, with cut-off values of 1.76 μg/mL (sensitivity of 64.3% and specificity of 78.4%) and 1.37 μg/mL (sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 72.6%), respectively. The CVF VDBP levels were significantly higher in women with PPROM than in those with PTL.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;VDBP in the CVF independently predicts intra-amniotic infection and imminent preterm delivery in women with PTL, whereas in women with PPROM, an elevated VDBP level in CVF is not associated with increased risks of these two outcome variables.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Song Yi Kook</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Song Yi Kook, Kyo Hoon Park, Ji Ae Jang, Yu Mi Kim, Hyunsoo Park, Se Jeong Jeon&lt;/p&gt;

The understanding of acclimation strategies to low temperature and water availability is decisive to ensure coffee crop sustainability, since these environmental conditions determine the suitability of cultivation areas. In this context, the impacts of single and combined exposure to drought and cold were evaluated in three genotypes of the two major cropped species, &lt;i&gt;Coffea arabica&lt;/i&gt; cv. Icatu, &lt;i&gt;Coffea canephora&lt;/i&gt; cv. Apoatã, and the hybrid Obatã. Crucial traits of plant resilience to environmental stresses have been examined: photosynthesis, lipoperoxidation and the antioxidant response. Drought and/or cold promoted leaf dehydration, which was accompanied by stomatal and mesophyll limitations that impaired leaf C-assimilation in all genotypes. However, Icatu showed a lower impact upon stress exposure and a faster and complete photosynthetic recovery. Although lipoperoxidation was increased by drought (Icatu) and cold (all genotypes), it was greatly reduced by stress interaction, especially in Icatu. In fact, although the antioxidative system was reinforced under single drought and cold exposure (e.g., activity of enzymes as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, APX, glutathione reductase and catalase, CAT), the stronger increases were observed upon the simultaneous exposure to both stresses, which was accompanied with a transcriptional response of some genes, namely related to APX. Complementary, non-enzyme antioxidant molecules were promoted mostly by cold and the stress interaction, including α-tocopherol (in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;arabica&lt;/i&gt; plants), ascorbate (ASC), zeaxanthin, and phenolic compounds (all genotypes). In general, drought promoted antioxidant enzymes activity, whereas cold enhanced the synthesis of both enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidants, the latter likely related to a higher need of antioxidative capability when enzyme reactions were probably quite repressed by low temperature. Icatu showed the wider antioxidative capability, with the triggering of all studied antioxidative molecules by drought (except CAT), cold, and, particularly, stress interaction (except ASC), revealing a clear stress cross-tolerance. This justified the lower impacts on membrane lipoperoxidation and photosynthetic capacity under stress interaction conditions, related to a better ROS control. These findings are also relevant to coffee water management, showing that watering in the cold season should be largely avoided.</content></content><author><name>José C.

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of active weight loss attempts in Sweden, and to study the extent to which overweight individuals may or may not correctly identify themselves as overweight. Additional aims were to determine the sociodemographic factors associated with following a specific dietary regimen and with attempts at losing weight. A postal questionnaire was sent to 2000 randomly selected men and women living in Sweden. The inclusion criteria was an age of 20–65 years. In total, the response rate was 28% and the completed questionnaires from 555 participants were analyzed in this study. In total, 46% of participants were overweight or obese by self-reported height and weight. Additionally, 42% of overweight and 90% of obese individuals correctly identified themselves as being overweight. Weight loss was pursued by 41% and was more common among women, those with higher physical activity, higher BMI and higher socioeconomic position. Overall, 22% followed a specific diet, and following a dietary regimen was associated with female gender, higher education level and overweight. In conclusion, almost half of the participants were either overweight or trying to lose weight. Trying to lose weight and following a specific dietary regimen were related to female gender, high BMI and higher socioeconomic position. This could indicate that the socioeconomic disparities in health are further exacerbated, as overweight individuals with poor socioeconomic position might be more likely to remain overweight.</content></content><author><name>Linnea Bärebring</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Linnea Bärebring, Anna Winkvist, Hanna Augustin&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Syphilis in pregnancy is an under-recognized public health problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa which accounts for over 60% of the global burden of syphilis. If left untreated, more than half of maternal syphilis cases will result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including stillbirth and fetal loss, neonatal death, prematurity or low birth weight, and neonatal infections. Achieving universal coverage of antenatal syphilis screening and treatment has been the focus of the global campaign for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis. However, little is known about the availability of antenatal syphilis screening and treatment across sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this study was to estimate the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’ for antenatal syphilis screening and treatment by analyzing health facility surveys and household surveys conducted from 2010 to 2015 in 12 sub-Saharan African countries.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;In this secondary data analysis, we linked indicators of health facility readiness to provide antenatal syphilis detection and treatment from Service Provision Assessments (SPAs) and Service Availability and Readiness Assessments (SARAs) to indicators of ANC use from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) to compute estimates of the ‘likelihood of appropriate care’.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Based on data from 5,593 health facilities that reported offering antenatal care (ANC) services, the availability of syphilis detection and treatment in ANC facilities ranged from 2% to 83%. The availability of syphilis detection and treatment was substantially lower in ANC facilities in West Africa compared to the other sub-regions. Levels of ANC attendance were high (median 94.9%), but only 27% of ANC attendees initiated care at less than 4 months gestation. We estimated that about one in twelve pregnant women received ANC early (&amp;lt;4 months) at a facility ready to provide syphilis detection and treatment (median 8%, range 7–32%). The largest implementation bottleneck identified was low health facility readiness, followed by timeliness of the first ANC visit.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;While access was fairly high, the low levels of likelihood of antenatal syphilis detection and treatment identified reinforce the need to improve the availability of syphilis rapid diagnostic tests and treatment and the timeliness of antenatal care-seeking across sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mufaro Kanyangarara</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mufaro Kanyangarara, Neff Walker, Ties Boerma&lt;/p&gt;

That’s how it is in drug research, and how it is in science in general. The problems and questions we’re working on are bigger than any one nationality; we’re tackling these things as a species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s disquieting to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/584?rss=1&quot;&gt;this sort of thing&lt;/a&gt;. That article reports that the (quite nationalist) government in Hungary is causing trouble for universities there, specifically the Central European University, accusing it and some of its faculty members of being in the pay of opponents of the government. It’s especially sad to see the national science funding agency participate in such actions. Hungarian scientists were a profound influence on the 20th century; the country produced a run of mathematicians, physicists, biologists, and chemists that had colleagues at Los Alamos joking that they must be Martians in disguise. But they didn’t get to that point by trying to do only Pure Hungarian Research, because there’s no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No more than there is Pure American, Pure German, or Pure Chinese Research.A look at what Germany did to its own scientific establishment under the National Socialist government should be all that’s needed as an argument, but apparently not. These things are dangerous fantasies, because talent comes from everywhere (and it often doesn’t conform to any given government’s ideology, either). I have a strong feeling that the current Hungarian government would be denouncing John von Neumann as a secret agent of George Soros were he or his like alive today. And they’re doing their best to make sure that the country never produces another such figure, which is a loss for the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/china-to-roll-back-regulations-for-traditional-medicine-despite-safety-concerns-1.23038&quot;&gt;Here’s another example&lt;/a&gt; of nationalism at work, this time in drug research. The Chinese government is apparently planning to drop requirements for safety and efficacy testing of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapies. Xi Jinping himself is a big advocate, and what more do you need? Students who want to become TCM practitioners no longer need to pass the national medical exam to open their practices. Not only are these preparations getting easy regulatory treatment – the government is making it harder and harder for anyone to express any contrary opinions about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With strong government support for the alternative medicines industry, Chinese censors have been quick to remove posts from the Internet that question its efficacy. On 23 October, an article on a medical news site that called for closer attention to the risks of aristolochic acid was removed from social media site WeChat. The story had been viewed more than 700,000 times in three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Debate over TCMs has been silenced before in China. Last year, a Beijing think tank — the Development Research Center of the State Council — proposed banning the practice of extracting Asiatic black bear bile, another common ingredient in TCMs. The think tank’s report questioned the remedy’s efficacy and suggested using synthetic alternatives. It was removed from the think tank’s website after the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which supports the development of TCM, called it biased and demanded an apology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04886-8&quot;&gt;go to jail&lt;/a&gt; for criticizing this stuff. Now, I think the way that the US regulates (or doesn’t regulate) “dietary supplements” &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/11/04/the_herbal_supplement_industry_is_not_a_very_funny_joke&quot;&gt;is a disgrace&lt;/a&gt;, but this is insanely worse. China has a great many excellent scientists, in a great many fields, and in drug research in particular they’re working on joining the short list of countries who have their own research-based drug industry that can produce new therapies to help patients around the world. But this effort will not be aided by making it easier for the black bear bile industry. I leave aside for another time discussion of how some of these “remedies” are driving animals around the world to extinction, but that’s just another argument for actually seeing if any of these things work (or even cause actual harm instead), and &lt;em&gt;taking them off the market&lt;/em&gt; if they don’t. But the Chinese government has made the cynical calculation that promoting this stuff will pay off politically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what? There’s a connection between these two examples. Guess what the Hungarian government is interested in promoting? Traditional Chinese medicine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Government spokespeople declined to answer specific questions about CEU, but did address another flash point: the country’s growing embrace of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). On 16 April, Hungary’s University of Szeged signed an agreement with the Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine in Xianyang, China, to bring TCM researchers, medical experts, and lecturers to teach in the region. The University of Pécs in Hungary has had a similar arrangement since 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last year, the Hungarian government also announced plans to allocate about €4.5 million ($5.3 million) to build a new institute with a whole floor dedicated to TCM at Semmelweis University, one of the most prestigious medical schools in Hungary. The government says it wants to bridge the gap between Western medicine and Eastern alternatives to improve Hungarian health care, and also strengthen the economic, political, and cultural ties between Hungary and China.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would guess that the most important word in that last sentence is “economic”. It’s pretty strange to see the Hungarian government deciding that the honor of Hungary has to be protected by embracing Chinese herbal remedies, but I’m sure that there are plenty of idiotic speeches laying this connection out in soul-eroding detail. No, this sort of thing is bad news. The reason science works is that we ask questions, investigate them to the best of our abilities, and build on the results that we get &lt;em&gt;whether we like them or not&lt;/em&gt;. Wishful thinking doesn’t work so well. The physical world does what it does independent of anyone’s political agenda or nationalist sloganeering, and pretending otherwise is shameful and stupid.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><published>1526042727000</published><summary><direction>ltr</direction><content>I would guess that, at this point, I’ve worked with people from every region of the planet except Greenland and Antarctica.

Choosing valuable objects and rewarding actions is critical for survival. While such choices must be made in a way that suits the animal’s circumstances, the neural mechanisms underlying such context-appropriate behavior are unclear. To address this question, we devised a context-dependent reward-seeking task for macaque monkeys. Each trial started with the appearance of one of many visual scenes containing two or more objects, and the monkey had to choose the good object by saccade to get a reward. These scenes were categorized into two dimensions of emotional context: dangerous versus safe and rich versus poor. We found that many amygdala neurons were more strongly activated by dangerous scenes, by rich scenes, or by both. Furthermore, saccades to target objects occurred more quickly in dangerous than in safe scenes and were also quicker in rich than in poor scenes. Thus, amygdala neuronal activity and saccadic reaction times were negatively correlated in each monkey. These results suggest that amygdala neurons facilitate targeting saccades predictably based on aspects of emotional context, as is necessary for goal-directed and social behavior.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/UixC9bfw7t8&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</description><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Kazutaka Maeda, Jun Kunimatsu, Okihide Hikosaka&lt;/p&gt;

This result highlights the importance of considering gene set overlap in gene set analysis and establishes the direction for developing new gene set analysis methods.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/319145v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525961906332</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_1634a6ad89c:13fcebe:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/866-a?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527183688000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6391/866.1.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/866-a?rss=1</link><title>The road to wild yak protection in China</title><fingerprint>558280c</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163935d6875:7dce957:3dd877af</id><author><name>Chen, M., Sun, Y., Yang, C., Zeng, G., Li, Z., Zhang, J.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6391/866-a?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527185762421</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168419v2?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Karimzadeh, M.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/11/168419</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/168419v2?rss=1</link><title>Virtual ChIP-seq: Predicting transcription factor binding by learning from the transcriptome [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>211a1ba4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>MOTIVATION: Identifying transcription factor binding sites is the first step in pinpointing non-coding mutations that disrupt the regulatory function of transcription factors and promote disease.

Despite their demonstrated biocompatibility and osteogenic properties, oyster shells have been reported as a potential alternative to other commonly used materials for bone substitution. This study evaluated whether an experimental bone substitute (EBS) made from a typical oyster shell of Northeastern Brazil (&lt;i&gt;Crassostrea rhizophora&lt;/i&gt;) has effects on bone development using an animal model. Oysters were collected from a biologically assisted vivarium, and their inner layer was used for preparing an EBS. Chemical and surface characterization of EBS was performed using Individually Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), respectively. Seventy-two rats were randomly assigned to groups according to the treatment of bone defects created in the submandibular area: Negative Control (-C), Positive Control (+C; Bio-Oss&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) and EBS. Euthanasia occurred at 7, 21, 42 and 56 days postoperatively. The bone pieces were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E). The formation of bone tissue was evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. Data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test and ANOVA considering a significant level of 5%. The main element found in EBS was calcium (71.68%), and it presented heterogeneity in the particle size and a porosity aspect at SEM analysis. Histological results revealed the absence of inflammatory cells in all groups, being that EBS presented the most accelerated process of bone formation with a statistically significant difference between this group and the +C and -C groups in the 21-day time-point (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). After 21 days, the bone formation process was similar between all groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05), showing an immature lamellar bone pattern after 56 days of experimentation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05).

The resolution is strongly dependent on insect taxon: COI primers detect 40% of Hymenoptera, while 12S primers detect 12% of Collembola. Our results indicate that amplicon-based metabarcoding of insect samples can be improved by choosing other primers than those commonly used today.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/325688v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526651957125</crawled><id>etqytnxFjd3GAn8xMJJp7LqVqHOESySVtRTYAVCTxTI=_163738c2f85:527ab9d:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34463</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527724800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34463</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.34463</link><title>Predicting the likelihood and intensity of mosquito infection from sex specific Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte density</title><fingerprint>5f7419c1</fingerprint><description>Understanding the importance of gametocyte density on human-to-mosquito transmission is of immediate relevance to malaria control.

Despite the advent of highly active anti-retroviral therapy HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be a significant problem. Furthermore, the precise pathogenesis of this neurodegeneration is still unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between infection by the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and neuronal injury in the rhesus macaque using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; sampling techniques. The effect of SIV infection in 23 adult rhesus macaques was investigated using an accelerated NeuroAIDS model. Disease progression was modulated either with combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART, 4 animals) or minocycline (7 animals). Twelve animals remained untreated. Viral loads were monitored in the blood and cerebral spinal fluid, as were levels of activated monocytes in the blood. Neuronal injury was monitored &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Viral RNA was quantified in brain tissue of each animal &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and neuronal injury was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Without treatment, viral RNA in plasma, cerebral spinal fluid, and brain tissue appears to reach a plateau. Neuronal injury was highly correlated both to plasma viral levels and a subset of infected/activated monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which are known to traffic the virus into the brain. Treatment with either cART or minocycline decreased brain viral levels and partially reversed alterations in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and immunohistochemical markers for neuronal injury. These findings suggest there is significant turnover of replicating virus within the brain and the severity of neuronal injury is directly related to the brain viral load.</content></content><author><name>R.

[NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>c6515471</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Background: Genome-scale metabolic models allow researchers to calculate yields, to predict consumption and production rates, and to study the effect of genetic modifications in silico, without running resource-intensive experiments. While these models have become an invaluable tool for optimizing industrial production hosts like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, few such models exist for one-carbon (C1) metabolizers. Results: Here we present a genome-scale metabolic model for Methylococcus capsulatus, a well-studied obligate methanotroph, which has been used as a production strain of single cell protein (SCP). The model was manually curated, and spans a total of 877 metabolites connected via 898 reactions.

While these models have become an invaluable tool for optimizing industrial production hosts like E. coli and S. cerevisiae, few such models exist for one-carbon (C1) metabolizers. Results: Here we present a genome-scale metabolic model for Methylococcus capsulatus, a well-studied obligate methanotroph, which has been used as a production strain of single cell protein (SCP). The model was manually curated, and spans a total of 877 metabolites connected via 898 reactions. The inclusion of 730 genes and comprehensive annotations, make this model not only a useful tool for modeling metabolic physiology, but also a centralized knowledge base for M. capsulatus. With it, we determined that oxidation of methane by the particulate methane monooxygenase is most likely driven through uphill electron transfer operating at reduced efficiency as this scenario matches best with experimental data from literature. Conclusions: The metabolic model will serve the ongoing fundamental research of C1 metabolism, and pave the way for rational strain design strategies towards improved SCP production processes in M. capsulatus.</description><alternate><item><href>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/329714v1?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527182547109</crawled><id>WhxiSuo5O9syU+S1SzBXW5+S/FvRJt15MiaI6u55YXs=_163932c58a5:7fe83e1:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04310-9</originId><origin><title>Nature Communications - current - nature.com science feeds</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current</streamId></origin><author><name>Rizi Ai</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><engagement>61</engagement><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04310-9</link><canonical><item><href>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04310-9</href><type>text/html</type></item></canonical><title>Comprehensive epigenetic landscape of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes</title><fingerprint>523f30a4</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comprehensive epigenetic landscape of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive epigenetic landscape of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes, Published online: 15 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04310-9&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41467-018-04310-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in the intimal layer of the synovium can become invasive and destroy cartilage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Urbanization has been driven by various social, economic, and political factors around the world for centuries. Because urbanization continues unabated in many places, it is crucial to understand patterns of urbanization and their potential ecological and environmental impacts. Given this need, the objectives of our study were to quantify urban growth rates, growth modes, and resultant changes in the landscape pattern of urbanization in Hanoi, Vietnam from 1993 to 2010 and to evaluate the extent to which the process of urban growth in Hanoi conformed to the diffusion-coalescence theory. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of the built-up land in Hanoi using landscape expansion modes, spatial metrics, and a gradient approach. Urbanization was most pronounced in the periods of 2001–2006 and 2006–2010 at a distance of 10 to 35 km around the urban center. Over the 17 year period urban expansion in Hanoi was dominated by infilling and edge expansion growth modes. Our findings support the diffusion-coalescence theory of urbanization. The shift of the urban growth areas over time and the dynamic nature of the spatial metrics revealed important information about our understanding of the urban growth process and cycle. Furthermore, our findings can be used to evaluate urban planning policies and aid in urbanization issues in rapidly urbanizing countries.</content></content><author><name>Duong H.

Retina is a paradigmatic system for studying sensory encoding: the transformation of light into spiking activity of ganglion cells. The inverse problem, where stimulus is reconstructed from spikes, has received less attention, especially for complex stimuli that should be reconstructed “pixel-by-pixel”. We recorded around a hundred neurons from a dense patch in a rat retina and decoded movies of multiple small randomly-moving discs. We constructed nonlinear (kernelized and neural network) decoders that improved significantly over linear results. An important contribution to this was the ability of nonlinear decoders to reliably separate between neural responses driven by locally fluctuating light signals, and responses at locally constant light driven by spontaneous-like activity. This improvement crucially depended on the precise, non-Poisson temporal structure of individual spike trains, which originated in the spike-history dependence of neural responses. We propose a general principle by which downstream circuitry could discriminate between spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity based solely on higher-order statistical structure in the incoming spike trains.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0tROk9h9FSA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1525984928890</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Vicente Botella-Soler, Stéphane Deny, Georg Martius, Olivier Marre, Gašper Tkačik&lt;/p&gt;

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors.

Infection experiments are critical for understanding wildlife disease dynamics. Although infection experiments are typically designed to reduce complexity, disease outcomes still result from complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Cryptic variation across factors can lead to decreased repeatability of infection experiments within and between research groups and hinder research progress. Furthermore, studies with unexpected results are often relegated to the “file drawer” and potential insights gained from these experimental outcomes are lost. Here, we report unexpected results from an infection experiment studying the response of two differentially-susceptible but related frogs (American Bullfrog &lt;i&gt;Rana catesbeiana&lt;/i&gt; and the Mountain yellow-legged frog &lt;i&gt;Rana muscosa&lt;/i&gt;) to the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus (&lt;i&gt;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&lt;/i&gt;, Bd).

4′-cyano-2′-deoxyinosine (SK14-061a), a novel nucleoside analog based on inosine, has antiviral activity against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 that has the ability to acquire resistance against many types of reverse transcriptase inhibitors based on nucleosides. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics studies after its oral administration to rats. For this purpose, we first developed and validated an analytical method for quantitatively determining SK14-061a levels in biological samples by a UPLC system interfaced with a TOF-MS system. A rapid, simple and selective method for the quantification of SK14-061a in biological samples was established using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with solid phase extraction. The pharmacokinetic properties of SK14-061a in rats after oral administration were then evaluated using this LC-MS method. SK14-061a was found to be relatively highly bioavailable, is rapidly absorbed from the intestinal tract, and is then mainly distributed to the liver and then ultimately excreted via the urine in an unchanged form. Furthermore, the simultaneous administration of SK14-061a with the nucleoside analog, entecavir, led to a significant alteration in the pharmacokinetics of SK14-061a. These results suggest that the SK14-061a has favorable pharmacokinetic properties with a high bioavailability with the potential for use in oral pharmaceutical formulations, but drug-drug interactions should also be considered.</content></content><author><name>Mai Hashimoto</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Hashimoto, Kazuaki Taguchi, Takako Ishiguro, Satoru Kohgo, Shuhei Imoto, Keishi Yamasaki, Hiroaki Mitsuya, Masaki Otagiri&lt;/p&gt;

This study aims to find out the relationship between pet keeping in childhood and asthma and allergy among children aged 0–8 years old in Tianjin, China. Parental or guardians reports of 7360 children were analyzed. 1490 (21.6%) families kept pets at the time of the survey (current), among them 4.0% cats, and 14.7% dogs. For the first year of life of children (early), 1196 (18.4%) families kept pets, and among them 3.2% cats, and 13.7% dogs. Exposure to a pet in early childhood significantly increased the risk of current wheeze, current dry cough, and diagnosed rhinitis. 17.9% of parents reported an avoidance behavior, i.e., had removed or refrained a pet due to asthma or allergy in the family. After adjustment for avoidance behavior, the negative effect of pet keeping on children’s health became even more obvious, with e.g. an AOR of 3.37 (1.58–7.19) for diagnosed asthma, 3.60 (2.07–6.27) for diagnosed rhinitis, 1.92 (1.31–2.81) for diagnosed eczema. A dose-response relationship between pet keeping at current and current wheeze, current eczema and diagnosed eczema was found. In conclusion, pet exposure in early life of children in Tianjin is a risk factor for asthma and allergies among children aged 0–8 years old.</content></content><author><name>Shugang Luo</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Shugang Luo, Yuexia Sun, Jing Hou, Xiangrui Kong, Pan Wang, Qingnan Zhang, Jan Sundell&lt;/p&gt;

Due to the importance of RNA-binding proteins in gene regulation, a great number of studies have been conducted, resulting in a large amount of RNA-Seq datasets. However, these datasets usually do not have structured organization of metadata, which limits their potentially wide use. To bridge this gap, the metadata of a comprehensive set of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq datasets with perturbed RNA-binding proteins were collected and integrated into a database called RBPMetaDB. This database contains 278 mouse RNA-Seq datasets for a comprehensive list of 163 RNA-binding proteins. These RNA-binding proteins account for only ~10% of all known RNA-binding proteins annotated in Gene Ontology, indicating that most are still unexplored using high-throughput sequencing. This negative information provides a great pool of candidate RNA-binding proteins for biologists to conduct future experimental studies. In addition, we found that DNA-binding activities are significantly enriched among RNA-binding proteins in RBPMetaDB, suggesting that prior studies of these DNA- and RNA-binding factors focus more on DNA-binding activities instead of RNA-binding activities. This result reveals the opportunity to efficiently reuse these data for investigation of the roles of their RNA-binding activities. A web application has also been implemented to enable easy access and wide use of RBPMetaDB.

We also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory success generalizes (or doesn’t) across contexts and domains.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/31185</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Neuroscience</item></keywords><crawled>1527610674077</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163acb10b9d:2050cd2:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37325</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527724800000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37325</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.37325</link><title>Mediodorsal thalamus is required for discrete phases of goal-directed behavior in macaques</title><fingerprint>9d515761</fingerprint><description>Reward contingencies are dynamic: outcomes that were valued at one point may subsequently lose value.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth–modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth–promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/β-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non–immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical β-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ‘ligand-limited’ therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0-d2BFNTwPU&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><published>1525813200000</published><description>&lt;p&gt;by Nathan J.

Identification of cancer driver mutations is critical for advancing cancer research and personalized medicine. Due to inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity, many driver mutations occur at low frequencies, which make it challenging to distinguish them from passenger mutations. Here, we show that a novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach, named rDriver can achieve enhanced prediction accuracy by identifying mutations that not only have high functional impact scores but also are associated with systemic variation in gene expression levels. In examining 3,080 tumor samples from 8 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, rDriver predicted 1,389 driver mutations. Compared with existing tools, rDriver identified more low frequency mutations associated with lineage specific functional properties, timing of occurrence and patient survival. Evaluation of rDriver predictions using engineered cell-line models resulted in a positive predictive value of 0.94 in &lt;i&gt;PIK3CA&lt;/i&gt; genes. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multi-omic data in predicting cancer driver mutations and provides a statistically rigorous solution for cancer target discovery and development.</content></content><author><name>Zixing Wang</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Zixing Wang, Kwok-Shing Ng, Tenghui Chen, Tae-Beom Kim, Fang Wang, Kenna Shaw, Kenneth L.

Crop resistance is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly strategy for pest management. The brown planthopper (BPH, &lt;i&gt;Nilaparvata lugens&lt;/i&gt;) is a devastating rice insect pest due to its ability to rapidly overcome plant resistance and the lack of sufficient resistance resources. BR4831 (a rice breeding line derived from the pyramiding of two BPH resistance genes, &lt;i&gt;Bph14&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bph15&lt;/i&gt;, into the elite rice variety Huang-Hua-Zhan, HHZ) and two single-gene introgression lines (HF106, carrying &lt;i&gt;Bph14&lt;/i&gt;, and C602, carrying &lt;i&gt;Bph15&lt;/i&gt;, in the elite rice cultivar 9311) were evaluated for their resistance to BPH using a standard seed box screening test coupled with field tests. The related resistance types were determined using laboratory assays. The seed box test and laboratory biological assays showed that BR4831 exhibited strong antibiotic resistance, and the behavioral assay showed that this line also exhibited strong antixenotic resistance, while both HF106 and C602 exhibited only weak antibiosis and no antixenotic resistance. Field tests showed significantly improved resistance in BR4831 compared to that of its recipient parent HHZ and slightly increased resistance in HF106 and C602 in comparison with their recipient parent 9311.

Yu&lt;/p&gt;
Background &lt;p&gt;Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic drug, has activity in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Potential mechanisms of action include degrading constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) or inhibiting other drug-resistance pathways (e.g., Wnt-signaling). Published pharmacokinetics data suggests that niclosamide has poor oral bioavailability, potentially limiting its use as a cancer drug. Therefore, we launched a Phase I study testing oral niclosamide in combination with enzalutamide, for longer and at higher doses than those used to treat helminthic infections.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We conducted a Phase I dose-escalation study testing oral niclosamide plus standard-dose enzalutamide in men with metastatic CRPC previously treated with abiraterone. Niclosamide was given three-times-daily (TID) at the following dose-levels: 500, 1000 or 1500mg. The primary objective was to assess safety. Secondary objectives, included measuring AR-V expression from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the AdnaTest assay, evaluating PSA changes and determining niclosamide’s pharmacokinetic profile.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;20 patients screened and 5 enrolled after passing all screening procedures. 13(65%) patients had detectable CTCs, but only one was AR-V+. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in 3 patients on the 500mg TID cohort; however, both (N = 2) subjects on the 1000mg TID cohort experienced DLTs (prolonged grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; and colitis). The maximum plasma concentration ranged from 35.7–82 ng/mL and was not consistently above the minimum effective concentration in preclinical studies. There were no PSA declines in any enrolled subject. Because plasma concentrations at the maximum tolerated dose (500mg TID) were not consistently above the expected therapeutic threshold, the Data Safety Monitoring Board closed the study for futility.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;Oral niclosamide could not be escalated above 500mg TID, and plasma concentrations were not consistently above the threshold shown to inhibit growth in CRPC models. Oral niclosamide is not a viable compound for repurposing as a CRPC treatment.&lt;/p&gt; Clinical trial registry &lt;p&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02532114&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Michael T.

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis niger&lt;/i&gt; desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.&lt;img width=&quot;1&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</content></content><recrawled>1528317724227</recrawled><description>&lt;p&gt;by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman&lt;/p&gt;

To study sodium homeostasis, we performed a genome-wide screen for deletion strains that show resistance to NaCl. We identified 34 NaCl-resistant strains. Among them, the largest group that consists of 10 genes related to membrane trafficking and 7 out of 10 genes are ESCRT proteins which are involved in cargo transportation into luminal vesicles within the multivesicular body. All of the ESCRT related mutants which showed sodium resistance also showed defects in vacuole fusion. To further understand the role of the ESCRT pathway in various ion homeostasis, we examined sensitivity of these ESCRT mutants to various cation salts other than NaCl, including KCl, LiCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NiSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a retinal degenerative disorder caused by mutations in &lt;i&gt;RS1&lt;/i&gt; gene leading to splitting of retinal layers (schisis) which impairs visual signal processing. Retinoschisin (RS1) is an adhesive protein which is secreted predominantly by the photoreceptors and bipolar cells as a double-octameric complex. In general, XLRS patients show wide clinical heterogeneity, presenting practical challenges in disease management. Though researchers have attempted various approaches to offer an explanation for clinical heterogeneity, the molecular basis has not been understood yet. Therefore, this study aims at establishing a link between the phenotype and genotype based on the molecular mechanism exerted by the mutations. Twenty seven XLRS patients were enrolled, of which seven harboured novel mutations. The mutant constructs were genetically engineered and their secretion profiles were studied by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell culture experiments. Based on the secretory profile, the patients were categorized as either secreted or non-secreted group. Various clinical parameters such as visual acuity, location of schisis, foveal thickness and ERG parameters were compared between the two groups and control. Although the two groups showed severe disease phenotype in comparison with control, there was no significant difference between the two XLRS groups. However, the secreted group exhibited relatively severe disease indications. On the other hand molecular analysis suggests that most of the &lt;i&gt;RS1&lt;/i&gt; mutations result in intracellular retention of retinoschisin. Hence, clinical parameters of patients with non-secreted profile were analyzed which in turn revealed wide variability even within the group. Altogether, our results indicate that disease severity is not merely dependent on secretory profile of the mutations. Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients.</content></content><author><name>Dhandayuthapani Sudha</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Dhandayuthapani Sudha, Srividya Neriyanuri, Ramya Sachidanandam, Srikrupa N.

Thus, we hypothesize that intricate molecular detail such as the precise localization of mutant protein in the cell as well as its ability to assemble into a functionally active oligomer might largely influence disease severity among XLRS patients.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198086</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1527788526662</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_163b74adc46:323b93e:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/340646v1?rss=1</originId><origin><title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Bioinformatics</title><htmlUrl>http://biorxiv.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://hwmaint.biorxiv.highwire.org/cgi/collection/rss?coll_alias=bioinformatics</streamId></origin><author><name>Bizzego, A.</name></author><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/06/340646</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/340646v1?rss=1</link><title>Evaluating reproducibility of AI algorithms in digital pathology with DAPPER [NEW RESULTS]</title><fingerprint>26543900</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>Artificial Intelligence is exponentially increasing its impact on healthcare. As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, e.g. from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.

We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test 3 different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with 4 datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total 53 000 tiles at 512 x 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for random features and random labels diagnostic tests to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility.

The aim of this study was to examine eye movements and postural control performance among dyslexic children while reading a text and performing the Landolt reading task. Fifteen dyslexic and 15 non-dyslexic children were asked to stand upright while performing two experimental visual tasks: text reading and Landolt reading. In the text reading task, children were asked to silently read a text displayed on a monitor, while in the Landolt reading task, the letters in the text were replaced by closed circles and Landolt rings, and children were asked to scan each circle/ring in a reading-like fashion, from left to right, and to count the number of Landolt rings. Eye movements (Mobile T2&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, SuriCog) and center of pressure excursions (Framiral&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Grasse, France) were recorded. Visual performance variables were total reading time, mean duration of fixation, number of pro- and retro-saccades, and amplitude of pro-saccades. Postural performance variable was the center of pressure area. The results showed that dyslexic children spent more time reading the text and had a longer duration of fixation than non-dyslexic children. However, no difference was observed between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children in the Landolt reading task. Dyslexic children performed a higher number of pro- and retro-saccades than non-dyslexic children in both text reading and Landolt reading tasks. Dyslexic children had smaller pro-saccade amplitude than non-dyslexic children in the text reading task. Finally, postural performance was poorer in dyslexic children than in non-dyslexic children. Reading difficulties in dyslexic children are related to eye movement strategies required to scan and obtain lexical and semantic meaning. However, postural control performance, which was poor in dyslexic children, is not related to lexical and semantic reading requirements and might not also be related to different eye movement behavior.</content></content><author><name>Milena Razuk</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Milena Razuk, José Angelo Barela, Hugo Peyre, Christophe Loic Gerard, Maria Pia Bucci&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. produce a broad spectrum of lipopeptide biosurfactants, among which surfactin, iturin and fengycin are widely studied families. The goals of this study were to characterize the biosurfactant activity of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. and to investigate their motility and biofilm formation capabilities.

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. produce a broad spectrum of lipopeptide biosurfactants, among which surfactin, iturin and fengycin are widely studied families. The goals of this study were to characterize the biosurfactant activity of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. and to investigate their motility and biofilm formation capabilities. In addition, we extracted lipopeptides from these bacteria to assess their antifungal activities and analyzed these products by mass spectrometry (MS). &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;amyloliquefaciens&lt;/i&gt; FZB42, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; sp. NH 217 and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; NH-100 exhibited excellent biosurfactant and surface spreading activities, whereas &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;atrophaeus&lt;/i&gt; 176s and &lt;i&gt;Paenibacillus polymyxa&lt;/i&gt; C1225 showed moderate activity, and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; 168 showed no activity.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the association between preoperational factors and patients’ short-term outcome after proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) and to provide a basis for detailed surgical indication and patient selection.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing PFO between January 2015 and December 2015. Preoperational clinical data including gender, age, duration of disease, visual analogue score (VAS) and American Knee Society (KSS) score were collected. The radiological factors including hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA angle), condyle-plateau angle (CP angle), Kellgren and Lawrence grade (KL grade), joint space width of both compartments and settlement value were also considered. Patients were followed for at 12 months postoperatively. Both clinical and functional KSS scores were obtained. The outcome of interest was divided into clinical outcome and functional outcome. For each, two criteria were defined: satisfaction and significant improvement. Satisfaction is characterized by a KSS clinical or functional score over 70 points (excellent and good results); significant improvement refers to an increase in KSS scores of more than 15 points. Bivariate logistic regression for the association between preoperational factors and outcomes of interest was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to detect the independent factors affecting the outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;A total of 84 patients and 111 knees were followed-up. Of these, 17 knees were from males and 94 were from females. The average age was 59.45±8.82 years. The average preoperational VAS score, KSS clinical and functional score were 7.08±1.41 points, 49.14±10.95 points and 44.97±17.71 points, respectively. According to KL grading, there were 17 knees of grade 2, 47 knees of grade 3, and 47 knees of grade 4. In clinical outcomes, there were 51 knees in the satisfaction group and 77 knees in the significant improvement group. In functional outcomes, 43 knees were in the satisfaction group and 76 knees in the significant improvement group. KSS clinical score (OR = 1.134, 95%CI = 1.067–1.205, P = 0.000) was the independent factor associated with clinical satisfaction. Age (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.000–1.150, P = 0.048), VAS score (OR = 1.679, 95%CI = 1.041–2.706, P = 0.033), KSS clinical (OR = 1.072, 95%CI = 1.005–1.144, P = 0.034) and functional (OR = 1.100, 95%CI = 1.044–1.159, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.345, 95%CI = 1.119–1.617, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 7.540, 95%CI = 1.307–43.484, P = 0.024) were the independent factors associated with functional satisfaction. KSS clinical (OR = 0.905, 95%CI = 0.850–0.963, P = 0.002) score, CP angle (OR = 0.760, 95%CI = 0.593–0.973, P = 0.030) and medial joint space width (OR = 0.001, 95%CI = 0.000–0.107, P = 0.003) were the independent factors associated with significant clinical improvement; VAS score (OR = 1.582, 95%CI = 1.042–2.402, P = 0.031), KSS functional (OR = 0.888, 95%CI = 0.838–0.942, P = 0.000) score, HKA angle (OR = 1.292, 95%CI = 1.101–1.518, P = 0.002) and settlement value (OR = 9.990, 95%CI = 1.485–67.197, P = 0.018) were the independent factors associated with significant functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusions &lt;p&gt;The independent factors affecting postoperative clinical outcome after PFO were KSS clinical score, CP angle and medial joint space width. In addition, the independent factors that influenced functional outcome included age, VAS score, KSS score, HKA angle and settlement value. As objective radiological evidence, HKA angle and settlement value could be used as an important basis for patient selection for PFO.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Bo Liu</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Bo Liu, Wei Chen, Qi Zhang, Xiaoli Yan, Fei Zhang, Tianhua Dong, Guang Yang, Yingze Zhang&lt;/p&gt;

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions.

Hand hygiene practice in hospitals is unfortunately still widely insufficient, even though it is known that transmitting pathogens via hands is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections. Previous research has shown that improving knowledge, providing feedback on past behaviour and targeting social norms are promising approaches to improve hand hygiene practices. The present field experiment was designed to direct people on when to perform hand hygiene and prevent forgetfulness. This intervention is the first to examine the effect of inducing injunctive social norms via an emoticon-based feedback system on hand hygiene behaviour. Electronic monitoring and feedback devices were installed in hospital patient rooms on top of hand-rub dispensers, next to the doorway, for a period of 17 weeks. In the emoticon condition, screens at the devices activated whenever a person entered or exited the room. Before using the alcohol-based hand-rub dispenser, a frowny face was displayed, indicating that hand hygiene should be performed. If the dispenser was subsequently used, this picture changed to a smiley face to positively reinforce the correct behaviour. Hand hygiene behaviour in the emoticon rooms significantly outperformed the behaviour in three other tested conditions. The strong effect in this field experiment indicates that activating injunctive norms may be a promising approach to improve hand hygiene behaviour. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0197465</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1526924522884</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16383cb3584:6761228:93d646dc</id></item><item><originId>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32833</originId><origin><title>eLife: latest articles</title><htmlUrl>https://elifesciences.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://elife.elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml</streamId></origin><published>1526342400000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>https://elifesciences.org/articles/32833</canonicalUrl><engagement>182</engagement><link>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32833</link><title>Distinct myocardial lineages break atrial symmetry during cardiogenesis in zebrafish</title><fingerprint>13d3986a</fingerprint><description>The ultimate formation of a four-chambered heart allowing the separation of the pulmonary and systemic circuits was key for the evolutionary success of tetrapods.

Background &lt;p&gt;The discussion on the use of bevacizumab is still ongoing and often doctors are deterred from using bevacizumab due to legal or political issues. Bevacizumab is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), albeit unregistered for the disease. Therefore, in some countries ophthalmologists use the equally effective but expensive drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept. We describe the economic consequences of this dilemma surrounding AMD treatment from a societal perspective.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We modelled cost-effectiveness of treatment with ranibizumab (as-needed), aflibercept (bimonthly) and bevacizumab (as-needed). Effectiveness was estimated by systematic review and meta-analysis. The drug with the most favourable cost-effectiveness profile compared to bevacizumab was used for threshold analyses. First, we determined how much we overspend per injection. Second, we calculated the required effectiveness to justify the current price and the reasonable price for a drug leading to optimal vision. Finally, we estimated how much Europe overspends if bevacizumab is not first choice.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab treatment costs €27,087 per year, about €4,000 less than aflibercept and €6,000 less than ranibizumab. With similar effectiveness for all drugs as shown by meta-analysis, bevacizumab was the most cost-effective. Aflibercept was chosen for threshold analyses. Aflibercept costs €943 per injection, but we determined that the maximum price to be cost-effective is €533. Alternatively, at its current price, aflibercept should yield about twice the visual gain. Even when optimal vision can be achieved, the maximum price for any treatment is €37,453 per year. Most importantly, Europe overspends €335 million yearly on AMD treatment when choosing aflibercept over bevacizumab.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Bevacizumab is the most cost-effective treatment for AMD, yet is not the standard of care across Europe. The registered drugs ranibizumab and aflibercept lead to large overspending without additional health benefits. Health authorities should consider taking steps to implement bevacizumab into clinical practice as first choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Freekje van Asten</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Freekje van Asten, Charlotte T.

Whole genome sequencing of clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates promises to circumvent the long wait times and limited scope of conventional phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility, but gaps remain for predicting phenotype accurately from genotypic data. Methods and Findings: Using targeted or whole genome sequencing and conventional drug resistance phenotyping data from 3,601 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, 1,228 of which were multidrug resistant, we investigated the use of machine learning to predict phenotypic drug resistance to 10 anti-tuberculosis drugs.

Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common of the human porphyrias, arises from a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Studies have shown a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in patients with PCT. While these observations implicate HCV infection as a risk factor for PCT pathogenesis, the mechanism of interaction between the virus and porphyrin metabolism is unknown. This study aimed to assess the effect of HCV core protein on intracellular porphyrin metabolism to elucidate the link between HCV infection and PCT. The accumulation and excretion of porphyrins after treatment with 5-aminolevulinic acid, a porphyrin precursor, were compared between cells stably expressing HCV core protein and controls. Cells expressing HCV core protein had lower amounts of intracellular protoporphyrin IX and heme and had higher amounts of excreted coproporphyrin III, the oxidized form of coproporphyrinogen III, compared with controls. These observations suggest that HCV core protein affects porphyrin metabolism and facilitates the export of excess coproporphyrinogen III and/or coproporphyrin III, possibly via porphyrin transporters. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the presence of HCV core protein increased the mRNA expression of porphyrin exporters ABCG2 and FLVCR1. Western blot analysis showed a higher expression level of FLVCR1, but not ABCG2, as well as a higher expression level of mature ALAS1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme synthesis pathway, in HCV core protein-expressing cells compared with controls. The data indicate that HCV core protein induced abnormal intracellular porphyrin metabolism, with an over-excretion of coproporphyrin III. These findings may partially account for the susceptibility of HCV-infected individuals to PCT development.</content></content><author><name>Takafumi Nakano</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Takafumi Nakano, Kyoji Moriya, Kazuhiko Koike, Toshiharu Horie&lt;/p&gt;

Background &lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially by using rapid molecular assays, can reduce transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis in communities. However, the frequency of resistance conferring mutations varies with geographic location of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;, and this affects the efficiency of rapid molecular assays in detecting resistance. This has created need for characterizing drug resistant isolates from different settings to investigate frequencies of resistance conferring mutations. Here, we describe the prevalence and patterns of rifampicin- and isoniazid- resistance conferring mutations in isolates from Uganda, which could be useful in the management of MDR-TB patients in Uganda and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt; Results &lt;p&gt;Ninety seven &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; isolates were characterized, of which 38 were MDR, seven rifampicin-resistant, 12 isoniazid-mono-resistant, and 40 susceptible to rifampicin and isoniazid. Sequence analysis of the &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt; rifampicin-resistance determining region (&lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR) revealed mutations in six codons: 588, 531, 526, 516, 513, and 511, of which Ser531Leu was the most frequent (40%, 18/45). Overall, the three mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) frequently associated with rifampicin-resistance occurred in 76% of the rifampicin resistant isolates while 18% (8/45) of the rifampicin-resistant isolates lacked mutations in &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR. Furthermore, sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter revealed mainly the Ser315Thr (76%, 38/50) and C(-15)T (8%, 4/50) mutations, respectively. These two mutations combined, which are frequently associated with isoniazid-resistance, occurred in 88% of the isoniazid resistant isolates. However, 20% (10/50) of the isoniazid-resistant isolates lacked mutations both in &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter. The sensitivity of sequence analysis of &lt;i&gt;rpoB&lt;/i&gt;/RRDR for rifampicin-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser531Leu, His526Tyr, Asp516Tyr) was 81%, while it was 77% for analysis of &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;inhA&lt;/i&gt; gene promoter to detect isoniazid-resistance via detection of high confidence mutations (Ser315Thr, C(-15)T, T(-8)C).

In this study, we investigated the relationship between propofol and autophagy and examined whether this relationship depends on ER stress, production of ROS (reactive oxygen species), and disruption of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) homeostasis. To this end, we measured C2C12 cell apoptosis &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, along with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels; ROS production; and expression of proteins and genes associated with autophagy, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, and ER stress, including LC3 (microtubule-associate protein 1 light chain 3), p62, AMPK (adenosine 5’-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase), phosphorylated AMPK, mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), phosphorylated mTOR, CHOP (C/BEP homologous protein), and Grp78/Bip (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein). We found that propofol treatment induced autophagy, ER stress, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release. The ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to AMPK increased, whereas the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR to mTOR decreased.

Our findings contribute to an increasingly detailed portrait of the gene families that defined the biology of the Urmetazoan and that may underpin core features of extant animals.</content></summary><alternate><item><href>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34226</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Evolutionary Biology</item></keywords><crawled>1527768614113</crawled><id>VL8OWctRBAjQSg7yRWbFf6H4x0Apt3RNe5eZxlsLnuA=_163b61b04e1:2fd8759:7cfe07d6</id></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/590?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1525974002000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/590.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>10</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/590?rss=1</link><title>A different animal</title><fingerprint>9f91d836</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_1634b466ab8:159d7f0:93d646dc</id><author><name>Langin, K.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6389/590?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Ecology, Genetics, Science and Policy</item></keywords><crawled>1525976296120</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</originId><origin><title>Science current issue</title><htmlUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml</streamId></origin><published>1527788426000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><canonicalUrl>http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/976.4.full</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</link><title>Triggering quakes in a geothermal space</title><fingerprint>5be5c636</fingerprint><id>uYuHkca+SUqlKx8hrJBJkCoW+psRQpxBOVPrNKf627U=_163b7aef984:32d09b1:2835af05</id><author><name>Grocholski, B.</name></author><alternate><item><href>http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/360/6392/976-d?rss=1</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><keywords><item>Geochemistry, Geophysics</item></keywords><crawled>1527795087748</crawled><visual><url>none</url></visual></item><item><originId>10.1371/journal.pone.0198065</originId><origin><title>PLOS ONE</title><htmlUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://journals.plos.org/plosone/feed/atom</streamId></origin><published>1527714000000</published><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><updated>1527714000000</updated><canonicalUrl>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0198065</canonicalUrl><engagement>0</engagement><link>10.1371/journal.pone.0198065</link><title>MR-CBCT image-guided system for radiotherapy of orthotopic rat prostate tumors</title><fingerprint>d3e13a10</fingerprint><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;by Tsuicheng D.

Multi-modality image-guided radiotherapy is the standard of care in contemporary cancer management; however, it is not common in preclinical settings due to both hardware and software limitations. Soft tissue lesions, such as orthotopic prostate tumors, are difficult to identify using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging alone. In this study, we characterized a research magnetic resonance (MR) scanner for preclinical studies and created a protocol for combined MR-CBCT image-guided small animal radiotherapy. Two in-house dual-modality, MR and CBCT compatible, phantoms were designed and manufactured using 3D printing technology. The phantoms were used for quality assurance tests and to facilitate end-to-end testing for combined preclinical MR and CBCT based treatment planning. MR and CBCT images of the phantoms were acquired utilizing a Varian 4.7 T scanner and XRad-225Cx irradiator, respectively. The geometry distortion was assessed by comparing MR images to phantom blueprints and CBCT. The corrected MR scans were co-registered with CBCT and subsequently used for treatment planning. The fidelity of 3D printed phantoms compared to the blueprint design yielded favorable agreement as verified with the CBCT measurements. The geometric distortion, which varied between -5% and 11% throughout the scanning volume, was substantially reduced to within 0.4% after correction. The distortion free MR images were co-registered with the corresponding CBCT images and imported into a commercial treatment planning software SmART Plan. The planning target volume (PTV) was on average 19% smaller when contoured on the corrected MR-CBCT images relative to raw images without distortion correction. An MR-CBCT based preclinical workflow was successfully designed and implemented for small animal radiotherapy. Combined MR-CBCT image-guided radiotherapy for preclinical research potentially delivers enhanced relevance to human radiotherapy for various disease sites. This novel protocol is wide-ranging and not limited to the orthotopic prostate tumor study presented in the study.</content></content><author><name>Tsuicheng D.

The neural mechanisms underlying visual perceptual learning (VPL) have typically been studied by examining changes in task-related brain activation after training. However, the relationship between post-task “offline” processes and VPL remains unclear. The present study examined this question by obtaining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of human brains before and after a task-fMRI session involving visual perceptual training. During the task-fMRI session, participants performed a motion coherence discrimination task in which they judged the direction of moving dots with a coherence level that varied between trials (20, 40, and 80%). We found that stimulus-induced activation increased with motion coherence in the middle temporal cortex (MT+), a feature-specific region representing visual motion. On the other hand, stimulus-induced activation decreased with motion coherence in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral insula, regions involved in decision making under perceptual ambiguity. Moreover, by comparing pre-task and post-task rest periods, we revealed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) with the MT+ was significantly increased after training in widespread cortical regions including the bilateral sensorimotor and temporal cortices. In contrast, rs-FC with the MT+ was significantly decreased in subcortical regions including the thalamus and putamen. Importantly, the training-induced change in rs-FC was observed only with the MT+, but not with the dACC or insula. Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</content></content><author><name>Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mitra Taghizadeh Sarabi, Ryuta Aoki, Kaho Tsumura, Ruedeerat Keerativittayayut, Koji Jimura, Kiyoshi Nakahara&lt;/p&gt;

Thus, our findings suggest that perceptual training induces plastic changes in offline functional connectivity specifically in brain regions representing the trained visual feature, emphasising the distinct roles of feature-representation regions and decision-related regions in VPL.</description><alternate><item><href>http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196866</href><type>text/html</type></item></alternate><unread>True</unread><crawled>1525887732958</crawled><id>BuiUwMVj/Cp3NHClC4Ko8ofzVMH7GqVeiChtEpKSiXg=_16345ff0cde:d3bed5:2835af05</id></item><item><originId>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149</originId><origin><title>Nature Biotechnology</title><htmlUrl>http://feeds.nature.com/nbt/rss/current</htmlUrl><streamId>feed/http://www.nature.com/nbt/current_issue/rss/</streamId></origin><author><name>NA</name></author><id>0qZSsMpEyvTD/JmJ6fQGs2jjQHT0cDASmHnvbQXUs9I=_1633b5ecdc2:29a635c:93d646dc</id><categories><item><label>journalblitz</label><id>user/54bfafe6-b2f6-43fa-96fe-3d8989ac4cd9/category/journalblitz</id></item></categories><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149</link><title>Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger</title><fingerprint>c5ea8f6c</fingerprint><engagement>1</engagement><content><direction>ltr</direction><content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unleashing biotech&apos;s crouching tiger, Published online: 09 May 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4149&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/nbt.4149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With a massive expansion in healthcare coverage, biotech&apos;s next big boom could occur in India.

The search for general properties in network structure has been a central issue for food web studies in recent years. One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.</content></content><author><name>Tomás Ignacio Marina</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Tomás Ignacio Marina, Leonardo A.

Objective &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact of being bullied at school on current psychological distress and work engagement in adulthood among Japanese workers. We hypothesized that workers who had been bullied at school could have higher psychological distress and lower work engagement compared to those who had not been bullied.&lt;/p&gt; Methods &lt;p&gt;We used data from the Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood (J-SHINE) project, conducted from July 2010 to February 2011 in Japan. This survey randomly selected the local residents around a metropolitan area in Japan. Of 13,920 adults originally selected, 4,317 people participated this survey, and the total response rate was 31%. The self-administered questionnaires assessed current psychological distress (K6), work engagement (UWES), the experiences of being bullied in elementary or junior high school and other covariates. Statistical analyses were conducted only for workers. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between experiences of being bullied at school and psychological distress/work engagement, with six steps.&lt;/p&gt; Result &lt;p&gt;Statistical analysis was conducted for 3,111 workers. The number of respondents who reported being bullied in elementary or junior high school was 1,318 (42%). We found that the experience of being bullied at school was significantly associated with high psychological distress in adulthood (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .079, p = &amp;lt; .0001); however, the work engagement scores of respondents who were bullied were significantly higher than for people who were not bullied at school (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = .068, p = &amp;lt; .0001), after adjusting all covariates.&lt;/p&gt; Conclusion &lt;p&gt;Being bullied at school was positively associated with both psychological distress and work engagement in a sample of workers. Being bullied at school may be a predisposing factor for psychological distress, as previously reported. The higher levels of work engagement among people who experienced being bullied at school may be because some of them might have overcome the experience to gain more psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></content><author><name>Mai Iwanaga</name></author><description>&lt;p&gt;by Mai Iwanaga, Kotaro Imamura, Akihito Shimazu, Norito Kawakami&lt;/p&gt;
