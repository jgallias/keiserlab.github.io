Our lab has received a UCSF [Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/) New Frontier Research Award for 2016-2017. This program provides funding for projects with high-impact potential that are creative, risky, and transformative. With this support, we're diving into some entirely new directions that combine machine learning with small-molecule screens.
