The Systems Administrator manages two different computer clusters and interacts with a third. The [Irwin](http://irwinlab.compbio.ucsf.edu/) / [Shoichet](http://www.bkslab.org/) lab requires system administration, cluster administration, new hardware purchasing, new system deployment, maintenance of disks that fail, and desktop support for 20 lab members. The Keiser lab requires many of the same skills as the Irwin / Shoichet labm with an emphasis on supporting AI workflows and DevOps. Both clusters are supported by the [UCSF Wynton Cluster](https://wynton.ucsf.edu/), with which the two lab clusters must interoperate. The work thus requires interacting with a large number of different people and technicians, more complex network configurations, and managing more complex interdependencies of heterogeneous systems.

This position works in the Shoichet lab which develops new methods for drug discovery and the Keiser lab which researches multi-target drug activity at the molecular level using machine and deep learning. The position helps with analyzing, evaluating, moving, and maintaining the IT cluster architecture without an interruption in service.
