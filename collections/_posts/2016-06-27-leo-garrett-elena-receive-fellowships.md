Leo, Garrett, and Elena knock it out of the park. In a record summer (hereafter to be known for far more than what some sources dub a 'shocking' Game of Thrones season 6 finale),

1. Leo is named a [Fletcher Jones Fellow](http://graduate.ucsf.edu/internal-fellowships#recipients) in acknowledgement of research accomplishments & excellence;
2. Garrett secures a competitive [Genentech Fellowship](http://graduate.ucsf.edu/internal-fellowships#recipients) for biomedical research, hot on the heels of last year's [Hillblom](/news/garrett-named-hillblom-fellow/); &
3. Along with her [NSF GRF](/news/elena-receive-nsf-grfp-fellowship/), Elena is now a [HHMI Gilliam Fellow](http://www.hhmi.org/news/gilliam-fellowships-awarded-34-students-support-diversity-sciences).

Celebrations to follow.
