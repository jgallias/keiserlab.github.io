As a lab we are deeply disturbed by the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and many more. Recent events throughout the US underscore the systemic racism that permeates every level of our society, as we have observed through inequality in the criminal justice system, over-policing, and voter suppression.

Within the lab, over the past months we have engaged in a conscientious shift toward normalizing discussions on inequity and race, both as part of regular dedicated meetings as well as in daily conversation. As lab citizens, we are working to educate ourselves on our own biases, become better mentors, and volunteer time to local and scientific communities in an ongoing and long-term way.

We have recently adopted multiple changes to the way the lab functions, as described in our new [Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) section of the site](/dei). Additionally, lab members have:

1. Volunteered for outreach programs such as:
    - [AI4All](https://ai4all.ucsf.edu/),
    - the Lowell High School science program,
    - Impact Oakland, and
    - [Skype A Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/).
2. Joined graduate program DEI and admissions committees and co-led task forces to identify and break down privilege structures and policies that exclude or marginalize black trainees.
3. Taken coursework in:
    - [UCSF TRAIN-UP](https://career.ucsf.edu/events/train-up-course) mentorship,
    - [UCSF DEI Champion](https://differencesmatter.ucsf.edu/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-champion-training) training, and
    - Year-long [HHMI Gilliam program](https://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/gilliam-fellowships-advanced-study) training.
4. Participated for several years in the [UCSF Summer Research Training Program (SRTP)](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/srtp) and have mentored high school and undergraduate interns in the lab.

We recognize however that this is only a start.

Going forward, the new [DEI section of our website](/dei) will be a space for lab members to update and document our efforts, and as means to hold ourselves accountable to ourselves and to the public.
