The Keiser Lab at UCSF is looking for highly motivated postdoctoral candidates with a background in machine learning, pathology, biomedical image analysis, or related fields. Research projects in neuropathology, dermatopathology, and ophthalmic pathology are available, with opportunities to develop and extend further clinical collaborations. These may include molecular pathology. Broad themes across these application domains include model interpretability and representation learning.

### Qualifications

- Python data science expertise required
- Desired skills include experience with PyTorch, pandas, OpenCV, pyvips, and sklearn, or the demonstrated ability to acquire this expertise in a timely manner
- Expertise with containers (e.g., singularity), AI-ops (e.g., CI/CD for ML), rapid caching, performant data formats (e.g., zarr), and/or distributed dataset/model analysis is a plus

A productive track record with at least one first-author publication is required. We seek a driven individual who will lead her/his research independently and communicate frequently and clearly to the field.

### Environment

Just north of Silicon Valley, the lab’s location at UCSF Mission Bay directly adjoins SoMa district and the heart of SF’s tech and artificial intelligence startup scene.

### How to apply

Interested candidates should submit a CV and arrange that three letters of reference be sent directly to apply@keiserlab.org. Please reference “postdoc-dnn-pathology”.
