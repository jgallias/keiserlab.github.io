Widespread protests in Iran have been sparked by the brutal murder of Mahsa Amini by the regime's "morality" police, for not wearing hijab compliant clothing properly. Since then, Iranian people have carried nationwide protests in condemnation of police brutality, systemic harassment and abuse of women, torture at the hands of security forces and calling for basic human rights. Reports suggest the ongoing crackdown has seen about 180 people killed including children and thousands imprisoned. Students at Sharif university in Tehran, among other universities in Iran, readily joined the movement. Unfortunately, on October 2nd, the protests at Sharif University were met with violent shootings and beatings by security forces who stormed the campuses and imprisoned student demonstrators. This act is in grave violation of human rights and free speech and defies the dignity of academia. 
 
We, at Keiser Lab at the University of California, San Francisco, support the safety of Iranian civilians and university student demonstrators who are fighting for their basic human rights. We stand united with all those who have been affected by the death and torture of Mahsa Amini and are fighting for the civil and political rights of women, LGBTQ+ people, and racial, religious and ethnic minorities under repressive laws, coercion, physical brutality, imprisonment and extrajudicial executions. 
 
We have no doubt that this perilous moment will bring about a better future and meanwhile we continue to support Iranians fighting for their basic rights.
