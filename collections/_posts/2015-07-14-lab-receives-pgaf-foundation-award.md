Our lab has been selected by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation's [Allen Distinguished Investigator (ADI) Program](http://www.pgafamilyfoundation.org/programs/investigators-fellows/key-initiative/adi-alzheimers-disease-research) to investigate the fundamental cellular biology of Alzheimer's Disease in completely new ways.

Working with the [Kampmann](http://kampmannlab.ucsf.edu/) and [Kokel](http://kokellab.com) labs, we will be combining our systems pharmacology, functional genomics, and zebrafish behavioral screening platforms with data on half a million compounds from the [Prusiner](http://ind.ucsf.edu/ind/aboutus/faculty/prusiners) lab to find new combinations of targets controlling Alzheimer's Disease processes in human cells. We'll explore the consequences of new target combinations and compounds that modulate them on the protein homeostasis network with the [Gestwicki](http://gestwickilab.ucsf.edu/) lab.
