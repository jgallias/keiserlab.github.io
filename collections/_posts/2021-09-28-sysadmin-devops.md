The Research Lab System Administrator will work in the Keiser lab which researches multi-target drug activity at the molecular level. The position helps with analyzing, evaluating, moving, and maintaining the IT cluster architecture without an interruption in service.

The Research Lab System Administrator manages, maintains, administers, and is the first point of responsibility for Keiser Lab’s entire computational hardware, software, and data infrastructure.
