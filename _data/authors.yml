  bio_long: "Michael completed a bioinformatics Ph.D. in 2009 at UCSF as a National Science Foundation Fellow, where he developed techniques to relate drugs and proteins based on the statistical similarity of their ligands, such as the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA). He also holds B.Sc., B.A., and M.A. degrees from Stanford University. He subsequently co-founded a startup bringing these methods to pharma companies and the US FDA. Keiser joined the faculty at UCSF in the Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in 2014, with a joint appointment in the Dept. of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences."

  bio_long: "Traditional approaches for ligand similarity, such as neighborhood or path based fingerprints, are based on molecular patterns, containing little information about the physics underlying protein-ligand recognition events. I am using a combined cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics approach to construct a thesaurus for ligand-based scaffolds, related via their interaction patterns with proteins from high-resolution x-ray crystals. This thesaurus will then be used to construct 3D interaction fingerprints for use in SEA (Similarity Ensemble Approach), for constraining or filtering virtual screening experiments, and for designing ligand-binding proteins. In developing these interaction fingerprints, we differ philosophically from previous fingerprinting approaches in that we strive to capture statistically enriched many-body interactions instead of painting yet another unsatisfying pairwise landscape."
