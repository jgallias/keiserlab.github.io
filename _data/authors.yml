  bio_long: "<p>Michael is a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Ben Barres Investigator and a Paul G. Allen Distinguished Investigator. Michael joined the UCSF faculty as an Assistant Professor in 2014, in the Dept. of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, with appointments in the Dept. of Bioengineering & Therapeutic Sciences and the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute. He is also a member of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute and the Kavli Institute for Fundamental Neuroscience at UCSF.</p>
<p>Before this, he co-founded a startup bringing systems pharmacology methods for drug-target prediction to pharma and the US FDA, where they are in use today. During his bioinformatics Ph.D. at UCSF as a NSF Fellow, Michael developed techniques to relate drugs and proteins from the statistical similarity of their ligands, such as the Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA). He holds multiple degrees from Stanford, including a BSc. in Computer Science.</p>"

will_connell:
  name: Will Connell
  email: connell@keiserlab.org
  bio: "pspg"
  bio_long: "Currently, clinicians practice medicine on a population level. The ability to molecularly characterize biological systems affords new opportunities in the personalization of patient treatment. Proper integration and interpretation of biological data types are necessary to deconvolute individual homeostatic imbalances. Network representation of this information most closely resembles our current models, and the application of machine learning methods to this data structure can help us understand complex interactions. Will is a student in the Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics graduate degree program."

garrett_gaskins:
  name: Garrett Gaskins
  email: gaskins@keiserlab.org
  bio: "bioinformatics"
  bio_long: "High-content screening across varied cells, conditions, and chemical libraries has emerged as a key method for identifying novel compounds capable of systematically perturbing a biological network to induce a phenotype. The molecular targets (proteins, receptors, etc.) through which these compounds act to achieve their phenotype(s) are typically unknown. I am currently developing a chemoinformatic approach using aspects of image processing, machine learning, and SEA to identify the targets of novel compounds via their phenotypic signature."
