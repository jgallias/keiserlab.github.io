AB  - Ahneman et al (Reports, 13 April 2018) applied machine learning models to predict
      C-N cross-coupling reaction yields. The models use atomic, electronic, and
      vibrational descriptors as input features. However, the experimental design is
      insufficient to distinguish models trained on chemical features from those
      trained solely on random-valued features in retrospective and prospective test
      scenarios, thus failing classical controls in machine learning.

AB  - New machine learning methods to analyze raw chemical and biological data are now 
      widely accessible as open-source toolkits. This positions researchers to leverage
      powerful, predictive models in their own domains. We caution, however, that the
      application of machine learning to experimental research merits careful
      consideration. Machine learning algorithms readily exploit confounding variables 
      and experimental artifacts instead of relevant patterns, leading to
      overoptimistic performance and poor model generalization. In parallel to the
      strong control experiments that remain a cornerstone of experimental research, we
      advance the concept of adversarial controls for scientific machine learning: the 
      design of exacting and purposeful experiments to ensure that predictive
      performance arises from meaningful models.

AB  - Although gene discovery in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum 
      disorder, intellectual disability, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Tourette
      disorder, has accelerated, resulting in a large number of molecular clues, it has
      proven difficult to generate specific hypotheses without the corresponding
      datasets at the protein complex and functional pathway level. Here, we describe
      one path forward-an initiative aimed at mapping the physical and genetic
      interaction networks of these conditions and then using these maps to connect the
      genomic data to neurobiology and, ultimately, the clinic. These efforts will
      include a team of geneticists, structural biologists, neurobiologists, systems
      biologists, and clinicians, leveraging a wide array of experimental approaches
      and creating a collaborative infrastructure necessary for long-term
      investigation. This initiative will ultimately intersect with parallel studies
      that focus on other diseases, as there is a significant overlap with genes
      implicated in cancer, infectious disease, and congenital heart defects.

TI  - Predicted Biological Activity of Purchasable Chemical Space.
PG  - 148-164
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.7b00316 [doi]
AB  - Whereas 400 million distinct compounds are now purchasable within the span of a
      few weeks, the biological activities of most are unknown. To facilitate access to
      new chemistry for biology, we have combined the Similarity Ensemble Approach
      (SEA) with the maximum Tanimoto similarity to the nearest bioactive to predict
      activity for every commercially available molecule in ZINC. This method, which we
      label SEA+TC, outperforms both SEA and a naive-Bayesian classifier via predictive
      performance on a 5-fold cross-validation of ChEMBL's bioactivity data set
      (version 21). Using this method, predictions for over 40% of compounds (>160
      million) have either high significance (pSEA >/= 40), high similarity (ECFP4MaxTc
      >/= 0.4), or both, for one or more of 1382 targets well described by ligands in
      the literature. Using a further 1347 less-well-described targets, we predict
      activities for an additional 11 million compounds. To gauge whether these
      predictions are sensible, we investigate 75 predictions for 50 drugs lacking a
      binding affinity annotation in ChEMBL. The 535 million predictions for over 171
      million compounds at 2629 targets are linked to purchasing information and
      evidence to support each prediction and are freely available via
      https://zinc15.docking.org and https://files.docking.org .

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) chemical protection depends upon discrete control of
      small-molecule access by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Curiously, some drugs
      cause CNS side-effects despite negligible transit past the BBB. To investigate
      this phenomenon, we asked whether the highly BBB-enriched drug efflux transporter
      MDR1 has dual functions in controlling drug and endogenous molecule CNS
      homeostasis. If this is true, then brain-impermeable drugs could induce
      behavioral changes by affecting brain levels of endogenous molecules. Using
      computational, genetic, and pharmacologic approaches across diverse organisms, we
      demonstrate that BBB-localized efflux transporters are critical for regulating
      brain levels of endogenous steroids and steroid-regulated behaviors (sleep in
      Drosophila and anxiety in mice). Furthermore, we show that MDR1-interacting drugs
      are associated with anxiety-related behaviors in humans. We propose a general
      mechanism for common behavioral side effects of prescription drugs:
      pharmacologically challenging BBB efflux transporters disrupts brain levels of
      endogenous substrates and implicates the BBB in behavioral regulation.

AB  - Statistical and machine learning approaches predict drug-to-target relationships 
      from 2D small-molecule topology patterns. One might expect 3D information to
      improve these calculations. Here we apply the logic of the extended connectivity 
      fingerprint (ECFP) to develop a rapid, alignment-invariant 3D representation of
      molecular conformers, the extended three-dimensional fingerprint (E3FP). By
      integrating E3FP with the similarity ensemble approach (SEA), we achieve higher
      precision-recall performance relative to SEA with ECFP on ChEMBL20 and equivalent
      receiver operating characteristic performance. We identify classes of molecules
      for which E3FP is a better predictor of similarity in bioactivity than is ECFP.
      Finally, we report novel drug-to-target binding predictions inaccessible by 2D
      fingerprints and confirm three of them experimentally with ligand efficiencies
      from 0.442-0.637 kcal/mol/heavy atom.

TI  - Zebrafish behavioral profiling identifies multitarget antipsychotic-like
      compounds.
PG  - 559-66
LID - 10.1038/nchembio.2097 [doi]
AB  - Many psychiatric drugs act on multiple targets and therefore require screening
      assays that encompass a wide target space. With sufficiently rich phenotyping and
      a large sampling of compounds, it should be possible to identify compounds with
      desired mechanisms of action on the basis of behavioral profiles alone. Although 
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has been used to rapidly identify neuroactive
      compounds, it is not clear what types of behavioral assays would be necessary to 
      identify multitarget compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a
      battery of behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine whether behavioral 
      profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic resolution to identify and classify
      psychiatric drugs. Using the antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a test case, we
      found that behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated zebrafish could be used to 
      identify previously uncharacterized compounds with desired antipsychotic-like
      activities and multitarget mechanisms of action.

AB  - Many psychiatric drugs modulate the nervous system through multitarget
      mechanisms. However, systematic identification of multitarget compounds has been 
      difficult using traditional in vitro screening assays. New approaches to
      phenotypic profiling in zebrafish can help researchers identify novel compounds
      with complex polypharmacology. For example, large-scale behavior-based chemical
      screens can rapidly identify large numbers of structurally diverse and
      phenotype-related compounds. Once these compounds have been identified, a
      systems-level analysis of their structures may help to identify statistically
      enriched target pathways. Together, systematic behavioral profiling and
      multitarget predictions may help researchers identify new behavior-modifying
      pathways and CNS therapeutics.

TI  - Polygenic overlap between schizophrenia risk and antipsychotic response: a
      genomic medicine approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic treatments for schizophrenia do not alleviate symptoms
      for all patients and efficacy is limited by common, often severe, side-effects.
      Genetic studies of disease can identify novel drug targets, and drugs for which
      the mechanism has direct genetic support have increased likelihood of clinical
      success. Large-scale genetic studies of schizophrenia have increased the number
      of genes and gene sets associated with risk. We aimed to examine the overlap
      between schizophrenia risk loci and gene targets of a comprehensive set of
      medications to potentially inform and improve treatment of schizophrenia.
      METHODS: We defined schizophrenia risk loci as genomic regions reaching
      genome-wide significance in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
      schizophrenia genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 36 989 cases and 113 075
      controls and loss of function variants observed only once among 5079 individuals 
      in an exome-sequencing study of 2536 schizophrenia cases and 2543 controls
      (Swedish Schizophrenia Study). Using two large and orthogonally created
      databases, we collated drug targets into 167 gene sets targeted by
      pharmacologically similar drugs and examined enrichment of schizophrenia risk
      loci in these sets. We further linked the exome-sequenced data with a national
      drug registry (the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register) to assess the contribution
      of rare variants to treatment response, using clozapine prescription as a proxy
      for treatment resistance. FINDINGS: We combined results from testing rare and
      common variation and, after correction for multiple testing, two gene sets were
      associated with schizophrenia risk: agents against amoebiasis and other protozoal
      diseases (106 genes, p=0.00046, pcorrected =0.024) and antipsychotics (347 genes,
      p=0.00078, pcorrected=0.046). Further analysis pointed to antipsychotics as
      having independent enrichment after removing genes that overlapped these two
      target sets. We noted significant enrichment both in known targets of
      antipsychotics (70 genes, p=0.0078) and novel predicted targets (277 genes,
      p=0.019). Patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia had an excess of rare
      disruptive variants in gene targets of antipsychotics (347 genes, p=0.0067) and
      in genes with evidence for a role in antipsychotic efficacy (91 genes, p=0.0029).
      INTERPRETATION: Our results support genetic overlap between schizophrenia
      pathogenesis and antipsychotic mechanism of action. This finding is consistent
      with treatment efficacy being polygenic and suggests that single-target
      therapeutics might be insufficient. We provide evidence of a role for rare
      functional variants in antipsychotic treatment response, pointing to a subset of 
      patients where their genetic information could inform treatment. Finally, we
      present a novel framework for identifying treatments from genetic data and
      improving our understanding of therapeutic mechanism. FUNDING: US National

AB  - Metformin, an established first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes,
      has been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects that limit its
      use. Histamine and serotonin have potent effects on the GI tract. The effects of 
      metformin on histamine and serotonin uptake were evaluated in cell lines
      overexpressing several amine transporters (OCT1, OCT3 and SERT). Metformin
      inhibited histamine and serotonin uptake by OCT1, OCT3 and SERT in a
      dose-dependent manner, with OCT1-mediated amine uptake being most potently
      inhibited (IC50 = 1.5 mM). A chemoinformatics-based method known as Similarity
      Ensemble Approach predicted diamine oxidase (DAO) as an additional intestinal
      target of metformin, with an E-value of 7.4 x 10(-5). Inhibition of DAO was
      experimentally validated using a spectrophotometric assay with putrescine as the 
      substrate. The Ki of metformin for DAO was measured to be 8.6 +/- 3.1 mM. In this
      study, we found that metformin inhibited intestinal amine transporters and DAO at
      concentrations that may be achieved in the intestine after therapeutic doses.
      Further studies are warranted to determine the relevance of these interactions to
      the adverse effects of metformin on the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Small molecule drugs are the foundation of modern medical practice, yet their use
      is limited by the onset of unexpected and severe adverse events (AEs). Regulatory
      agencies rely on postmarketing surveillance to monitor safety once drugs are
      approved for clinical use. Despite advances in pharmacovigilance methods that
      address issues of confounding bias, clinical data of AEs are inherently noisy.
      Systems pharmacology-the integration of systems biology and chemical genomics-can
      illuminate drug mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that these data can improve 
      drug safety surveillance by highlighting drugs with a mechanistic connection to
      the target phenotype (enriching true positives) and filtering those that do not
      (depleting false positives). We present an algorithm, the modular assembly of
      drug safety subnetworks (MADSS), to combine systems pharmacology and
      pharmacovigilance data and significantly improve drug safety monitoring for four 
      clinically relevant adverse drug reactions.

      distinct targets that regulate feeding.

AB  - Phenotypic screens can identify molecules that are at once penetrant and active
      on the integrated circuitry of a whole cell or organism. These advantages are
      offset by the need to identify the targets underlying the phenotypes.
      Additionally, logistical considerations limit screening for certain physiological
      and behavioral phenotypes to organisms such as zebrafish and C. elegans. This
      further raises the challenge of elucidating whether compound-target relationships
      found in model organisms are preserved in humans. To address these challenges we 
      searched for compounds that affect feeding behavior in C. elegans and sought to
      identify their molecular mechanisms of action. Here, we applied predictive
      chemoinformatics to small molecules previously identified in a C. elegans
      phenotypic screen likely to be enriched for feeding regulatory compounds. Based
      on the predictions, 16 of these compounds were tested in vitro against 20
      mammalian targets. Of these, nine were active, with affinities ranging from 9 nM 
      to 10 microM. Four of these nine compounds were found to alter feeding. We then
      verified the in vitro findings in vivo through genetic knockdowns, the use of
      previously characterized compounds with high affinity for the four targets, and
      chemical genetic epistasis, which is the effect of combined chemical and genetic 
      perturbations on a phenotype relative to that of each perturbation in isolation. 
      Our findings reveal four previously unrecognized pathways that regulate feeding
      in C. elegans with strong parallels in mammals. Together, our study addresses
      three inherent challenges in phenotypic screening: the identification of the
      molecular targets from a phenotypic screen, the confirmation of the in vivo
      relevance of these targets, and the evolutionary conservation and relevance of
      these targets to their human orthologs.

TI  - Large-scale prediction and testing of drug activity on side-effect targets.
PG  - 361-7
LID - 10.1038/nature11159 [doi]
AB  - Discovering the unintended 'off-targets' that predict adverse drug reactions is
      daunting by empirical methods alone. Drugs can act on several protein targets,
      some of which can be unrelated by conventional molecular metrics, and hundreds of
      proteins have been implicated in side effects. Here we use a computational
      strategy to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended
      'side-effect' targets. Approximately half of the predictions were confirmed,
      either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental
      assays. Affinities for these new off-targets ranged from 1 nM to 30 muM. To
      explore relevance, we developed an association metric to prioritize those new
      off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given
      drug, creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network. Among these new
      associations was the prediction that the abdominal pain side effect of the
      synthetic oestrogen chlorotrianisene was mediated through its newly discovered
      inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1. The clinical relevance of this
      inhibition was borne out in whole human blood platelet aggregation assays. This
      approach may have wide application to de-risking toxicological liabilities in
      drug discovery.

AB  - Target identification is a core challenge in chemical genetics. Here we use
      chemical similarity to computationally predict the targets of 586 compounds that 
      were active in a zebrafish behavioral assay. Among 20 predictions tested, 11
      compounds had activities ranging from 1 nM to 10,000 nM on the predicted targets.
      The roles of two of these targets were tested in the original zebrafish
      phenotype. Prediction of targets from chemotype is rapid and may be generally
      applicable.

TI  - The presynaptic component of the serotonergic system is required for clozapine's 
      efficacy.
PG  - 638-51
LID - 10.1038/npp.2010.195 [doi]
AB  - Clozapine, by virtue of its absence of extrapyramidal side effects and greater
      efficacy, revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia, although the mechanisms 
      underlying this exceptional activity remain controversial. Combining an unbiased 
      cheminformatics and physical screening approach, we evaluated clozapine's
      activity at >2350 distinct molecular targets. Clozapine, and the closely related 
      atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, interacted potently with a unique
      spectrum of molecular targets. This distinct pattern, which was not shared with
      the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol, suggested that the serotonergic
      neuronal system was a key determinant of clozapine's actions. To test this
      hypothesis, we used pet1(-/-) mice, which are deficient in serotonergic
      presynaptic markers. We discovered that the antipsychotic-like properties of the 
      atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine were abolished in a
      pharmacological model that mimics NMDA-receptor hypofunction in pet1(-/-) mice,
      whereas haloperidol's efficacy was unaffected. These results show that
      clozapine's ability to normalize NMDA-receptor hypofunction, which is
      characteristic of schizophrenia, depends on an intact presynaptic serotonergic
      neuronal system.

AB  - Molecular biology now dominates pharmacology so thoroughly that it is difficult
      to recall that only a generation ago the field was very different. To understand 
      drug action today, we characterize the targets through which they act and new
      drug leads are discovered on the basis of target structure and function. Until
      the mid-1980s the information often flowed in reverse: investigators began with
      organic molecules and sought targets, relating receptors not by sequence or
      structure but by their ligands. Recently, investigators have returned to this
      chemical view of biology, bringing to it systematic and quantitative methods of
      relating targets by their ligands. This has allowed the discovery of new targets 
      for established drugs, suggested the bases for their side effects, and predicted 
      the molecular targets underlying phenotypic screens. The bases for these new
      methods, some of their successes and liabilities, and new opportunities for their
      use are described.

AB  - Virtual and high-throughput screens (HTS) should have complementary strengths and
      weaknesses, but studies that prospectively and comprehensively compare them are
      rare. We undertook a parallel docking and HTS screen of 197861 compounds against 
      cruzain, a thiol protease target for Chagas disease, looking for reversible,
      competitive inhibitors. On workup, 99% of the hits were eliminated as false
      positives, yielding 146 well-behaved, competitive ligands. These fell into five
      chemotypes: two were prioritized by scoring among the top 0.1% of the
      docking-ranked library, two were prioritized by behavior in the HTS and by
      clustering, and one chemotype was prioritized by both approaches. Determination
      of an inhibitor/cruzain crystal structure and comparison of the high-scoring
      docking hits to experiment illuminated the origins of docking false-negatives and
      false-positives. Prioritizing molecules that are both predicted by docking and
      are HTS-active yields well-behaved molecules, relatively unobscured by the
      false-positives to which both techniques are individually prone.

LID - 10.1021/jm901613f [doi]
AB  - The similarity ensemble approach (SEA) relates proteins based on the set-wise
      chemical similarity among their ligands. It can be used to rapidly search large
      compound databases and to build cross-target similarity maps. The emerging maps
      relate targets in ways that reveal relationships one might not recognize based on
      sequence or structural similarities alone. SEA has previously revealed cross talk
      between drugs acting primarily on G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we
      used SEA to look for potential off-target inhibition of the enzyme protein
      farnesyltransferase (PFTase) by commercially available drugs. The inhibition of
      PFTase has profound consequences for oncogenesis, as well as a number of other
      diseases. In the present study, two commercial drugs, Loratadine and Miconazole, 
      were identified as potential ligands for PFTase and subsequently confirmed as
      such experimentally. These results point toward the applicability of SEA for the 
      prediction of not only GPCR-GPCR drug cross talk but also GPCR-enzyme and
      enzyme-enzyme drug cross talk.

TI  - A pilot study of the pharmacodynamic impact of SSRI drug selection and beta-1
      receptor genotype (ADRB1) on cardiac vital signs in depressed patients: a novel
      pharmacogenetic approach.
PG  - 11-22
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The adrenergic beta-1 receptor gene (ADRB1) Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly
      variants differentially affect blood pressure response to beta-blocker therapy.
      Binding site prediction results for fluoxetine and paroxetine in a bioinformatics
      model estimated that each of these particular selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) have high receptor affinity as an "Adrenergic (beta) Blocker,"
      which was confirmed in vitro. This pilot study was conducted to understand the
      relationship between these "beta-blocking" SSRIs (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and 
      cardiac vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP) and heart rate (HR)), when subjects are stratified by ADRB1 genotype.
      Previously ascertained DNA and clinical data was examined from 122 subjects
      recruited for a cross-sectional study of health and well being during SSRI
      pharmacotherapy. A multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine 
      which variables affected cardiac vital signs. There was a significant interaction
      between Arg389Gly variant status and "beta-blocking" SSRIs [p = 0.0353] in
      relation to SBP. Specifically in homozygous Arg389 subjects, those receiving
      "beta-blocking" SSRIs had significantly lower SBP (mean 104 mmHg) compared to the
      group taking other SSRIs (mean 122 mmHg) [p = 0.0437]. In these same homozygous
      Arg389 subjects, those receiving "beta-blocking" SSRIs also had lower HR (mean 60
      bpm) compared to the other SSRIs (mean 79 bpm) [p = 0.00877]. Future prospective 
      studies of this phenomenon are necessary to identify all genetic markers that can
      predict SSRI-associated cardiovascular effects that may be related to the SSRI
      discontinuation syndrome and potentially influence pharmacotherapy decisions.

AB  - Although drugs are intended to be selective, at least some bind to several
      physiological targets, explaining side effects and efficacy. Because many
      drug-target combinations exist, it would be useful to explore possible
      interactions computationally. Here we compared 3,665 US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA)-approved and investigational drugs against hundreds of
      targets, defining each target by its ligands. Chemical similarities between drugs
      and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were
      tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the beta(1) receptor by the
      transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
      transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H(4)
      receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug-target
      associations were confirmed, five of which were potent (<100 nM). The
      physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on
      serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical
      similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects
      and new indications for many drugs.

TI  - A mapping of drug space from the viewpoint of small molecule metabolism.
PG  - e1000474

AB  - Small molecule drugs target many core metabolic enzymes in humans and pathogens, 
      often mimicking endogenous ligands. The effects may be therapeutic or toxic, but 
      are frequently unexpected. A large-scale mapping of the intersection between
      drugs and metabolism is needed to better guide drug discovery. To map the
      intersection between drugs and metabolism, we have grouped drugs and metabolites 
      by their associated targets and enzymes using ligand-based set signatures created
      to quantify their degree of similarity in chemical space. The results reveal the 
      chemical space that has been explored for metabolic targets, where successful
      drugs have been found, and what novel territory remains. To aid other researchers
      in their drug discovery efforts, we have created an online resource of
      interactive maps linking drugs to metabolism. These maps predict the "effect
      space" comprising likely target enzymes for each of the 246 MDDR drug classes in 
      humans. The online resource also provides species-specific interactive
      drug-metabolism maps for each of the 385 model organisms and pathogens in the
      BioCyc database collection. Chemical similarity links between drugs and
      metabolites predict potential toxicity, suggest routes of metabolism, and reveal 
      drug polypharmacology. The metabolic maps enable interactive navigation of the
      vast biological data on potential metabolic drug targets and the drug chemistry
      currently available to prosecute those targets. Thus, this work provides a
      large-scale approach to ligand-based prediction of drug action in small molecule 
      metabolism.

LID - 10.1038/nchembio.180 [doi]
AB  - In lead discovery, libraries of 10(6) molecules are screened for biological
      activity. Given the over 10(60) drug-like molecules thought possible, such
      screens might never succeed. The fact that they do, even occasionally, implies a 
      biased selection of library molecules. We have developed a method to quantify the
      bias in screening libraries toward biogenic molecules. With this approach, we
      consider what is missing from screening libraries and how they can be optimized.

AB  - Chemically similar drugs often bind biologically diverse protein targets, and
      proteins with similar sequences or structures do not always recognize the same
      ligands. How can we uncover the pharmacological relationships among proteins,
      when drugs may bind them in defiance of bioinformatic criteria? Here we consider 
      a technique that quantitatively relates proteins based on the chemical similarity
      of their ligands. Starting with tens of thousands of ligands organized into sets 
      for hundreds of drug targets, we calculated the similarity among sets using
      ligand topology. We developed a statistical model to rank the resulting scores,
      which were then expressed in minimum spanning trees. We have shown that
      biologically sensible groups of targets emerged from these maps, as well as
      experimentally validated predictions of drug off-target effects.

AB  - The similarity of drug targets is typically measured using sequence or structural
      information. Here, we consider chemo-centric approaches that measure target
      similarity on the basis of their ligands, asking how chemoinformatics
      similarities differ from those derived bioinformatically, how stable the ligand
      networks are to changes in chemoinformatics metrics, and which network is the
      most reliable for prediction of pharmacology. We calculated the similarities
      between hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship
      between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on the BLAST
      similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the
      ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach
      (SEA) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria,
      bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only
      occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set
      similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method 
      used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation 
      of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more
      organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts:
      ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.

PG  - 197-206
AB  - The identification of protein function based on biological information is an area
      of intense research. Here we consider a complementary technique that
      quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of
      their ligands. We began with 65,000 ligands annotated into sets for hundreds of
      drug targets. The similarity score between each set was calculated using ligand
      topology. A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the
      resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to
      map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical
      similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among
      unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and
      loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, alpha2 adrenergic and
      neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently
      confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes
      biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands 
      themselves.
